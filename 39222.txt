INTRODUCTION


When General LAizaro Cardenas was President of the Republic of MA(C)xico,
encouragement was given by his administration to linguistic groups of
native American peoples to record in printed form, eventually in their
native languages, accounts of their cultural accomplishments and
accounts of the natural resources of the regions concerned. For the
Tarascan "Empire" centering in the state of MichoacAin, a committee of
Mexicans and citizens of the United States of America was formed to
forward these aims. Under the leadership of ethnologists on the
committee, especially Professor Daniel Rubin F. de la Borbolla and
Professor Ralph L. Beals, invitations to coA¶perate in the studies were
extended to biologists. One of us (Hall) was invited to investigate
the fauna of native wild mammals. In 1943, assisted by a fellowship
which Hall at that time held from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation, and with support from Miss Annie M. Alexander, through the
University of California Museum of Vertebrate ZoA¶logy, most of
March--March 3 to March 29, 1943--was spent in the state of MichoacAin.

Bernardo Villa R. of the Instituto de BiologA-a de la Universidad de
MA(C)xico was a member of the party from March 23 to 27. Previously,
March 4 to 22, Roberto AlcAintar from the Universidad de MichoacAin, in
Morelia, participated in the field work. Mr. J. R. Alcorn was active
in the collecting from the beginning until he entrained for the United
States on March 24. The remainder of the field party was made up of E.
Raymond Hall, his wife Mary F. Hall, and their three sons, William
Joel, Hubert H., and Benjamin D. Hall.

From March 4 to 15 we collected at, and in the vicinity of, PAitzcuaro.
We were housed in two cottages kindly made available by Sr. Efrain
Buenrostro, in Campo Turista Janitzio, 200 meters northwest of the
railroad station in Colonia RevoluciA cubedn. The shore of Lake PAitzcuaro,
the cultivated fields surrounded by stone fences, and the oak and pine
forests roundabout provided varied habitats.

From March 16 to 23 we collected in the territory 1 to 6 miles south
of TacAimbaro, making our headquarters in the Europa Hotel, in the
town. The steep main street of TacAimbaro with native pines at the
upper end descends to plantings of bananas and sugar cane at the lower
end. Our collecting all was done below (south of) the town in the
semitropical country and none at all was done above (north of) the
town.

From March 24 to 27 (three night's trapping) we collected in the
vicinity of Zamora, making our headquarters in rooms diagonally across
the street intersection from the Hotel Fenix.

The resulting specimens, approximately 650 in number, were deposited
in the Museum of Vertebrate ZoA¶logy at the University of California at
Berkeley.

A noteworthy coincidence is that on the very day, February 26, on
which we crossed the international border into MA(C)xico at Laredo, the
beginning of the new volcano, ParicutA-n, was announced in the daily
press. Our collecting of mammals in MichoacAin was nearly all done in
sight of the towering white plume of this rapidly heightening volcanic
cone and frequently our traps were thickly dusted with its wind-borne
ash. Our eagerness at that time to have stations established for
observing the effects on vertebrates of the deposition of ash, was
gratified in that Dr. Robert T. Hatt independently had the same idea
and such observations at appropriate places and times were begun by
him and staff members of the Museum of ZoA¶logy of the University of
Michigan. One of us, Villa, was privileged to share in these
observations in the spring of 1947.

This continuing interest in the mammals of MichoacAin has made it seem,
to us, the more desirable to place on record our findings as to kinds
and occurrence of species. In doing this we have examined the
collections made previously on Cerro TancA-taro and vicinity by the
field party led by Mr. Harry Hoogstraal from the University of
Illinois and the Chicago Natural History Museum. The specimens of
mammals collected by this field party are in the Chicago Natural
History Museum and we are obliged to Mr. Karl P. Schmidt, Mr. Colin C.
Sanborn and the late Dr. Wilfred H. Osgood for the privilege of
studying this material.

Drs. William H. Burt and Emmet T. Hooper, of the Museum of ZoA¶logy of
the University of Michigan, lent to us for examination five specimens
of bats, of as many species, which they had taken in MichoacAin. Drs.
Remington Kellogg and Henry W. Setzer have provided us with data on
specimens of deer and peccary from MichoacAin which are in the United
States National Museum. Specimens in the Institute of Biology of the
University of MA(C)xico have been used. Financial provision by the Kansas
University Endowment Association has enabled us to obtain specimens
needed for comparison from other parts of MA(C)xico.

In addition to the materials mentioned above we have used published
references to mammals of MichoacAin and have prepared the following
lists of kinds of mammals positively known to us to occur in the
Mexican state of MichoacAin. It is noteworthy that specimens recorded
in the literature from AcAimbaro, MichoacAin, no longer are to be
ascribed to MichoacAin, since a relocation of the boundary between the
states of MichoacAin and Guanajuato, places AcAimbaro in the latter
state.

Our aims were: (1) To record kinds of mammals positively known from
the state, under the correct scientific name, and vernacular names in
English, Spanish, and Tarascan. The first Tarascan name is given in
the spelling used by Tarascans followed by the phonetic equivalent in
English in parentheses. (2) To indicate the geographic range of each
kind in the state, and, (3) To record miscellaneous information which
it is thought probably will be useful in one way or another to other
students whose work certainly will lengthen the list of kinds of
mammals known from MichoacAin and otherwise add to our knowledge of
them.

Several kinds of bats, of which we lack records, certainly occur in
MichoacAin. Four or five kinds of cats (genus _Felis_), species of the
genera _Potos_, _Lutra_, _Tayra_, _Grison_, and several other kinds of
mammals of which we now lack positive record, also probably occur
there; the list of kinds, we expect, will number more than one hundred
species and subspecies when more intensive collecting has been done in
the state. In all, we have positive record of 85 kinds of native, wild
mammals of which specimens have been examined or recorded from
MichoacAin. Distances and elevations here are recorded either in the
metric system or in the English system, according to the system used
on the labels of the specimens concerned. Unless otherwise indicated,
catalogue numbers of more than 100,000 are of specimens in the
University of California Museum of Vertebrate ZoA¶logy and numbers of
less than 100,000 are of the Chicago Natural History Museum.

ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES


=Didelphis mesamericana mesamericana= Oken

Opossum; Spanish, Tlacuache; Tarascan, Ujkuri (Ukuri)

    _Did[elphys]. mesamericana_ Oken, Lehrbuch d. Naturgesch.,
       pt. 3, 2:1152, 1816, type from northern MA(C)xico.

    _Didelphis mesamericana_, Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
       16:256, August 18, 1902.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 7: nos. 100063-100067, 100074, 51396,
distributed by localities as follows: PAitzcuaro (3 mi. N, 6,700 ft.,
1; 2 mi. W, 6,700 ft., 2; 5 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 1), 4; TancA-taro, 1;
1-3/4 mi. S TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S TacAimbaro, 1.

_Remarks._--The coarse overhair is white all the way to the base in
three specimens but is black in its distal two thirds (white in basal
third) in four specimens. The overhair, six centimeters anterior to
the base of the tail, is 83 (80-85) mm. long in the three gray
specimens (those with white overhair) and 68 (64-72) mm. long in the
black specimens. The ears and all four feet are black. The tail is
black in its proximal half and white in its distal half except in one
specimen in which the distal half is almost as dark as the proximal
half. Of the two largest specimens, one is a female from 1-3/4 mi. S
TacAimbaro and the other, a male is from 6 mi. S of the same place.
Measurements are: Total length, [M] 810, [F] 786; length of tail, [M]
360, [F] 348; length of hind foot, --, 58; condylobasal length, 110.0;
99.6; zygomatic breadth, 68.5; 59.6; length of nasals, 59.7, 45.0. The
tail amounts to 48, 48 and 47 per cent of the total length in
specimens from PAitzcuaro; 50 per cent in one from TancA-taro; 45 and 44
per cent in two from TacAimbaro. The subspecies _mesamericana_ probably
intergrades with _Didelphis virginiana virginiana_ by way of _D. m.
texensis_ and _D. v. pigra_, as Davis (1944:375) and other writers
suggest, in which case the proper name of the subspecies
_mesamericana_ would be _Didelphis virginiana mesamericana_. Until
intergradation is actually demonstrated, it seems best to use the name
_D. m. mesamericana_.

Most of our specimens were caught in steel traps, at meat baits, set
for small carnivores.


=Marmosa canescens canescens= (Allen)

Murine Opossum; Spanish, RatA cubedn Tlacuache

    _Didelphis (Micoureus) canescens_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.
       Hist., 5:235, September 22, 1893, type from Santo Domingo
       de Guzman, Isthmus of Tehuantepec, MA(C)xico.

    _Marmosa canescens_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:58,
       March 15, 1897.

_Range._--Below _Quercus_ belt, probably throughout western half of
state.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 100062, 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S TacAimbaro,
4,000 ft.

_Remarks._--The one unsexed subadult measures 5.5 mm. from Ml to M3
inclusive, which measurement is near the minimum that Tate (1933:
table 1, Sec. 5) records for this subspecies but larger than the
maximum that he (_loc. cit._) records for the subspecies _sinaloae_
which occurs to the northward of MichoacAin. Tate (_op. cit._:141)
lists two other specimens from Los Reyes. Our specimen was caught in a
mouse trap set in dry grass between a sugar cane field and a patch of
banana trees.


=Sorex saussurei saussurei= Merriam

Saussure Shrew; Spanish, MusaraA+-a

    _Sorex saussurei_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 7:173,
       September 29, 1892, type from north slope Sierra Nevada de
       Colima, approximately 8,000 feet, Jalisco.

_Range._--In and above _Quercus_ belt, probably throughout
northeastern half of state.

_Specimens examined_, 14: nos. 8688, 52131-52141, 100076, 100077,
distributed by localities as follows: PAitzcuaro, 1; 4 mi. S PAitzcuaro,
7,800 ft., 2; Mount TancA-taro (7,800 ft., 8; 9,500 ft., 1; 9,600 ft.,
1; 10,000 ft., 1), 11.

_Remarks._--Two males from Mount TancA-taro, with much worn teeth,
catalogue nos. 52132 and 52138, measure, respectively, as follows:
Total length, 122, 114; length of tail, 46, 43; length of hind foot,
15, 14; condylobasal length, 18.4, 18.3; palatal length, 8.0, 7.3;
cranial breadth, 9.4, 9.2; least interorbital breadth, 3.7, 3.8;
maxillary breadth, 5.5, 5.5; maxillary tooth-row, 6.8, 6.7. The long
palate in no. 52132 and the broad brain case in both specimens appear
to be only individual variations or possibly variations correlated
with the advanced age of the two animals since in other features they
do not differ from specimens which are smaller in these two
dimensions. Jackson (1928:156) records specimens of this shrew from
Mount PatambAin and Nahuatzin.


=Cryptotis pergracilis pergracilis= (Elliot)

Short-tailed Shrew; Spanish, MusaraA+-a Colicorta

    _Blarina pergracilis_ Elliot, Field Columb. Mus., publ. 71,
       zoA¶l. ser., 3:149, February, 1903, type from Ocotlan, Jalisco,
       MA(C)xico.

    _Cryptotis pergracilis pergracilis_, Miller, Proc. Biol. Soc.
       Washington, 24:223, October 31, 1911.

_Range._--Probably statewide.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 1721 B. Villa R. from Colonia Ibarra,
PAitzcuaro.

_Remarks._--Our one specimen, originally a mount, proves to have a
crushed brain case. The specimen was saved on March 10, 1944, by P.
Luna, who in March, 1943, told one of us (Hall) that many of these
shrews fell into the cement fish-rearing tanks at the biological
station situated at Colonia Ibarra, a suburb of PAitzcuaro, on the
shore of Lake PAitzcuaro. We are indebted to Dr. H. H. T. Jackson for
examining our specimen and assigning a name to it.


=Balantiopteryx plicata= Peters

Sac-winged Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Sacoptero; Tarascan word for bat
is HuasA-s (Wasis)

    _Balantiopteryx plicata_ Peters, Monatsber. k. preuss. Akad.
       Wiss. Berlin, p. 476, 1867, type from Puntaarenas, Costa Rica.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 2: nos. 52224, 52225, from Apatzingan, 1,040 ft.

_Remarks._--This bat is a cave dweller, not infrequently found
roosting with other species.


=Glossophaga soricina leachii= (Gray)

Long-tongued Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago SiricotA(C)ro

    _Monophyllus leachii_ Gray, Voyage of the Sulphur, ZoA¶l.,
       1:18, 1844, type from Realejo, Nicaragua.

    _Glossophaga soricina leachii_, Miller, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus.,
       46:419, December 31, 1913.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 4: nos. 11377, Univ. Kan., and alcoholic
specimens nos. 950-952 B. Villa R. field numbers, I. B. (specimens in
Instituto de BiologA-a, Univ. de MA(C)xico), distributed by localities as
follows: Hacienda El Sabino, MichoacAin, approximately 25 mi. S
Uruapan, 1; El Guayabo, 34 kms. S Uruapan, 3.

_Remarks._--Specimens from El Guayabo were taken in a natural cave
which they shared with _Desmodus rotundus murinus_ and _Artibeus
planirostris planirostris_.

       *       *       *       *       *

The length of the thumb averages 7.4 mm. (7.0 to 7.7). As compared
with _G. s. alticola_ from northeast Tlaxcala according to the
description given by Davis (1944:377), our specimens agree with
_alticola_ in length of thumb. In all other characters they correspond
to _leachii_.


=Choeronycteris mexicana= Tschudi

Long-tongued Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Carilargo

    _Choeronycteris mexicana_ Tschudi, Fauna Peruana, p. 72, 1844,
       type from MA(C)xico.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 4: nos. 100078-100081, from 2 mi. W PAitzcuaro,
7,700 ft.

_Remarks._--A colony of 20 or more bats of this species was found in a
natural cave. Four were caught by hand as they flew about after we
disturbed them. We returned on the following day, but found that all
the bats had left.


=Leptonycteris nivalis nivalis= (Saussure)

Leaf-nosed Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago LengA1/4ilarga

    _M[=Ischnoglossa]. nivalis_ Saussure, Revue et Magasin de
       ZoA¶logie, 12(ser. 2):492, November, 1860, type from near snow
       line on Mount Orizaba.

    _Leptonycteris nivalis_, Miller, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       13:126, April 6, 1900.

_Range._--Probably middle and higher altitudes through state.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 91911, Univ. Michigan Mus. ZoA¶l., from
1050 m., 12 miles (on Huetamo Road) south of Tzitzio.

_Remarks._--The subspecific name _L. n. nivalis_ is tentatively
applied to this specimen in the absence of an opportunity to compare
it directly with the holotype or topotypes of _Leptonycteris nivalis
yerbabuenae_ Martinez and Villa (1940:291). Unfortunately, the
materials on which this name, _L. n. yerbabuenae_, was based all were
destroyed in 1945 or 1946 while Villa was absent from the Institute of
Biology of the University of MA(C)xico.


=Artibeus planirostris planirostris= (Spix)

Big Leaf-nosed Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Zapotero

    _Phyllostoma planirostre_ Spix, Simiarum et vespertilionum
       Brasiliensium, p. 66, 1823, type from suburbs of Bahia,
       Brazil.

    _Artibeus planirostris_, Dobson, Catal. Chiroptera, British
       Mus., p. 515 (part), 1878.

_Range._--Probably southwestern part of state.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 945b B. Villa R., field no., I.B., El
Guayabo, 34 kms. S Uruapan.

_Measurements._--Head and body, 89.0 mm.; total length of skull to
front of upper canines, 28.0; mastoid breadth, 15.5; zygomatic
breadth, 17.8; maxillary width across first upper molars, 13.2;
breadth across cingula of upper canines, 7.9; greatest length of one
ramus of lower jaw including anteriormost incisor tooth, 19.4; length
of upper tooth-row, anterior border of canine to posterior border of
M2, 10.4; length of lancet (nose-leaf), 9.0; width of lancet, 6.5;
width of horseshoe, 9.0; forearm, 57.3; 3rd metacarpal, 52.6; 1st
(basal) phalanx, 16.0; 2nd (middle) phalanx, 26.7; 3rd (distal)
phalanx, 18.5; 4th metacarpal, 50.7; 1st (basal) phalanx, 14; 2nd
phalanx, 18.8; 5th metacarpal, 54; 1st (basal) phalanx, 11.2; 2nd
phalanx, 13.2; lower leg, 22.9; foot with claws, 15.2; calcar, 6.5.

_Remarks._--Our single specimen, a female, was caught on July 28,
1945, by my (B. Villa's) father, Andres Villa, in a natural cave,
roosting with the individuals of _Glossophaga s. leachii_. The
northernmost locality in MA(C)xico from which _A. p. planirostris_
previously has been recorded is El Papayo, in the state of Guerrero
(Andersen, 1908:238), approximately 225 kilometers to the southward.
_A. p. planirostris_ and _Artibeus jamaicensis_ closely resemble each
other but _A. planirostris_ may be recognized by the presence of a
minute M3 which is absent in _A. jamaicensis_. Specimen no. 945b has
M3 present on both sides of the upper jaw. From _Artibeus hirsutus_,
known from La Salada, MichoacAin, approximately 40 miles north and
slightly to the east of El Guayabo, our specimen differs in the
apparently hairless tibia and interfemoral membrane. The measurements,
of no. 945b, recorded above, if compared with those given by Andersen
(1908:246) are seen mostly to fall within the range recorded for _A.
hirsutus_. Where measurements are outside this range, they fall within
the range of those of the larger _A. p. planirostris_. We recognize
that the Mexican species of _Artibeus_ are not well understood, at
least by us.


=Artibeus hirsutus= K. Andersen

Leaf-nosed Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Zapotero

    _Artibeus hirsutus_ K. Andersen, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist.,
       18(ser. 7):420, December, 1906, type from La Salada,
       MichoacAin.

_Range._--Known from western part of state.

_Remarks._--From MichoacAin, Andersen (1908:247) examined three
specimens, all from the type locality.


=Desmodus rotundus murinus= Wagner

Vampire Bat; Spanish, Vampiro

    _D[esmodus]. murinus_ Wagner, Schreber's SAugethiere, Suppl.,
       1:377, 1840, type from MA(C)xico.

    _Desmodus rotundus murinus_, Osgood, Field Mus. Nat. Hist.,
       publ. 155, zoA¶l. ser., 10:63, January 10, 1912.

_Range._--Statewide, except rare or absent at higher altitudes.

_Specimens examined_, 6: nos. 944-949 B. Villa R. field numbers, I.B.,
El Guayabo, 34 kms. S Uruapan.

_Remarks._--This species is colonial; usually it is found in large
numbers in favorite roosting sites, mainly in natural caves. Four of
our specimens, caught in July, are females and two are young males.
One, female, no. 944, has one embryo of 40 mm. in length.


=Myotis yumanensis lutosus= Miller and Allen

Yuma Myotis; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago de Yuma

    _Myotis yumanensis lutosus_ Miller and Allen, U. S. Nat. Mus.,
       Bull., 144:72, May 25, 1928, type from PAitzcuaro, MichoacAin.

    _Myotis yumanensis_, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:67, October
       16, 1897.

_Range._--Known only from PAitzcuaro and El Molino.

_Remarks._--Originally recorded by Miller (1897:67) from PAitzcuaro,
the animals from central MA(C)xico were named as a new subspecies by
Miller and Allen (1928:72) who record one specimen from El Molino.


=Myotis velifer velifer= (Allen)

Cave Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Vespertino

    _Vespertilio velifer_ J. A. Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.
       Hist., 3:177, December 10, 1890, type from Santa Cruz del
       Valle, Guadalajara, Jalisco.

    _Myotis velifer velifer_, Allen and Miller, U. S. Nat. Mus.
       Bull., 144:89, May 25, 1928.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 17: nos. 100083-100099, from 3 mi. NW PAitzcuaro,
6,700 ft.

_Remarks._--Our specimens were taken on March 12, 1943, from a crevice
in the wall of an abandoned chapel where 35 or more individuals of
both sexes were living. Miller (1897:59) records the species from
PAitzcuaro and Miller and Allen (1928:91) record it from there and also
from Lake Chapala, La Palma, AcAimbaro (now in Guanajuato) and
Negrete.


=Myotis thysanodes thysanodes= Miller

Fringed-tailed Myotis; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Colirugosa

    _Myotis thysanodes_ Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:80, October 16,
       1897, type from Old Fort Tejon, Kern County, California.

_Range._--Known only from PAitzcuaro.

_Remarks._--In the original description five specimens are recorded
from PAitzcuaro and Miller and Allen (1928:127) mention the same
locality of occurence.


=Myotis californicus mexicanus= (Saussure)

California Myotis; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago de California

    _V[espertilio]. mexicanus_ Saussure, Rev. et Mag. de ZoA¶l., 12
       (ser. 2):282, 1860, type from somewhere in the warmer part of
       the state of MA(C)xico.

    _Myotis californicus mexicanus_, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna,
       13:73, October 16, 1897.

_Range._--Known in MichoacAin only from PAitzcuaro.

_Remarks._--Specimens from PAitzcuaro are recorded by Miller and Allen
(1928:160).


=Eptesicus fuscus miradorensis= (H. Allen)

Big Brown Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Fusco

    _S[cotophilus]. miradorensis_ H. Allen, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.
       Philadelphia, p. 287, 1866, type from Mirador, Veracruz.

    _Eptesicus fuscus miradorensis_, Miller, N. Amer. Land Mamm.,
       1911, p. 62, December 31, 1912.

_Range._--Probably statewide.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 91909, Univ. Michigan, Mus. ZoA¶l., from
Rancho Escondido, one mile north of Apo, 6,000 feet elevation, June
29, 1947, female adult, taken by W. H. Burt.


=Lasiurus borealis mexicanus= (Saussure)

Red Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Rojizo

    _A[talapha]. mexicana_ Saussure, Rev. et Mag. de ZoA¶l.,
       13(2):97, March, 1861, type probably from Veracruz, Puebla
       or Oaxaca.

    _Lasiurus borealis mexicanus_, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:111,
       October 16, 1897.

_Range._--Probably larger part of state.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 89446, Univ. Michigan, Mus. ZoA¶l., from
Nuevo San Juan (Los Conejos), 5 mi. SW Uruapan, May 23, 1945, by W. H.
Burt.

_Remarks._--This specimen, a male with much worn teeth, answers well
to the description of _L. b. mexicanus_ except that the minute
premolar between the canine and fourth premolar is missing on each
side of the upper jaw. This, however, seems the less remarkable after
examination of 18 skulls of _L. b. borealis_ from the United States in
two of which these minute premolars are likewise absent; one of the
two specimens from the United States has unworn teeth and the other
much worn teeth.


=Lasiurus cinereus cinereus= (Beauvois)

Hoary Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Pardo

    _Vespertilio cinereus_ (misspelled _linereus_) Beauvois,
       Catal. RaisonnA(C) Mus. Peale, Philadelphia, p. 18, 1796,
       type locality, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

    _Lasiurus cinereus_, H. Allen, Monogr. N. Amer. Bats,
       Smithsonian Misc. Colls., 7(1): 12, June, 1864.

_Range._--Higher elevations throughout state.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 89456, Univ. Michigan Mus. ZoA¶l., from
Barranca Seca, May 6, 1945, adult male with much worn teeth, obtained
by W. H. Burt.


=Corynorhinus rafinesquii mexicanus= G. M. Allen

Long-eared Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Narigudo

    _Corynorhinus megalotis mexicanus_ Allen, G. M., Bull. Mus.
       Comp. ZoA¶l., 60:347, April, 1916, type from "near Pacheco,"
       Chihuahua.

    _Corynorhinus rafinesquii mexicanus_, Miller, U. S. Nat. Mus.,
       Bull., 128:83, April 29, 1924.

    _Corynorhinus macrotis pallescens_, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna,
       13:52, October 16, 1897.

_Range._--Known from only PAitzcuaro.

_Remarks._--Miller (1897:53) recorded one specimen from PAitzcuaro and
Allen (1916:349) merely alludes to Miller's record.


=Tadarida mexicana= (Saussure)

Mexican Free-tailed Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Coludo

    _Molossus mexicanus_ Saussure, Rev. et Mag. de ZoA¶l., 12:283,
       July, 1860, type from Cofre de Perote, 13,000 feet, Veracruz.

    _Tadarida mexicana_, Miller, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 128:86,
       April 29, 1924.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 12: nos. 100100-100111, distributed by
localities as follows: 1 mi. N Zamora, 5,450 ft., 1; 3 mi. N
PAitzcuaro, 6,800 ft., 3; 3 mi. NW PAitzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 3; Isla
Janitzio, Lago de PAitzcuaro, 6,600 ft., 5.

_Remarks._--This species is widespread in MA(C)xico, ranging from sea
level to high elevations as at the type locality. In MichoacAin most of
our specimens were shot as they flew about at early dusk. The five
from Isla Janitzio were shot as they clung to the roof of a cave along
with scores of other individuals of the same species.


=Eumops underwoodi underwoodi= Goodwin

Mastiff Bat; Spanish, MurciA(C)lago Mastin

    _Eumops underwoodi_ Goodwin, Amer. Mus. Novitates, 1075:2,
       June 27, 1940, type from El Pedrero, 6 km. N Chinaela,
       approximately 3,000 ft. elevation, Dept. La Paz, Honduras.

_Range._--Known only from TancA-taro Mtn.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 89461, Univ. Michigan Mus. ZoA¶l., from
Rancho Escondido, 2 mi. N Apo, TancA-taro Mtn., [F] ad. with much worn
teeth, taken June 11, 1945, by W. H. Burt.

_Remarks._--Selected measurements of this specimen are: Total length,
158; ear from notch, 32; mastoid breadth, 16.1; width across crowns
of M3, 12.6; maxillary tooth-row (from anterior face of canine above
cingulum to posterior face of M3), 11.8. The total length is less than
in _E. underwoodi_ or than in _Eumops sonoriensis_ Benson (1947:133);
the other measurements given above exceed those of _E. sonoriensis_
and equal or approach those of _E. underwoodi_. The ears seem not to
be connected across the forehead; the color is near (_l_) Bister above
and slightly lighter on the underparts.

The specimen is clearly intermediate in size, as it also is
geographically, between _Eumops underwoodi underwoodi_ Goodwin and
_Eumops underwoodi sonoriensis_ Benson and gives basis for arranging
these two named kinds as subspecies of a single species as Benson
(1947:134) suggested might prove to be necessary. We are not certain
whether this specimen should be referred to the subspecies
_underwoodi_ or _sonoriensis_ and probably this uncertainty will
remain until the range of individual variation in _underwoodi_ is
known.


=Procyon lotor hernandezii= Wagler

Raccoon; Spanish, Mapache; Tarascan, ApAitze (Apatz)

    _Pr[ocyon] hernandezii_ Wagler, Isis, 24:514, 1831, type from
       Valley of MA(C)xico, according to Nelson and Goldman (Proc.
       Biol. Soc. Washington, 44:17, February 21, 1931).

    _Procyon lotor hernandezii_, Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.
       Hist., 3:176, December 10, 1890.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 2: no. 100113 from 10 mi. ESE Zamora, 5,500 ft.,
1; no. 52220 from 15 kms. W Apatzingan, 1,040 ft., 1.

_Remarks._--In allusion to its habit of washing its food, in captivity
at least, before eating it, the Spanish speaking people often refer to
this species as _ositos labadores_. The specimen from 10 mi. ESE
Zamora is a skull without lower jaws or indication of sex. Because the
racoons damage corn in the roasting ear stage the animals are disliked
by the farmers, a score of whom sometimes band together in an
organized hunt to kill the animals. Dogs are especially trained to
hunt them. In MichoacAin no use is made of the pelts.


=Nasua narica molaris= Merriam

Coati; Spanish, Pizote; Tarascan, AmAitze (Amatz)

    _Nasua narica molaris_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       15:68, March 22, 1902, type from Manzanillo, Colima; Goldman,
       Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 55:79, June 25, 1942.

_Range._--Probably all but higher parts of state.

_Remarks._--We have no positive record of this animal which Goldman
(1942:79) writes "is widely distributed from Jalisco south through
Colima, MichoacAin, ... to southwestern Oaxaca." In the parts of
MichoacAin visited by us the Spanish name tejA cubedn instead of pizote was
used for this animal although in parts of MA(C)xico where the badger
(_Taxidea_) occurs, tejA cubedn is, we understand, the name used for the
badger.


=Bassariscus astutus consitus= Nelson and Goldman

Ring-tailed Cat; Spanish, Cacomixtle

    _Bassariscus astutus consitus_ Nelson and Goldman, Jour.
       Washington Acad. Sci., 22:487, October 19, 1932, type from
       La Salada, 40 mi. S Uruapan, MichoacAin.

_Range._--Probably greater part, or all, of state.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 100112 from 3 mi. NW PAitzcuaro, 6,700 ft.

_Remarks._--La Salada and three miles northwest of PAitzcuaro are the
two localities represented by actual specimens. A live animal, at
night, was seen one mile east and four miles south of TacAimbaro at
4,500 feet elevation. The young female from three miles northwest of
PAitzcuaro was trapped at a break in a stone fence.

Ring-tailed cats live in the stone walls, crevices and rocky ledges,
around corn fields and pasture lands.


=Mustela frenata leucoparia= (Merriam)

Weasel; Spanish, Comadreja; Tarascan, ApAisr or Apatzee (Apatz)

    _Putorius frenatus leucoparia_ Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 11:29,
       June 30, 1896, type from PAitzcuaro, MichoacAin.

    _Mustela frenata leucoparia_, Miller, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus.,
       79:100, December 31, 1912.

_Range._--Probably statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 6: in Biological Surveys Collection of U. S.
Nat. Mus., nos. 120304, 125972, 34914/47179, 36855/49239, and
34915/47180; 2014 B. Villa R., I.B., distributed as follows:
Zamora, 1; Los Reyes, 1; PAitzcuaro, 4.

_Remarks._--This subspecies of weasel is notable for having, among
American weasels of any kind, the maximum amount of white on the head.
When collecting at PAitzcuaro we saw no live specimens but were shown
several from there that had been recently mounted by P. Luna. He
regarded the animal as not especially rare.


=Spilogale angustifrons angustifrons= Howell

Spotted Skunk; Spanish, Zorrillo Manchado

    _Spilogale angustifrons_ Howell, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       15:242, December 16, 1902, type from Tlalpam, D. F.

_Range._--Probably all of state except low coastal area.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 100126, 3 mi. NW PAitzcuaro, 6,700 ft.

_Remarks._--The short tail of our specimen, an adult male, is
noteworthy as perhaps also is the breadth between the orbits.
External measurements are 338, 101, 39. It weighed 308 grams.
Selected cranial measurements are: Basilar length, 44.1; zygomatic
breadth, 32.4; postpalatal length, 26.6; least interorbital breadth,
13.8; height of cranium, 16.0. The specimen was trapped in a hole in a
stone fence. Howell (1906:23), under the name _Spilogale gracilis_,
recorded another male from PAitzcuaro.


=Mephitis macroura macroura= Lichtenstein

Hooded Skunk; Spanish, Zorrillo or Mofeta Rayada; Tarascan, Cuitziqui
(Kweetzeke)

    _Mephitis macroura_ Lichtenstein, Darstellung Neuer oder wenig
       bekannter SAugethiere pl. 46, 1832, type from mountains
       northwest of MA(C)xico City.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 12: nos. 100114-100125, distributed with
reference to PAitzcuaro, as follows: 3 mi. NW, 6,700 ft., 1; 2 mi. W,
7,600 and 7,000 ft., 2; 3-1/2 mi. S, 7,900 ft., 1; 4 mi. S, 7,800 ft.,
2; 5 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 5; 9 mi. SE, 8,000 ft., 1.

_Remarks._--Skunk tracks were abundant in all localities around
PAitzcuaro. Most of our specimens were caught in steel traps, some
along the edges of cornfields, others along the highway and along the
pole fences. Tarascan friends at Colonia RevoluciA cubedn were eager to have
the bodies of the skunks which we caught. They regarded the skunks as
a delicacy and told us that this food was reputed to be good for a
person's blood and complexion.


=Conepatus mesoleucus nelsoni= Goldman

Hog-nosed Skunk; Spanish, Zorillo Real

    _Conepatus mesoleucus nelsoni_ Goldman, Jour. Mamm., 3:41,
       February 8, 1922, type from ArmerA-a (near Manzanillo),
       Colima, 200 ft. altitude.

_Range._--Probably greater part, or all, of state.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 52217, TancA-taro, 6,000 ft.

_Remarks._--The name _C. m. nelsoni_ is tentatively used for the
single skin, which is without skull or indication of sex.


=Urocyon cinereoargenteus colimensis= Goldman

Gray Fox; Spanish, Zorra Gris; Tarascan, Cumihuaitz (Cumewatz)

    _Urocyon cinereoargenteus colimensis_ Goldman, Jour.
       Washington Acad. Sci., 28:495, November 15, 1938, type
       from 3 mi. W city of Colima, 1,700 ft. elevation.

_Range._--Statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 2: no. 100127, from 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S
TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft., and no. 51393 from Apatzingan.

_Remarks._--The female from southeast of TacAimbaro, caught on March
20, 1943, had two embryos, 28 mm. in length. This female was trapped
near a small stream. Goldman (1938:497) reported 7 specimens of _U. c.
colimensis_ from the following localities in the state: La Huacana, 1;
La Salada, 2; Los Reyes, 1; Mount TancA-taro, 1; PAitzcuaro, 2.

=Canis latrans cagottis= (Hamilton Smith)

Coyote; Spanish, Coyote; Tarascan, JihuAitz (Hewatz)

    _Lyciscus cagottis_ Hamilton Smith, Jardine's Naturalist's
       Library, Mamm., 9:164, 1839, type from RA-o FrA-o between
       city of MA(C)xico and Puebla.

    _Canis latrans cagottis_, Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       45:224, November 26, 1932.

_Range._--Probably most of state.

_Remarks._--On March 27 or 28, 1943, in Morelia, at a gasoline filling
station, one of us (Hall) saw a freshly killed coyote tied on the
bumper of the automobile of a Medical Doctor. In response to inquiry
about the animal the Doctor said that he killed it some 15 miles
northeast of town.


=Lynx rufus escuinapae= Allen

Bobcat; Spanish, Gato del Monte; Tarascan, MisA-cpAipu (misicpapu)

    _Lynx ruffus escuinapae_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
       19:614, November 14, 1903, type from Escuinapa, Sinaloa.

_Range._--Probably all of state above the Tropical Life-zone.

_Specimen examined_, 1: no. 47818 (U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv.
Coll.), PAitzcuaro.

_Remarks._--The skull of the male from PAitzcuaro agrees well with
those of topotypes of _L. r. escuinapae_ even to the elongate tympanic
bullae. Because of their elongation the bullae resemble, in some
degree, those of the ocelot. Natives told us that the gato del monte
was resident around PAitzcuaro. Four miles south of PAitzcuaro in a
cornfield at the edge of an area grown up to oak trees and brush,
tracks were seen that our Indian companion identified as those of the
gato del monte.


=Citellus variegatus variegatus= (Erxleben)

Rock Squirrel; Spanish, Ardilla de Pedregal; Tarascan, KuarAiki
(Kuaraki)

    _[Sciurus] variegatus_ Erxleben, Syst. Regni, Anim., 1:421,
       1777; type locality fixed as Valley of MA(C)xico near the city
       of MA(C)xico, by Nelson, Science, N. S., 8:898, December 23, 1898.

    _[Citellus] variegatus_, Elliot, Field Columb. Mus. Pub.,
       zoA¶l. ser. 4:148, 1904.

_Range._--Probably in all semi-arid, rocky habitats of the state.

_Specimens examined_, 11: nos. 100128-100135; 51385-51387, distributed
by localities as follows: 1 mi. N Zamora, 5,450 ft., 1; 3 mi. NW
PAitzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 5; 4 mi. S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 1-1/2 mi. S
TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; Mount TancA-taro, 1; Pedregal, TancA-taro, 1;
TancA-taro, 1.

_Remarks._--Rock squirrels were seen along rock fences, around
PAitzcuaro, where they are fairly common. On July 17 and 18, 1947, at
San Juan Parangaricutiro, one of us (Villa) saw these squirrels
running over the newly formed lava bed which was still emitting vapors
and which in places (between boulders) was emitting heat detectable by
the collectors. This is only additional evidence of the animal's
strong predilection for rocks, boulders and cliffs, which has earned
for it, in parts of the western United States, the vernacular name
"rock squirrel" and in MA(C)xico "_Ardilla de Pedregal_."

Howell (1938:138) reported specimens from the following localities:
AcAimbaro, 1; Los Reyes, 1; Mount TancA-taro, 2; PAitzcuaro, 12;
QuerA(C)ndaro, 1; Zamora, 2.


=Citellus adocetus adocetus= Merriam

Lesser Tropical Ground Squirrel; Spanish, Cuiniqui; Tarascan, KuarAiki
(Kuaraki)

    _Citellus adocetus_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       16:79, May 29, 1903, type from La Salada, 40 miles south
       of Uruapan, MichoacAin.

_Range._--Southern part of state in arid tropical land.

_Specimens examined_, 4: nos. 52000, 52001, 51388, 51389, distributed
by localities as follows: "Near TancA-taro," 2; Acahuato, 1;
Apatzingan, 1,040 ft., 1.

_Remarks._--Ground squirrels of this species are fairly abundant in
the arid tropical parts of the state. Their burrows are usually found
on stony areas along small ravines or under mesquite (_Prosopis
juliflora_) thickets. The name cuiniqui in use by the Spanish speaking
population is merely a corruption of the Tarascan name. Cuiniqui,
therefore, is a particular kind of _ardilla terrA-cola_ (ground
squirrel).


=Sciurus poliopus nemoralis= Nelson

MichoacAin Squirrel; Spanish, Ardilla arborA-cola; Tarascan, UakuA-
(Wakqe)

    _Sciurus albipes nemoralis_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc,
       Washington, 12:151, June 3, 1898, type from PAitzcuaro,
       MichoacAin.

    _Sciurus poliopus nemoralis_ Nelson, Proc. Washington Acad.
       Sci., 1:50, May 9, 1899.

_Range._--Pine and oak forests of most of state.

_Specimens examined_, 3: nos. 2102 and 2103 Louisiana State University
from 20 mi. E Morelia, 7,300 ft., and no. 1369 B. Villa R. from 1-1/2
km. N San Juan 2,250 meters.

_Remarks._--Tree squirrels of this kind have been reported by Nelson
(1899:51) from PAitzcuaro and Nahuatzin.

The young specimen, no. 2102, [M], has the tail slender, resembling
somewhat that of the _S. p. senex_ from the southward. The underparts
of the female are Warm Buff, more clearly so on the underside of the
legs.


=Sciurus poliopus senex= Nelson

MichoacAin Squirrel; Spanish, Ardilla ArborA-cola; Tarascan, UakuA-
(Wakqe)

    _Sciurus poliopus senex_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       17:148, October 6, 1904, type from La Salada, 40 mi. S
       Uruapan.

_Range._--Lowlands in southern part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 3: nos. 52004, 52014, 52015, distributed by
localities as follows: TancA-taro, 6,000 ft., 1; Apatzingan,
1,040 ft., 2.

_Remarks._--Specimen number 52014, [M], represents the melanistic
phase of this subspecies.

The upper parts of the hind legs in this specimen are slightly
grizzled. The upper side of the tail is vermiculated with whitish
and the underside of the tail is black.


=Thomomys umbrinus pullus= Hall and Villa

Southern Pocket Gopher; Spanish, Tuza Serrana; Tarascan,
Cumu (Como)

    _Thomomys umbrinus pullus_ Hall and Villa, Univ. Kansas Publ.,
       Mus. Nat. Hist., 1:251, July 26, 1948, type from 5 miles
       south PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., MichoacAin.

_Range._--Known only from pine-covered rolling land three to five
miles south of PAitzcuaro.

_Specimens examined_, 17: nos. 100136-100152, distributed by
localities as follows: 3 mi. S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 4 mi. S
PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 10; 5 mi. S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 6.

_Remarks._--Most of these pocket gophers were caught in areas
supporting a good growth of pine trees in the same places where the
much larger pocket gopher, _Cratogeomys gymnurus_, lived. Concerning
the individual designated as the type specimen, H. H. Hall (field
notes) writes that when he was making an excavation to reveal the
gopher's burrow (5 inches below the surface), he dug deeper than was
necessary and broke into the burrow of a _Cratogeomys_ directly below.
Another of us (E. R. Hall) had the same experience where the burrow of
a _Thomomys_ was approximately six inches below ground and that of a
_Cratogeomys_ approximately 16 inches below the surface of the ground.
At the time this arrangement led us to wonder if _Thomomys_ was in
some sense a "parasite" on the larger _Cratogeomys_ by levying on food
stores, if _Cratogeomys_ has any, but we found no evidence that such
was the case and from our subsequent trapping concluded that the
two-story arrangement was accidental and not the rule. The habit of
burrowing at different levels probably was one factor which permitted
the two kinds of pocket gophers to live in the same area. The average
weight of these gophers was 86 grams in males and 74 grams in females,
or only an eighth as much as in _Cratogeomys_.

_Range._--PAitzcuaro and TacAimbaro, as now known.

_Specimens examined_, 14: nos. 100153-100166, distributed by
localities as follows: 2 mi. W PAitzcuaro, 7,700 ft., 2; 3 mi. S
PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 4 mi. S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 5 mi. S.
PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 6; 9 mi. SE PAitzcuaro, 8,000 ft., 1; 1-3/4 mi. S
TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1-1/2 mi. S TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., 2.

_Remarks._--Burrows were common in cultivated fields and along the
roads and trails on the southern and southeastern side of Lake
PAitzcuaro. In the vicinity of TacAimbaro we noted burrows only in the
area between one and a half and two miles south of town where two
specimens were taken. As mentioned in the immediately preceding
account, the small _Thomomys umbrinus pullus_ and the large
_Cratogeomys_ were found in the same area. The color of our specimens
varies from Cinnamon-Brown through Prouts Brown and in some specimens
is Fuscous Black.

Hooper (1946:397) has shown that the genus _Platygeomys_ is not
generically distinct from the earlier named _Cratogeomys_. From
independent study of specimens not examined by Hooper we have
satisfied ourselves that he is correct in synonymizing _Platygeomys_
under _Cratogeomys_. Average and extreme weights of 4 of each sex from
2 to 5 miles south of PAitzcuaro are: [M], 683 (562-819); [F], 558
(438-707) grams.

_Range._--Known only from the type locality.

_Remarks._--Specimens from localities intermediate between Uruapan,
the type locality of _C. varius_, and the known localities of
occurence of _Cratogeomys gynmurus imparilis_ are much needed to
ascertain if _C. varius_ is specifically different from _C. g.
imparilis_, or merely subspecifically different.

vicinity of the type locality" (Goldman, 1938:211).

_Remarks._--As we drove an automobile from PAitzcuaro to TacAimbaro we
noted mounds made by pocket gophers along the road in the highest part
of the pass and supposed that these mounds were made by _Zygogeomys_
although we took no specimens of any kind of pocket gopher in the
pass.

_Remarks._--The upper parts of specimens available to us are rich
Seal-Brown and glossy. The chin, and in most specimens, the upper side
of the hind feet are white; the irregular white patch of the throat is
present only in two young females, numbers 51974 and 51978.

_Range._--Southern part of state in semitropical and tropical areas.

_Specimens examined_, 28: nos. 100185-100199, 52072-52084, distributed
by localities as follows: Apatzingan, 1,040 ft., 13; 1 mi. E and 2-1/2
mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,700 ft., 4; 4 mi. S and 1 mi. E TacAimbaro, 4,500
ft., 5; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft., 6.

_Remarks._--Most measurements show a sexual dimorphism in this
subspecies. Adult males are 15 per cent larger in external
measurements except that the foot is approximately the same. Cranial
measurements average approximately 5 per cent larger in males except
that the breadth of the rostrum and length of the maxillary tooth-row
are slightly less. South and east of TacAimbaro our specimens all were
taken in dry semitropical country, where bananas and sugar cane were
the principal crops grown. This subspecies has been recorded also from
La Huacana, MichoacAin, as well as from La Salada, the type locality,
by Goldman (1911:39).

_Remarks._--As explained in detail by Hall and Villa (1948:254) these
specimens from Zamora are intergrades between _L. i. jaliscensis_

_Range._--PAitzcuaro and vicinity.

_Specimens examined_, 16: nos. 100170-100184 and 50356 (U. S. N. M.),
distributed, with reference to PAitzcuaro, as follows: 3 mi. NW, 6,700

_Range._--Northeastern part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 5: nos. 50325-50329 (U. S. Nat. Mus.) from
QuerA(C)ndaro.

_Remarks._--The specimens from QuerA(C)ndaro are not typical of the
subspecies _L. i. alleni_ in that the shape of the interparietal bone
and width of the basisphenoid bone are almost exactly intermediate
between the conditions obtaining in typical _L. i. alleni_ and
topotypes of _L. i. acutus_.


=Reithrodontomys megalotis saturatus= Allen and Chapman

Western Harvest Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Orejudo

    _Reithrodontomys saturatus_ Allen and Chapman, Bull. Amer.
       Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:201, June 16, 1897, type from Las Vigas,
       Veracruz.

    _Reithrodontomys megalotis saturatus_, Howell, N. Amer. Fauna,
       36:36, June 5, 1914.

_Range._--Northeastern part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 12: nos. 100202-100212, 100273, from 1 mi. N
Zamora, 5,450 ft.

_Remarks._--Howell (1914:37) referred nine specimens from Nahuatzin to
this race and two from the same place to the subspecies _R. m.
zacatecae_. Our specimens from Zamora agree with topotypes of _R. m.
saturatus_ and with specimens of that subspecies from the Valley of
MA(C)xico in dark color and large size.

If our specimens of _Reithrodontomys megalotis_ are correctly
identified, subspecifically, _R. m. zacatecae_ ranges southward around
the western end of the geographic range of _R. m. saturatus_.

Where _R. megalotis_ and _R. fulvescens_ occur together, we find the
skull of the latter to be distinguishable by: a median spine on the
posterior border of the hard palate (truncate in _R. megalotis_); an
S-shaped instead of a C-shaped pattern on the worn occlusal face of
the last lower molar; and two re-entrant angles, on the lateral side
on the worn occlusal surface of the third upper molar, reaching
halfway across the tooth whereas in _R. megalotis_ the anterior
re-entrant angle is wanting or extends less than a third of the way
across the crown surface of the tooth.

    _Reithrodontomys megalotis zacatecae_ Merriam, Proc.
       Washington Acad. Sci., 3:557, November 29, 1901, type from
       Valparaiso Mountains, Zacatecas.

_Range._--From northwestern part of state south through its central
part.

_Specimens examined_, 53: nos. 100217-100269; distributed by
localities, with reference to PAitzcuaro, as follows: 3 mi. N,
6,700 ft., 3; 3 mi. N, 6,800 ft., 1; 3-1/2 mi. S, 7,900 ft., 3; 4 mi.
S, 7,800 ft., 31; 5 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 9; 9 mi. SE, 8,000 ft., 6.

_Remarks._--Howell (1914:40) has referred four specimens from PatambAin
to this subspecies, and our large series from the vicinity of
PAitzcuaro is also referred to _R. m. zacatecae_ because of small size
and reddish (less blackish) color. We lack typical specimens of _R. m.
zacatecae_ from the type locality for comparison and our knowledge of
_zacatecae_ is derived from Howell's (1914:39) description of it.

Average measurements of 5 adult males of _R. m. zacatecae_ from the
PAitzcuaro area showing much wear on the teeth compared with those of
five specimens from the Zamora area, of corresponding sex and age of
_R. m. saturatus_ reveal the smaller size of _R. m. zacatecae_. Total
length, 157, 166; length of tail, 84, 84; length of hind foot, 19.6,
20.1; length of ear from notch in flesh, 14.8, 14.0; basilar length,
16.2, 16.6; length of nasals, 8.3, 8.5; zygomatic breadth, 11.1, 11.5;
mastoid breadth, 9.9, 10.2; breadth of rostrum, 3.8, 4.0; interorbital
construction, 3.2, 3.1; alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 3.5,
3.5; length of rostrum, 7.7, 8.0.

    _Reithrodontomys tenuis_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
       12:15, March 4, 1899, type from Rosario, Sinaloa.

    _Reithrodontomys fulvescens tenuis_, Howell, N. Amer. Fauna,
       36:45, June 5, 1914.

_Range._--Western part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 27: nos. 100213-100216, 100274-100277,
100293-100311, distributed by localities as follows: 11 mi. W Zamora,
5,750 ft., 2; 6-1/2 mi. W Zamora, 5,950 ft., 2; 6 mi. W Zamora, 5,950
ft., 4; 1-1/2 mi. SSE TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., 2; 1-3/4 mi. S TacAimbaro,
5,700 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and 2-1/2 mi. S TacAimbaro, 7; 4 mi. S and 1 mi.
E TacAimbaro, 4,700 ft., 5; 1 mi. E and 5 mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft.,
1; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft., 3.

_Remarks._--Of the 19 specimens from the vicinity of TacAimbaro, only
two have the underparts reddish as does _R. f. inexspectatus_. The
upper parts are less reddish than in _R. f. inexspectatus_ but more
reddish and less blackish than in _R. f. toltecus_ from the valley of
MA(C)xico or than in _R. f. toltecus_ from Zamora. The external
measurements and cranial measurements are less than in _R. f.
toltecus_ or _R. f. inexspectatus_ and are as small as, or even
smaller than, those of _R. f. tenuis_ to the northward or than those
of _R. f. nelsoni_ to the westward. Relying only on printed
descriptions of _R. f. tenuis_ and _R. f. nelsoni_, we are inclined to
refer our specimens to _R. f. tenuis_ although the reddish color, we
suppose, is evidence of intergradation with _R. f. nelsoni_ and _R. f.
inexspectatus_.

The four skins from Zamora are gray, as opposed to reddish, both above
and below and in this respect they agree with the description of _R.
f. tenuis_. They are lighter-colored (grayer) than either _R. f.
toltecus_ or _R. f. inexspectatus_. The four specimens from Zamora are
larger than animals from the vicinity of TacAimbaro and average
slightly smaller than topotypes of _R. f. inexspectatus_.

By identifying our specimens as _R. f. inexspectatus_ and _R. f.
tenuis_, we are left without any specimens that we, ourselves, have
examined, which are referable to the subspecies _R. f. toltecus_. The
specimens from Los Reyes which Howell (1914:47) referred to _R. f.
toltecus_ have not been seen by us, and we guess, on the criteria used
by us, that the animals would be referable to _R. f. tenuis_. Because
Dr. Emmet T. Hooper has a revisionary study of the Mexican
_Reithrodontomys_ underway, we have not attempted to bring together
all of the pertinent material from different collections as would be
required for an ideally thorough analysis of the geographic variation
in _Reithrodontomys megalotis_ and _Reithrodontomys fulvescens_.

As illustrative of statements made concerning the average size of
_Reithrodontomys fulvescens_, the following measurements, all of
specimens with much wear on each of the molar teeth, are recorded.

=Reithrodontomys fulvescens inexspectatus= Elliot

Fulvous Harvest Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Moreno

    _Rhithrodontomys inexspectatus_ Elliot, Field Columb. Mus.

       MichoacAin.

    _Reithrodontomys fulvescens toltecus_, Howell, N. Amer. Fauna,
       36:51, June 5, 1914, part.

_Range_.--Central MichoacAin; limits of range unknown.

_Specimens examined_, 15: nos. 100278-100292, distributed by
localities as follows: 3 mi. N PAitzcuaro, 6,800 ft., 6; 3 mi. NW
PAitzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 3; 2 mi. W PAitzcuaro, 7,600 ft., 2; 2 mi. W
PAitzcuaro, 7,700 ft., 4.

_Remarks_.--Howell (1914:51) made _R. inexspectatus_ Elliot a synonym
of _R. f. toltecus_ and perhaps we should follow him in this. The
facts are that in our large series from the vicinity of PAitzcuaro, the
upper parts are more reddish than in _R. f. toltecus_ from the valley
of MA(C)xico, and more reddish than in _R. f. tenuis_ if we correctly
interpret Howell's (_op. cit._,:45) description of _R. f. tenuis_. In
the color of the underparts the series is, to us, indistinguishable
from topotypical _toltecus_ and therefore has more reddish underparts
than _R. f. tenuis_, as we know _R. f. tenuis_, from Howell's (_loc.
cit._) description. In size, the series from PAitzcuaro is intermediate
between _R. f. tenuis_ and _R. f. toltecus_ but nearer the latter.

_Range._--PatambAin, 1,200 feet elevation as now known.

_Remarks._--Howell (1914:68) lists nine specimens from PatambAin. We
have not examined these specimens. He listed at the same time seven of
the specimens from TancA-taro, but we have found specimens from
TancA-taro to be of another subspecies, _R. c. seclusus_. Accordingly,
we are in doubt as to whether the mice from PatambAin are subspecies
_chrysopsis_, _seclusus_, or an unnamed subspecies and our use here of
the name _Reithrodontomys chrysopsis chrysopsis_ for them is, of
course, provisional.

_Range._--Known only from Mount TancA-taro, from 6,000 feet elevation
up to at least 11,000 feet.

_Specimens examined_, 22: nos. 51407-51411, 52110-52126, all from
Mount TancA-taro, distributed by altitude as follows: 6,000 ft., 5;
7,800 ft., 10; 10,500 ft., 1; 11,000 ft., 1; no altitude recorded, 5.

_Remarks._--The 22 specimens in the Chicago Natural History Museum are
remarkably uniform in color in spite of differences in age; 17 are so
young as to have the first upper molar only slightly worn and 5 are
adults. In preparing the original description of _R. c. seclusus_,
known only from specimens in the summer pelage, comparison of color
was made with only the winter pelage of _R. c. chrysopsis_ and it was
pointed out that the differences noted in color between the two
subspecies might be seasonal rather than subspecific. A summer
specimen of _R. c. chrysopsis_ (K. U. 17980, taken on June 15, 12 km.
ESE Amecameca, 11,500 ft.), is available as the present account is
being written. In direct comparison with the original material of _R.
c. seclusus_, all in summer pelage, and in comparison with a specimen
of _R. c. chrysopsis_ in winter pelage (January 18), from 30 km. E
Amecameca, the summer pelage of no. 17980 is more blackish than the
winter pelage and therein more closely resembles that of _R. c.
seclusus_. The same is true of the more sparsely haired tail. The
ears, however, are blackish as in winter-taken _R. c. chrysopsis_.
This feature and also the large size and different cranial proportions
of specimen no. 17980 are in accordance with the differences between
_R. c. chrysopsis_ and _R. c. seclusus_ as recorded in the original
description of the latter.


=Baiomys taylori analogus= (Osgood)

Northern Pygmy Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Pigmeo NorteA+-o

    _Peromyscus taylori analogus_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:256,
       April 17, 1909, type from Zamora, MichoacAin.

    _Baiomys taylori analogus_, Miller, N. Amer. Land. Mamm.,
       1911, p. 137, December 31, 1912.

_Range._--Northwestern part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 35: nos. 100331-100365, distributed by
localities as follows: 8 mi. N Zamora, 5,500 ft., 2; 11 mi. W Zamora,
5,750 ft., 1; 6-1/2 mi. W Zamora, 5,950 ft., 2; 4 mi. W Zamora, 5,450
ft., 1; 3 mi. NW PAitzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 21; 3 mi. N PAitzcuaro, 6,800
ft., 5; 2 mi. W PAitzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 3.

_Remarks._--Osgood (1909:257) has recorded this subspecies also from
AcAimbaro and Los Reyes. We found that these animals got caught in our
traps almost as often in the daytime as at night and concluded that
they were less nocturnal, or at any rate more diurnal, than any of the
other cricetine mice at the places in MichoacAin where we trapped.


=Baiomys musculus musculus= (Merriam)

Tropical Pygmy Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Pigmeo Tropical

       April 13, 1907.

_Range._--Dry, tropical, southwestern parts of state.

_Specimens examined_, 41: nos. 100366-100406; distributed by
localities as follows: 1-3/4 mi. S TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1 mi. E
and 2-1/2 mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,700 ft., 11; 4 mi. S and 1 mi. E
TacAimbaro, 10; 1 mi. E and 5 mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft., 1; 6 mi. S
TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft., 4; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft., 14.

_Remarks._--Osgood (1909:258) has recorded this subspecies also from
La Huacana and La Salada. Three adult males with much worn teeth
weigh, in grams, 8.3, 9.3, and 10.8. Weights of three adult,
nonpregnant, females are 8.1, 9.4, and 9.7. None of our 13 females was
pregnant.


=Peromyscus maniculatus labecula= Elliot

Deermouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Cuatralvo

    _Peromyscus labecula_ Elliot, Field Columb. Mus., zoA¶l. ser.,
       3:143, February (March?), 1903, type from Ocotlan, Jalisco.

    _P[eromyscus]. s[onoriensis]. labecula_, Osgood, Proc. Biol.
       Soc. Washington, 17:57, March 21, 1904.

_Range._--Northwestern part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 59: nos. 51402-51406, 52175, 52176,
100407-100447, 100484; and 1366-1368, 1370-1372, 1374-1377, of
Bernardo Villa R., distributed by localities as follows: TancA-taro, 7;
11 mi. W Zamora, 5,750 ft., 3; 2 mi. W PAitzcuaro, 7,700 ft., 4; 3-1/2
mi. S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 2; 4 mi. S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 3; 5 mi.
S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 24; 9 mi. SE PAitzcuaro, 8,000 ft., 6; 1-1/2
km. N San Juan, 2,250 M., 3; 1 km. NNE San Juan, 2,250 M., 7.

_Remarks._--The zygomatic arches are less widely flaring in specimens
from TancA-taro than in those from PAitzcuaro.


=Peromyscus perfulvus= Osgood

Marsh Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn BreA+-ero

    _Peromyscus perfulvus_ Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 26:299, November
       14, 1945, type from 10 kilometers west of Apatzingan,
       1,040 ft., MichoacAin.

_Range._--Known only from the semitropical Life-zone in western
MichoacAin.

_Specimens examined_, 5: nos. 100593, 100595, 100597, 100598, and
100600, all from 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft.

_Remarks._--J. R. Alcorn took these specimens between fields of sugar
cane in tall (5 ft. high) grass growing in a belt 10 feet or so wide
along side a stream, which a person could step across. The one adult,
no. 100597, was recognized at the time of capture as different from
any other species known to us, by reason of the long, unicolored,
sparsely-haired tail and nearly clear Cinnamon Rufous color above,
white underparts, white feet, and dark brown ears. The four other
specimens in darker immature pelage are plumbeous and cinnamon whereas
immature individuals of comparable age of _Peromyscus banderanus_
caught in the same place are plumbeous above and lack the cinnamon
color. The immature animals of the two species differ in color more
than do the adults. Osgood (1945:300) has recorded eleven specimens
from the type locality. Our one adult weighs 52.4 grams.


=Peromyscus boylii evides= Osgood

Brush Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn de Chaparral

    _Peromyscus spicilegus evides_ Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc.

    _Peromyscus boylei evides_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:152,
       April 17, 1909.

_Range._--Northern part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 22: nos. 100450-100471, distributed by
localities as follows: 1-1/2 mi. SSE TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., 16; 1-3/4
mi S TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and 2-1/2 mi. S TacAimbaro, 4,700
ft., 5.

_Remarks._--Osgood (1909:153) recorded 31 specimens from Los Reyes.
Weights recorded by the collectors of our specimens for 13 males from
the vicinity of TacAimbaro, are 24.8 (17.2-37.1) and for 9 females 25.0
(20.0-31.5) grams. These weights include those of subadults as well as
those of adults.


=Peromyscus boylii levipes= Merriam

Brash Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn de Chaparral

    _Peromyscus levipes_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       12:123, April 30, 1898, type from Mount Malinche, Tlaxcala.

    _Peromyscus boylei levipes_, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:153,
       April 17, 1909.

_Range._--Probably central-eastern part of state.

_Remarks._--Osgood (1909:155) records one specimen of this subspecies
from PAitzcuaro.


=Peromyscus hylocetes= Merriam

Woods Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Ocotero

    _Peromyscus hylocetes_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       12:124, April 30, 1898, type from PAitzcuaro, 7,000 feet,
       MichoacAin; Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:159, pl. 3, fig. 8,
       April 17, 1909.

_Range._--Mountainous parts of state.

_Specimens examined_, 24: nos. 100472, 100542, both from 9 mi. SE
PAitzcuaro at 8,000 feet altitude; 1358-1365 of Bernardo Villa R., from
Cerro CuritzarAin, 3.5 km. NNW San Juan, 2,200 M.; 52178, 52185,
52187-52192, 52197, 52198, 52203, 52213-52215, from TancA-taro at
elevations of 6,000 to 10,000 ft.

_Remarks._--All of the specimens were taken in pine forest. The old
male from nine miles southeast of PAitzcuaro weighs 43.7 grams and the
younger male from there 35 grams. The adults from TancA-taro have
longer diastemae and some have the braincase more prolonged
posteriorly, than in specimens from the vicinities of San Juan and
PAitzcuaro but individual variation is considerable and we are unable
to differentiate some of the adults from TancA-taro from those from
elsewhere.

    _Peromyscus zelotes_ Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       17:67, March 21, 1904, type from QuerA(C)ndaro, MichoacAin.

    _Peromyscus truei gratus_, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:173,
       April 17, 1909.

_Range._--Northern part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 42: nos. 100448, 100473-100483, 100485-100509,
8700, 8702, 8703, 8896, 8897, distributed by localities as follows: 8
mi. N Zamora, 5,500 ft., 2; 11 mi. W Zamora, 5,750 ft., 11; 6-1/2 mi.
W Zamora, 5,950 ft., 4; 6 mi. W Zamora, 5,950 ft., 4; Rio Duaro, 9 mi.

_Remarks._--The ear measured from the notch is shortest, 19 (18-21),
at Zamora, intermediate, 21 (19-23), at PAitzcuaro, and longest, 21.8
(20-23), at the type locality of _gratus_ in the Valley of MA(C)xico.


=Peromyscus melanophrys zamorae= Osgood

Blackish Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Obscuro

    _Peromyscus melanophrys zamorae_ Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc.
       Washington, 17:65, March 21, 1904, type from Zamora,
       MichoacAin; N. Amer. Fauna, 28:187, April 17, 1909.

_Range._--Northern part of state.

_Remarks._--Insofar as we know, this mouse has been taken in MichoacAin
only at the type locality.


=Peromyscus banderanus banderanus= Allen

Tarascan Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Tarasco

    _Peromyscus banderanus_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
       9:51, March 15, 1897, type from Valle de Banderas, Nayarit;
       Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 26:300, November 14, 1945.

    _Peromyscus banderanus vicinior_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna,
       28:209, 210, April 17, 1909, part.

_Range._--Northern and eastern parts of state.

_Remarks._--Specimens from Los Reyes referred to the subspecies _P. b.
vicinior_ by Osgood (1909:209-210) were later characterized by Osgood
(1945:300) as agreeing with specimens from ZitAicuaro, and Osgood
(_loc. cit._) thought that those from both Los Reyes and ZitAicuaro
were not _P. b. vicinior_ but possibly _P. b. banderanus_. He had this
material set aside for further study when he showed it to one of us
(Hall) in 1945. It was his intention to revise the entire species (_P.
banderanus_) but so far we know never did this before his death.


=Peromyscus banderanus vicinior= Osgood

Tarascan Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Tarasco

    _Peromyscus banderanus vicinior_ Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc.
       Washington, 17:68, March 21, 1904, type from La Salada,
       MichoacAin.

_Range._--Hot valleys of western part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 53: nos. 100543-100592, 100594, 100596, 100599,
distributed by localities, from TacAimbaro, as follows: 2-1/2 mi. S and
1 mi. E, 4,700 ft., 21; 4 mi. S and 1 mi E, 4,500 ft., 10; 6 mi. S,
4,000 ft., 6; 6 mi. S and 1 mi. E, 4,000 ft., 16.

_Remarks._--There is much variation in size in our animals. The three
largest males weigh, in grams, 67.5, 50.3, 48.9 and corresponding
figures for the two heaviest, nonpregnant, females are 53.5 and 48.3
grams. Of the 14 adult females, only one was recorded as having
embryos; it had two embryos each 24 millimeters in crown to rump
length. Where we trapped among big boulders and among the roots of
trees of the genus _Ficus_, _Peromyscus banderanus vicinior_ was the
only species of the genus taken. _Peromyscus boylii evides_ occurred
in the less tropical vegetation, altitudinally and zonally above _P.
b. vicinior_.


=Peromyscus melanotis= Allen and Chapman

Black-eared Deermouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn MontaA+-ero

    _Peromyscus melanotis_ Allen and Chapman, Bull. Amer. Mus.
       Nat. Hist., 9:203, June 16, 1897, type from Las Vigas,
       8,000 ft., Veracruz.

_Range._--Higher mountains throughout state.

_Specimens examined_, 33: nos. 51397-51401, 52142-52166, 52172-52174,
from TancA-taro.

_Remarks._--The elevation recorded on the label of one specimen is
9,000 feet and on the labels of other specimens is no lower than
10,500 feet and on some is as high as 12,000 feet. The elevation of
capture is not recorded for two specimens. Osgood (1909:112)
previously recorded the species from 12,000 feet elevation on Mount
TancA-taro.


=Oryzomys couesi regillus= Goldman

Tropical Rice Rat; Spanish, Rata Arrocera Tropical; Tarascan word for
rat is JeyAiquihuiri (Hayakewire), or Sarisi

    _Oryzomys couesi regillus_ Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc.
       Washington, 28:129, June 29, 1915, type from Los Reyes,
       MichoacAin; Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:37, September 23, 1918.

_Range._--Plateau region of Northeast MichoacAin.

_Specimens examined_, 22: nos. 100601-100622, distributed by
localities as follows: 1 mi. N Zamora, 5,450 ft., 2; 4 mi. W Zamora,
5,450 ft., 1; 4 mi. S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S
TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft., 18.

_Remarks._--The tooth-row is longest in the specimens from Zamora,
shortest in those from TacAimbaro and intermediate in length in the one
specimen from PAitzcuaro. The shorter tooth-row at the lower elevation
(TacAimbaro), we interpret as intergradation with _Oryzomys couesi
mexicanus_. In color the specimens from TacAimbaro are, to us,
indistinguishable from those from Zamora and PAitzcuaro but the color
is notably darker than that of specimens from the vicinity of
Apatzingan which are here referred to the subspecies _Oryzomys couesi
mexicanus_. The largest male, fully adult from Zamora weighs 82.9
grams and the largest one from the vicinity of TacAimbaro weighs 73.6
grams.


=Oryzomys couesi mexicanus= Allen

Tropical Rice Rat; Spanish, Rata Arrocera Tropical

    _Oryzomys mexicanus_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:52,

       Tonila, Jalisco.

    _Oryzomys couesi mexicanus_, Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:33,
    September 23, 1918.

_Range._--Semitropical and tropical western part of the state.

_Specimens examined_, 14: nos. 52018-52023, 52063-52070, from 1,040
ft., 10 kms., W Apatzingan.

_Remarks._--These specimens are notably paler and have shorter
tooth-rows than those referred to _O. c. regillus_.


=Oryzomys fulvescens lenis= Goldman

Fulvous Rice Rat; Spanish, Rata Arrocera Pigmea

    _Oryzomys fulvescens lenis_ Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc.
       Washington, 28:130, June 29, 1915, type from Los Reyes,
       MichoacAin; N. Amer. Fauna, 43:91, September 23, 1918.

_Range._--Semitropical parts of state.

_Remarks._--The type and one topotype so far as we know are the only
specimens of this species to have been obtained from the state. The
size is hardly larger than that of a large _Reithrodontomys_.


=Sigmodon melanotis= Bailey

Fulvous Cotton Rat; Spanish, Rata Algodonera Leonada

    _Sigmodon melanotis_ Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       15:114, June 2, 1902, type from PAitzcuaro, 7,000 ft.,
       MichoacAin.

_Range._--Central MichoacAin, as now known.

_Specimens examined_, 8: nos. 100623-100626, 52089-52092, distributed
by localities as follows: 2 mi. W PAitzcuaro (7,400 and 7,700 ft.), 2;
3-1/2 mi. S PAitzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 2; TancA-taro, 6,000 ft., 4.

_Remarks._--This species was taken along with the species _S.
hispidus_ two miles west of PAitzcuaro, and can be easily distinguished
from the latter by the dark reddish as opposed to grayish color of the
upperparts and by the shorter hind foot (less instead of more than
32.5 mm.).


=Sigmodon hispidus mascotensis= Allen

Hispid Cotton Rat; Spanish, Rata Algodonera Setosa

    _Sigmodon mascotensis_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
       9:54, March 15, 1897, type from San SebastiAin, near Mascota,
       Jalisco.

    _Sigmodon hispidus mascotensis_, Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc.
       Washington, 15:108, June 2, 1902.

_Range._--Larger part of state.

_Specimens examined_, 4: nos. 100629, 3 mi. N PAitzcuaro, 6,700 ft.;
100630, 2 mi. W PAitzcuaro, 7,700 ft.; 100632, 1-3/4 mi. S TacAimbaro,
5,700 ft.; 100631, 6 mi. S and 1 mi. E TacAimbaro, 4,000 ft.

_Remarks._--Bailey (1902:109) records a "very large" specimen from
QuerA(C)ndaro. Our specimens have shorter molariform tooth-rows than do
those from nearer the type locality, for example, those from Tuxpan,
Las Canoas, and Artenkiki, all three places in Jalisco.


=Sigmodon hispidus atratus= Hall

Hispid Cotton Rat; Spanish, Rata Algodonera Setosa

    _Sigmodon hispidus atratus_ Hall, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
       62:149, August 23, 1949, type from 6-1/2 mi. W Zamora,
       5,950 ft., MichoacAin.

_Range._--Known only from Zamora and the type locality.

_Specimens examined_, 2: nos. 100628 (the holotype), 6-1/2 mi. W
Zamora, 5,950 ft.; 120268 (U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surveys Coll.),
Zamora.

_Remarks._--When the present account first was prepared our specimen
from six and a half miles west of Zamora was tentatively referred to
_S. h. mascotensis_. Subsequently a second specimen, from Zamora, was
found. It agreed with the specimen from six and a half miles west of
Zamora. Inasmuch as the second specimen agrees with the first and
since each of the two differs from any previously described kind, a
name and description were published in time to be inserted in the
present account. From _S. h. mascotensis_, _S. h. atratus_ differs in
shorter hind foot, darker upper parts, more densely haired tail,
shorter skull, more convex dorsal longitudinal outline of skull,
posteriorly constricted anterior palatine foramina instead of
parallel-sided foramina, and shorter and less decurved anterior
process of maxillary arm of zygoma.

runways. Bailey (1900:54-55) has recorded under the name _Microtus
mexicanus phaeus_ specimens from Nahuatzin which may be referable to
the subspecies _M. m. fundatus_.


=Mus musculus= subsp.?

House Mouse; Spanish, RatA cubedn Casero

    _Mus musculus_ Linnaeus, Systema Naturae, ed. 10, 1:62, 1758,
       type from Upsala, Sweden.

_Range._--Probably throughout state.

_Specimens examined_, 4: nos. 100696-100699, of which one is from
TacAimbaro, 5,700 ft., and 3 are from 4 mi. S and 1 mi. E TacAimbaro,
4,500 ft.

=Rattus rattus alexandrinus= (Geoffroy)

Black Rat; Spanish, Rata Negra

    _Mus alexandrinus_ Geoffroy, Catal. Mammif. du Mus. Nat.
       d'Hist., Paris, p. 192, 1803, type from Alexandria, Egypt.

_Specimens examined_, 3: nos. 52027, 52033 from TancA-taro and 8909 from
PAitzcuaro.

_Remarks._--These specimens answer well to the description of _R. r.
alexandrinus_ except that no. 8909, taken in May, 1901, by F. E. Lutz,
has yellowish underparts suggestive of _Rattus rattus frugivorous_. In
the town of TacAimbaro we saw a freshly killed rat of this species
which was all black.


=Sylvilagus floridanus subcinctus= (Miller)

Florida Cottontail; Spanish, Conejo de Florida

    _Lepus floridanus subcinctus_ Miller, Proc. Acad, Nat. Sci.
       Philadelphia, p. 386, October 5, 1899, type from Hacienda El
       Molino, Negrete, MichoacAin.

    _Sylvilagus floridanus subcinctus_, Lyon, Smiths. Misc. Coll.,
       45:336, June 15, 1904; Nelson, N. Amer. Fauna, 29:180, August
       31, 1909.

_Remarks._--Nelson (1909:181) records specimens from AcAimbaro,
QuerA(C)ndaro and the type locality.


=Sylvilagus floridanus restrictus= Nelson

Florida Cottontail; Spanish, Conejo de Florida

    _Sylvilagus floridanus restrictus_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc.

are favorite small game for the rural peoples.


=Sylvilagus cunicularis cunicularis= (Waterhouse)

Mexican Cottontail; Spanish, Conejo MA(C)xicano

    _Lepus cunicularis_ Waterhouse, Nat. Hist. Mammalia, 2:132,

    _Sylvilagus cunicularis_, Nelson, N. Amer. Fauna, 29:239,
       August 31, 1909.

_Range._--Probably all of state except tropical coastal areas where
another subspecies of the same species probably will be found to occur.

_Specimens examined_, 2: nos. 51965, 51966, from TancA-taro, one specimen
labeled as taken at 6,000 feet altitude.

_Remarks._--Nelson (1909:241) has recorded this rabbit also from
PAitzcuaro.


=Lepus callotis= Wagler

White-sided Jack Rabbit; Spanish, Liebre

    _Lepus callotis_ Wagler, Naturliches System der Amphibien, p.
       23, 1830, type from southern end of Mexican Tableland; Nelson,
       N. Amer. Fauna, 29:122, August 31, 1909.

_Range._--Approximately northeastern half of state.

_Remarks._--Nelson (1909:124) records specimens from Los Reyes and
QuerA(C)ndaro; we did not see any animals of this species in our own
field work.

(cucheramba) or JuAiteanapu (whatalanapu)

    _Tayassu angulatus humeralis_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc.
       Washington, 14:122, July 19, 1901, type from ArmerA-a, Colima.

_Range._--Approximately southwestern half of state.

_Remarks._--Under date of October 11, 1948, Henry W. Setzer (_in
litt._) states that four specimens of this species, in the Biological
Surveys Collection in the United States National Museum, were taken at
La Salada, by Nelson and Goldman, and bear catalogue numbers 126156,
126157, 126158 and 126159. No. 126158 is a female taken on March 19,
1903. The other three specimens are males taken on March 17, 1903. We
did not see any animals of this species in our own field work, and the
only materials from MichoacAin actually examined by one of us (Hall)
are the skulls of nos. 126156 and 126158, referred to above, from the
Biological Surveys Collection.


=Odocoileus virginianus sinaloae= Allen

White-tailed Deer; Spanish, Venado Cola Blanca; Tarascan, Asuni (Ashumi)

    _Odocoileus sinaloae_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
       19:613, November 14, 1903, type from. Esquinapa, Sinaloa.

_Range._--Probably statewide.

_Remarks._--Through the courtesy of Dr. A. Remington Kellogg we learn
that in a manuscript on the deer of the _Odocoileus virginianus_
group, he and the late Major E. A. Goldman had recorded specimens, in
the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National
Museum, as follows: Nahuatzin, 8,500 ft., nos. 35924/48232, and
35925/48233; Los Reyes, 5,000 ft., no. 165673; PAitzcuaro, 7,000 ft.,
no. 35535/47819; and Uruapan, 4,500 ft., no. 13060. We have not
anywhere seen the name combination _Odocoileus virginianus sinaloae_
but from the original description we judge that _Odocoileus sinaloae_
is to be arranged as a geographic race of the wide-ranging species
_Odocoileus virginianus_ as that species is now understood.


=Dasypus novemcinctus mexicanus= Peters

Nine-banded Armadillo; Spanish, Armadillo; Tarascan, IsA-ngu (Esinga)

    _Dasypus novemcinctus mexicanus_ Peters, Monatsber. k. preuss.
       Akad. Wissensch. Berlin, p. 180, 1864 (name restricted by
       Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna, 25:52, October 24, 1905, to the
       subspecies occurring at Colima).

_Range._--Probably statewide.

_Specimens examined_, 2; nos. 51392 from TancA-taro and 51964 from
Apatzingan, 1,040 ft.

_Remarks._--The female from TancA-taro is immature as indicated by the
wide-open sutures between the bones of the skull which in over-all
length is only 72.8 mm. The male from TancA-taro is older and the
over-all length of the skull is 98.33 mm. Geographic considerations
alone are responsible for our use of the subspecific name _mexicanus_;
we do not know the morphological features which distinguish
_mexicanus_ from other named subspecies.

_Text_ represents Italic and =Text= represents Bold.

On page 458, _Reithrodontomys fulvescens inexspectatus_ Elliot also
lists _Rhithrodontomys inexspectatus_ Elliot. Apparently the two genera
names (Reithrodontomys and Rhithrodontomys) are both 'correct' spellings
for Harvest Mice.

Numbers and fractional parts are displayed as follows: 1-3/4 = one and

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
