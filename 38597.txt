  _under the direction of_
  M. TERESA ARMITAGE
  _who writes as follows:_

  "Hiawatha's Childhood is an inspired little work and the best
  thus far composed for education purposes. In fact if is worthy of
  presentation as a curtain raiser in the leading Opera Houses. It is a
  fine piece of musical art, and entirely practicable for schools (Grammar
  and High Schools). The children love it, and the work, whether
  given with or without action, makes a delightful impression."

The Laurel Octavo Edition of Martha


is the outcome of extended and careful work, having for its aim
the presentation of a version of this opera which shall be adapted
primarily for use in schools.

It is suitable for performance in concert form as well as on the
stage with scenery and in costume.

Everything of value in the musical score has been retained in
the present edition. All dull and uninteresting numbers and tedious
unnecessary repetitions have been left out, while the valuable
music of the opera has been retained and the same has been
brought together into a harmonious whole.

The text has been revised and, where necessary, rewritten, and
is superior to the editions now current both in literary excellence
and in the valuable desideratum of "accents" and other adaptabilities
to musical utterance.

The Laurel Octavo Libretto of MARTHA supplies the dialogue,
stage directions and everything in which the copy for concert
purposes is lacking to make the Opera suitable for stage
representation.

Costumes may be obtained through the publishers.

Orchestration of this edition may be obtained from the publishers.

MARTHA




ACT ONE.


(LADY HARRIET, _maid of honor to the queen, has grown listless and
  pale, refusing to join in the court revels._ SIR TRISTAN, _an old
  knight, makes love to her; she will have nothing to say to him,
  and only asks to be let alone. She is tired of her conventional
  life, and longs for some new and strange adventure. The curtain
  rises on her richly furnished boudoir._ LADY HARRIET _is lying
  listlessly on a couch or arm chair, before her dressing table._
  NANCY _is putting finishing touches on her mistress' toilet. The
  ladies in attendance are grouped near the door in center._)


NO. 1.

  CHORUS.   Bright as are the stars of heaven,
            Sweet as any April flow'r,
            Gay of heart, of gentle bearing,
            Bless'd with beauty's radiant dower,
            Why so sad and pale with languor
            Grows thy face, O lovely maid?
            Why our friendly circle shunning,
            Dost thou sigh alone,
            As were some dawning joy delayed?
            Every splendid gift of fortune,
            All that riches can impart,
            Waits upon the maiden's pleasure,
            Nothing wins her heart.

(NANCY _takes a bouquet of flowers from one of the ladies and offers
  it to_ LADY H.)

  NANCY.    See these flowers Sir Tristan sent.

  LADY HARRIET (_pushing flowers away_).
            I've no heart for lovers' folly,
            Every pleasure is at end.

  CHO.      Bright as are the stars of heaven, etc.

  NANCY.    Every splendid gift of fortune, etc.

  LADY H.   Ah, there's naught can win my sad and weary heart.
            All your words are vain.

(_Ladies in waiting leave stage._)

(NANCY _holds hand mirror before_ LADY H.)


NO. 2.

  NAN.      Every heart with love inflaming,
            You the Queen's gay court adorn,
            Tho' from all a tribute claiming,
            Think not love alone to scorn.
            Pastimes for your pleasure framing,
            We all labor night and day,
            Sorrow still your soul is weighing,
            All your thoughts to sadness bend,
            If I fail in grief allaying,
            In its spring your life will end.

  LADY H.   On my heart 'tis preying, (_she sits up_)
            Love, wealth, fame, not weighing,
            In its spring time my life will end.
            There's naught that charm to life can lend.

(LADY H. _lies back languidly_.)

FOOTMAN (_enters, speaks_). Sir Tristan of Mickleford,
  Member of the House of Lords, Knight honored--

LADY H. (_interrupting_). We'll spare you the rest.

(_Enter_ SIR TRISTAN _with flowers. Bows to the ladies, presents
  flowers, which_ LADY H. _looks at carelessly and drops on table
  beside her. He is an elderly beau very precise in manner. A few of
  the ladies return, stealing on the stage to watch the scene,
  remaining at rear._)


NO. 3.

  TRISTAN (_sings_). Lovely cousin, I implore you,
            Hear my suit and do not chaff.
            I would say that I adore you--

  LADIES (_near door_). He's too civil, though, by half,
            He would make a mummy laugh.

(LADIES _leave stage again one by one_.)

  TRISTAN.  Dare I ask you--

  LADY H.   Don't be foolish.

  TRIS.     Dare I ask it you--O dear!
            Would you deign--disdain--an offer--

  LADY H.   For my hand--

  NANCY (_aside_). To box his ear!

(LADY H. _laughs aside with_ NAN.)

  LADY H.   Ah, Sir Tristan, he at least can make me smile!

  NAN.      Ah, Sir Tristan, he at least can make her smile.

  TRIS.     O, see already she is smiling,
            Happy omen, well I know,
            O, if mine could be this treasure,
            Happy man were I, that's so!

  LADY H.   Ah, he can all my woe beguile.
            What a funny old beau, Ah!
            A funny beau.

TRIS. (_speaks_). Fair Cousin, may I ah--dare hope that you--er--will
  so far condescend to me--uh--uh--as to go for a walk in the park?

LADY H (_indifferently_). Go fetch my fan!

TRIS. (_brings it._ LADY H. _fans violently_). Would it amuse you
  to--er--er--let us say--go out for a row on the river?

LADY H. (_ignoring him, glances round_). It seems very chilly here.
  Shut the window--there's a good man!

(TRISTAN _shuts it, trots back to her._)

TRIS. (_rubbing his hands_). Shall we go hunting, perhaps? It's a
  capital day for it.

LADY H. (_fans herself violently again_). O, how close it is!
  Air--give me air! Open the window.

TRIS. Why, I just closed it, at your command. (_Stands with
  hands spread out in comical dismay._)

LADY H. (_impatiently_). Open it, open it--don't you hear?
  Quick, air! (_very affectedly_).

(TRIS. _runs, trottingly, to open the window._)

NAN. (_aside_). My lord is running for the prize.

(_Here the song of the servants bound for Richmond fair is heard outside._)


NO. 3a.

  CHO. (_singing_). Hither come, linger not,
            Fate a home shall allot;
            She who works and not shirks,
            Finds her fun, when 'tis done.

  LADY H.   Hear them sing!

  CHO.      Hither come, take your pick,
            We will serve through thin and thick,
            Masters kind, come and bind,
            If we find you to our mind.

  NAN.      It's quite amusing!

  TRIS.     Nonsense! you must be mad.

  NAN.      You do not find them funny?

  TRIS.     Servants ignorant and bad.

  LADY H.   Ah, but they are gay and happy!

  NAN.      O, the bound girls, I now remember!
            This is Richmond market day.
            Where the servants, flocking yearly,
            Seek new masters, better pay.

  TRIS.     Stupid custom!

  NAN.      But 'tis an old one.

  LADY H. (_goes to window_). I might join them.
            What a thought!
            How I'd like to go among them,
            See such curious prizes bought!

  TRIS.     What a notion! What folly's this?

  LADY H.   Nancy, get the peasant costumes ready
            That we wore at the fancy dress ball.

(NANCY _is busy at chiffonier at one side. Tosses bright colored
  kerchief out._ LADY H. _picks it up and throws it over her head as
  the singing goes on._)

  TRIS.     You'd degrade yourself like this?

  LADY H.   Just amuse myself, that's all.
            Hurry Nancy, we must run,
            Now at last I'll have some fun!
            Martha (_curtseys_), Nancy (_curtseys_) and--old John!

(_Tosses her kerchief over_ TRISTAN'S _head, blinding him._ TRIS. _is
  bewildered, kerchief hanging over one eye._)

  TRIS.     Who is John? What old John?

  LADY H.   Who but you?
            You are old John!

  TRIS.     I? I old John?
            No that's too much.

(_Snatches off kerchief and throws it down._)

  LADY H.   Sir Tristan, whene'er the fair we woo, sir,
            With caprices we comply,
            Else we see tears fall in showers,
            See, dear John, these charming flowers--

(_Gives him flowers from his own nosegay. He kisses her hand, puts
  flowers in coat._)

  LADY H.   Take them, nor my prayer deny!
           (_lifts skirt at side and dances a step_).
            With the village people dancing,
            Nancy's partner you're enroll'd.

  TRIS.     No, in sooth I'm far too old.

  LADY H.   Stuff! In spite of years advancing,
            Man can do all, if he's bold.

  NAN. (_drags him about stage dancing_).
            This way, that way, loosely hopping,
            Each one jigging as he can,
            Lumb'ring, stumbling, never stopping,
            Mighty maze without a plan.

  TRIS.     Then, I must--

  LADY H.   I command it!

  TRIS.     But no, I can't.

  LADY H.   Your paces show!

  TRIS.     But my rank,--

  NAN.      How well you stand it!
            That's well I vow.

(_They all dance and the ladies sing la-la-la._)

  LADY H.   Danced superbly!

  NAN.      What a figure.

  TRIS.     I shall soon be out of breath.

  NAN.      Come, more vigor! come, more vigor!

  TRIS.     This I'm sure will be my death.

  LADY H. AND NAN.  Come, old John, come, old John,
            'Tis we who ask, so come along.

  TRIS.     This is too much! I, old John? What I?

(_All run off stage dancing_, TRISTAN _between the two ladies, who
  drag him._)

_Curtain._




ACT TWO.


(_Curtain rises on Richmond market place. Stall around sides of stage
  and back. In foreground, tables and benches; side show of some
  funny sort. Tents at one side. Country folk walking about,
  farmers and wives._)


NO. 4.

  CHO.      Come, O maidens fair,
            Yes, come, but come with cheerful looks!
            Handsome is as handsome does,
            The rule that suits our books.
            Hasten, hasten, cheerful maidens,
            Do not linger on the way,
            Soon the Hiring Fair will open
            And advancing is the day.
            Done! once the bargain is agreed to
            Neither can undo it.
            Done! faithful servants, kindly masters,
            Neither then will rue it.
            Neatness is the best of graces,
            Smooth of hair come every one;
            In a row all take your places,
            Soon the choosing will be done.
            If you'll be but quick and neat
            And try to do your best,
            You will find a happy home,
            And the pay of your deserving. Come!
            Find a home, yes, come.

(_Enter serving maids, arm in arm. Farmers go to meet them._)

  SERVANTS' CHO.  Hither come, linger not,
            Fate a home will allot, etc.

  FARMERS AND WIVES.  Come this way, don't delay,
            We have waited you many a day.

  SERV.     Oh, not now, but tomorrow,
            We are tired, we are shy.

  FARMERS.  Handsome is that handsome does,
            The best rule that ever was.

(_Farmers and wives try to bring servants into a line forward on
  stage. The servants hold back._)

  SERV.     Since the day how we have run,
            Now we shall know,
            Just where each girl is going to go.
            Now our journey's o'er and here we rest with you at last,
            After many a mile so long and lone is over past.

(_Servants scatter about stage, some lying down as if to rest, as_
  LIONEL _and_ PLUNKET _enter. They come on talking._ PLUNKET _is
  dressed as a peasant farmer and carries a whip. Lionel is dressed
  as a gentleman, but plainly._)

PLUNKET.  Here is a jolly howdoyoudo. What a clatter they make!
  The farmers are all going to engage servants for the coming year
  out of this crowd of chattering hussies. It is a good thing to
  take your time to choose, though, for once the bargain is made
  you have to stick to it for at least a year. What do you say,
  Lionel? Have you picked out your Betsy Ann?

LIONEL.  Betsy Ann--what do you mean? (_He speaks absently,
  slowly, and his demeanor throughout is one of dreamy abstraction.
  He is very grave and pensive, altogether a young man who would
  be likely to take a love affair very seriously and perhaps lose
  his mental balance temporarily over it._)

PLUN.  I mean our serving girl. You know mother put it in her will
  that we must keep up the farm together. So now like two good
  housewives we must fly around and choose a maid. Her name may
  be Sally or Katy or Jane, but I shall call her Betsy Ann!
  (_Laughs._)

LIO.  I shall always remember your dear mother and be grateful.

PLUN.  Yes, she was a good woman and a good mother, aye, a good
  manager, too. She knew how to make the maids attend to their
  work.

LIO.  But she was kind. She was always so kind to me.

PLUN.  Yes, she loved you. If you had been her own child she could
  not have tended you more anxiously. You were a mere baby when
  your father died and left you in our care. No one could help
  trying to make up your loss to you, somehow. If I'd a mind I
  might have been jealous of you. I was always the one who got
  the scoldings. I suppose mother owed them to me, for I was her
  own naughty boy!

LIO.  You have always been a real brother to me, Plunket. No
  helpless child could have had a happier fate than to find home
  with you.

PLUN.  You had no one but mother and me, old chap, don't you see?
  What else could a fellow do but try to keep you heartened up a
  little? (_Laughs with some embarrassment._)

LIO.  And yet even now we do not know who I really am. We shall
  never know, unless some day my father's ring (_lifts his hand_)
  may serve to clear up the mystery at last. (_Sings._)


NO. 5.

  LIO.      O'er my life from boyhood tender,
            You have watched with sheltering care,
            You your all would fain surrender,
            With the orphan child to share.
            You fulfilled a father's duty,
            When he left me to your love,
            Ah, he heard my mother calling,
            Heard her call from heaven above.

  PLUN.     Nor his rank nor name he told us,
            Nor the secret dar'd unseal (_touches_ LIONEL'S _hand_),
            This his ring one day shall tell it,
            All the mystery yet reveal.
            On your finger when he placed it,
            "This may change his fate," he sighed,
            "This my ring the Queen will honor
            Should misfortune e'er betide."

  LIO.      Brother mine, 'mid courtly splendors
            My vain longings ne'er shall rove,
            Ah, no light on earth allures me,
            Save the tender glow of love.
            No strange joys I'd earn for yonder,
            Peace and sweet content are here,
            'Mid the fields are simple pleasures,
            Calm affection, tried and dear.

(_A bell from the village church gives the signal for the fair to
  begin. Sheriff enters pompously, the farmers and wives and
  servants flock after him. He is dressed in wig, hat and robe.
  He has a staff of office. A girl is pushed against him in the
  crowd. He waves her back majestically, at arm's length and
  speaks._)

SHERIFF (_speaks_) Let the rabble stand back. Room for the majesty
  of the law. Ahem!

GIRL (_speaks pertly_). My, ain't he the big wig, though! (_Tweaks
  at his wig from behind and pulls it partly off. His hat falls
  off. She picks it up and runs._)

SHERIFF. Ouch! (_Grabs at wig with one hand and runs after the girl,
  shaking his staff at her. Another girl gets in his way; they
  dodge back and forth, till she puts her two hands, one each side
  of his face and tries to kiss him._)

GIRL (_speaks_). There, there, old gentleman, don't feel so bad
  over a bit of our fun!

(SHERIFF _ducks to avoid kiss and leaves wig in her hands_. _He runs
  wildly about stage, clutching alternately at his bald head, and
  at the wig, which the girls toss back and forth, while he tries
  to snatch it. Finally one of the farmers catches it and restores
  it to sheriff. He puts it on and some one brings him his hat._)

FARMER (_speaks_). Young hussies, you must do better than this when
  you get to working for us. Behave yourselves, now!

SHERIFF (_much distressed, almost weeping with rage_). I bind you all
  over to keep the peace on penalty of 10 shillings fine. (_Pounds
  with his staff._) Does the majesty of the law mean naught to ye?
  Silence (_they laugh_), you low bred populace. But what can one
  expect from populace? Pah! They are beneath my notice. (_Looks
  scornfully at them while music begins. A girl laughingly sticks
  out her tongue at him. He glares at her. She does it again. He
  looks hastily away and then back. She throws him a kiss, and all
  the rest follow suit. He scowls, but his face gradually softens
  into a smirk. The farmers drag the girls back into a line.
  Sheriff unrolls a parchment, that he takes from pocket of his
  big gown. He sings._)


NO. 6.

  SHERIFF.  We, Anne, Queen of England, greet ye!
            (_Snatches off his hat, farmers do the same._)
            Bonnets off, and mine likewise.
            I no ceremony spare!
            We hereby do recognize
            Ev'ry contract good and sound
            Made in Richmond market bound;
            Every lass who here is hired,
            Dating from this very day,
            Till the year is full expired,
            Must with her new master stay.
            If he pay the money down
            The bargain cannot be undone.
            Have you heard?

  CHO.      We know, sir, it is so, sir.

  SHER.     Now you stand up in a row.

(_Servants stand in line; he arranges them._)

            Tell us, Moll, what you can do.

(_One maid steps forward a little, bobs a curtsey._)

  1ST MAID. I can darn, sir, I can sew, sir,
            I can milk and I can mow, sir.
            I can bake and mend and make
            And garden beds I can weed and rake.

  1ST FARMER (_steps forward_). All for just four pounds a year.
            Well, at that she is not dear. (_Takes girl one side._)

  SHER. (_to next girl_).  Now, my lass, what can you do?

  2D MAID (_curtseys_).  I can mend, sir, sew a button,
            On old socks new feet can put on,
            I can roast and boil and stew,
            Can churn and chop and also brew.

  SHER.     Five pounds a year,
            'Tis for a song, now!

  2D FARMER (_steps up and leads her aside_).
            Here's my hand, done! Come along!

  Sher.     Come, it's your turn now to speak.

  3D MAID (_curtseys_).  I can clean, sir, I can scrub, sir,
            I'm a good one at a tub, sir,
            Yes, to every sort of work,
            My hand I turn and never shirk.

  SHER.     Kitty Bell and Johnny Snell,
            And Nelly Browne and Sally Towne.

  CHO. OF SERVANTS.  How to care for babes I know, sir,
            Bless 'em, I do love 'em so, sir,
            I can take the cows to graze, sir,
            And of poultry know the ways, sir;
            I can bake and boil and brew, sir,
            I can sew on buttons, too.

  MEN.      I'm accustomed pigs to keep, sir,
            Also, horses, cows and sheep, sir,
            Pork and beef in brine I steep, sir,
            Yes, and do the mowing cheap, sir;
            I can dig a garden bed
            And make a cabbage grow a head.
            Ha, if you pay the cash,
            We'll work just like a flash.
            Ho, it's very clear,
            All settled for a year.
            Ho, now the deed is done,
            We'll work like fun!

(_The servants flock around him as they sing and gather closer and
  closer till he puts his hands over his ears and tries to get away
  from them. They crowd around and sing into his face and over his
  shoulders._)

SHER. _(with hands at ears_).  Stop your cackling! You'll make me
  deaf!

FARMERS.  We are ready to choose, but one at a time, please.

(_Girls drop back into line; farmers move about among them_,
  LIONEL _and_ PLUNKET _also, as if bargaining with them_. _Enter_
  LADY HARRIET, NANCY _and_ TRISTAN _in peasant costume_.)

LADY H.  Come on, John! Courage man! Nobody's going to hurt you!

NAN.  Come, friend John! Don't look so scared. We'll take care of you!

TRIS.  John? O, im-pos-si-ble! O, pre-pos-ter-ous! I don't like this
  one bit. It is most unseemly. Yet--where beauty leads, love fain
  must follow.

LADY H.  How gay they all seem! They at least are happy.

TRIS.  I know I am not! I never felt less jolly before (_plaintively_)
  in all my life. (_Aside._) I feel as if I were going to cry.
  (_Face works._)

(PLUNKET _and_ LIONEL _approach the three and stand at a short
  distance, gazing at_ LADY H. _and_ NANCY.)

PLUN.  Jove! There's a brace of darlings!

LIO.  Yes, they are very pretty girls.

PLUN.  Rather slim built for hard work, though.

LIO.  They might do house work?

PLUN.  Yes, they might serve indoors. I don't know--(_pauses_)

TRIS.  See those clodhoppers! How they stare at you. O, do be
  persuaded to leave this horrid, horrid place.

LADY H. _and_ NAN (_together_).  No, indeed. We like it and we are
  going to stay.

TRIS.  I think those fellows are very suspicious looking characters.
  A pair of rogues. Let's go (_urging them by taking their arms_).

LADY H.  I'm not under your orders, sir. It is my pleasure to stay.
  I'll do exactly as I choose!

TRIS.  Well, I wash my hands of all responsibility. Don't say I
  didn't warn you.

NAN (_sees that_ PLUNKET _and_ LIONEL _are watching her_).  Those
  lads have an eye for a good thing, though. (_To_ TRISTAN.)
  We'll take all the blame. No one shall say that you led us
  into mischief, poor dear!

LADY H.  Yes, cousin, you are exonerated. Whatever happens, be it
  upon my own rash head. But I will not go! (_Emphatically._)

PLUN. (_overhears last words_).  You hear, sir? She will not go
  with you. Don't annoy the girls any further. (_To girls._)
  Call on us if he bothers you. (_To_ TRIS., _who looks daggers_.)
  But cheer up! There are plenty more maids yonder. Hi, girls
  (_turns to the servants_). Here's a chap wants a good maid,
  and he looks as if he could pay well, too.

TRIS.  Oh! what a beastly joke! He's taking liberties with me!
  (_He looks scared and affronted._)

(LADY H. _and_ NANCY _laugh together over_ TRISTAN'S _plight as the
  girls come forward and surround him_.)

ALL (_chattering_).  I can mow, I can sew, I can reap, I can sweep,
  I can bake and make, I can boil and stew, I can churn and
  brew! (_All speak different lines from the part just sung and
  make a great clatter and confusion._ TRISTAN _dodges among
  them and runs off, the girls following him_.)

LADY H.  He has taken refuge in flight!

NAN.  Let's hope he won't forget us.

LADY H. (_nervously_).  See those men. They are still looking at us.

NAN.  They seem to have taken a fancy to us, that's plain.

PLUN. (_to_ LIONEL).  One of them would be just what we want, I
  think--the younger one, now. (_Nods at_ NANCY.)

LIONEL.  It would never do to separate them. See how shy they are.

LADY H. (_to_ NANCY).  That one seems quite bashful, doesn't he?
  I wonder how such peasants talk?

NAN.  Bad grammar, for one thing.

PLUN. (_to_ LIONEL).  What are you afraid of? Go speak to them.

LIO.  I'm afraid to.

PLUN.  Silly noodle! Just watch me. (_Advances boldly as if to speak
  to the ladies, stops suddenly and goes back._)

NAN.  The big one is dumb, too; aren't they stupid! Let's go.

LADY H. (_turns to follow_ TRISTAN).  I suppose we'd better--
  (_Hesitates and looks back at the two men._)

PLUN.  We must not let such a chance slip. Servant girls like those
  are not found every day. I have taken a fancy to that big one
  and I don't mean to let her get away. Courage, Plunket! (_He
  advances again, again hesitates, and snapping his fingers at
  himself, advances and speaks._) Wait a moment, girls! We've
  decided we like you. If you're as smart as you look you can
  have a good place with us for years.

LIO.  Yes, for years and years!

LADY H.  You mean as your servants?

PLUN.  Of course! What else?

NAN. (_laughing_).  Ha! ha! ha! what a joke!

LIO.  What is there to laugh at?

PLUN.  So long as they do their work, the more they laugh, the
  better.

LADY H. _and_ NAN.  Work! We!

PLUN. (_to_ NAN.).  I'll give you the care of the geese and pigs and
  chickens. (_To_ LADY H.) You shall have charge of the
  garden--weed it, and gather potatoes and corn.

LIO.  O come! that's too hard for her. Let her do housework--

PLUN.  And darn our socks and mend our shirts? Very well. We'll
  pay you fifty crowns a year. For extras there'll be a pint of
  ale on Sundays and plum pudding on New Years.

LADY H.  Who could refuse such a tempting offer? (_Laughs._)

NAN.  Now I know what I am worth, at last! (_Laughs._)

PLUN. _and_ LIO. (_eagerly_).  You agree?

LADY H. _and_ NAN.  Yes! yes! We agree! (_They shake hands._)

PLUN.  It's a bargain! Here's the money down!

(LADY H. _and_ NAN. _each put the money in their purse, laughing
  together_.)


NO. 7.

  LADY H. _and_ NAN. (_sing_).

            See what grace they show in mien and bearing,
            Of our sport, I'm bound, I say, to see the end;
            Money's paid and we must keep our bargain,
            Men so courteous never will offend.

  LIO. _and_ PLUN.

            Two young maids so well set up and charming,
            Ne'er was city girl that equalled these of mine;
            They are jewels, pretty, kind and cheerful,
            Faith, I'll tell them so, and lose no time.

(_At close of quartette_ TRISTAN _comes back to stage, evidently
  exhausted and much dishevelled; the servants follow him and
  again surround him_.)

TRIS.  Oh, I thought I had eluded them! Leave off! Here's money!
  ( _Throws a purse._) Plague on your crazy pack! (_The girls run
  to divide the money._) Ho! what is this? (_He advances toward_
  PLUNKET, _who has hold of_ NANCY'S _arm_.) You forget yourself!
  Forbear!

PLUN.  Who are you? What do you want? (_A tussel threatens between
  the two men._ TRISTAN _backs down, afraid_.)

LADY H.  There, there! it's all right! (_To_ TRISTAN.) We are ready
  to go now. (_Takes his arm._)

PLUN.  I'd like to see you! With my money in your purse! You stay
  with us!

TRIS.  Fellow! do you know who this is?

LADY H. (_aside to_ TRIS.)  No! no! don't betray me! Think what a
  scandal if this got to court! Don't you dare to tell them who
  I am!

NAN. (_aside_).  We should be disgraced forever. Rather die than
  that!

TRIS.  Well, come, then. It is time for me to insist. I require you
  to come with me. (_Tries to lead them off._)

PLUN. (_interferes_).  Not so fast! You belong here. These are my
  maids, hired and cash paid in advance! Ask the sheriff!

SHERIFF (_who has approached during the altercation, after a long
  confab with one of the other girls at one side_). Have you taken
  the money?

LADY H. (_draws it out of her purse and flings it at_ LIONEL).  Yes.
  But there it is; I had forgotten it.

(LIONEL _picks it up and offers it back_. _She refuses it. He
  insists._)

SHERIFF.  You took it of your own free will and now it is a bargain.
  You are bound to serve for one year. Highty, tighty! Do you
  think you can play fast and loose with a master in that fashion?
  No, no! Bound you are to him and with him you must go!

(_During final chorus_ PLUN. _drives up his horse and cart and the
  two girls are handed into the cart_. _They drive away._ TRISTAN
  _tries to follow, but is restrained by the crowd. If the horse
  and cart cannot be had, the two girls may dodge about among the
  crowd, the men following them, and run off at last, the men
  chasing them_.)


NO. 7a. FINALE.

  CHORUS.

     Now our journey's o'er and here we rest with you at last,
     After many a mile so long and lone is over past.


(_Curtain._)




ACT THREE.


(_The third act opens in the great hall of the farmhouse of_ LIONEL
  _and_ PLUNKET. _At one side of stage at back is an outside door;
  on the other side, a window with bench in front of it. Another
  door is on the left. There are several chairs. A flight of stairs
  goes up from the right side, back corner. Two spinning wheels
  stand at rear, and farm tools hang about the walls._

_During the instrumental prelude the outside door opens and the two
  men_, LIONEL _and_ PLUNKET, _enter, inviting the girls_, LADY H.
  _and_ NANCY, _who are behind, to come in. They come in slowly,
  hesitatingly, half afraid._)


NO. 8.

  PLUN. _and_ LIO. (_sing_).
                        Come in, my pretty maidens,
                        We've reached our home, you see.

  LADY H. _and_ NAN.    O, we are in a pretty fix,
                        We only long to flee.
                        How safely to escape them
                        We'll seek from morn till mirk.

  (_Girls sit down_).   O, what a shabby dwelling,
                        O, how they'll make us work.

  LIO. _and_ PLUN.    Now, look alive!
                        Of work don't be afraid.

  LADY H. _and_ NAN.    There's no hope, I'm afraid.
                        We've come to the end of our jest at last.


NO. 9.

  PLUN. (_points to door at left_).

            That's the room I mean to give them.

  LADY H. _and_ NAN. (_rising_).
            Then good night, then good night.

(_Starting toward door._)

  PLUN.     What's that you say?
            First put everything aright.

  LADY H.   O, with cold I'm all a-shiver!

  NAN.      O, I quake in every member.

  LIO.      Both to fainting, seem inclined.

  PLUN.     Why, to spoil them you've a mind.

  NAN.      This denouement is provoking.

  PLUN.     You've not told us your names yet, my maids.

  LADY H. _and_ NAN.  We!

  LIO.      Yes, obey!

  PLUN.     Obey at once, no joking.

  LADY H.   Martha is my name.

  LIO.      Martha?

  LADY H. (_looks at him_).  Yes.

  PLUN.     Now, tell yours.

  NAN. (_aside_).  Mad masquerading!

  PLUN.     Don't you know it?

  NAN.      Betsy Ann!

  PLUN.     Betsy Ann? I rather like it!
            Come here, my girl: lend a hand then, will you, Betsy?

(_Pulls off his coat and offers it to her._)

            Take my coat and hang it up.

  NAN.      Do't yourself!

  PLUN.     You lazy hussy!

  LIO.      Come, you frighten her by scolding.
            Speak more gently, say like that--
            Martha, take away my hat.

(_Holds it toward her._ MARTHA _stamps her foot, slaps hat out of his
  hand and walks up stage_. _He, bewildered, hangs up his own hat._)

  LIO.      O, how have I offended? I cannot understand.
            Yes, I'm awfully perplexed.
            Why should she act so grand?

  PLUN.     Ah, what can be the matter?
            I do not understand.
            Some secret she is screening,
            Her manner is so grand.

  NAN.      Ah, on my dignity I stand.
            They give an order quite off hand!

  LADY H.   To tyranny I'll ne'er give in,
            We'll fight them now, to win.
            He thinks me strange and haughty
            But on my right I stand,
            Commanding I must withstand him,
            Resist his harsh demand.


NO. 10.

  PLUN. (_draws spinning wheels to center of stage_).
            Come, your task awaits, the whirring wheel and spindle!

  LADY H. _and_ NAN.  Set us spinning? We're to spin?

  LIO.      Yes, of course.

  PLUN.     So begin.
            How your claims to skill do dwindle.

  LADY H. and NAN.  Ha, ha, ha, spin, sir?

  PLUN. (_imitating her laughter in anger_).
            Ha, ha, ha, so set to work and spin your task!
            What you here for, may I ask?
            Just to hold your hands and chatter?
            What's the matter?

  NAN.      What a clatter.

  LIO.      Pray be calm, now, they're afraid.

  PLUN.     Peace! Come, spin! we won't be cheated.

  LADY H. _and_ NAN.  How, sir?

  LIO.      What?

  PLUN.     Come, come.

(_Places chairs at spinning wheels._)

  PLUN.     Be seated. (_They sit._)

  LADY H. _and_ NAN.  'Tis done.

  PLUN.     Good! Now then, proceed.

(_Imitating sound of spinning wheel._)

            Thrum, thrum, thrum.

  NAN.      I can't, indeed.

  LIO.      Here's the distaff, firmly grasp it (_To_ LADY H.),
            'Twixt your fingers seize the skein.

  LADY H.   Must we with wet fingers clasp it?
            Turn it? No, I won't!
            How so? In vain.
            I cannot, I cannot.
            Place yourself then at the wheel.

(_The two girls rise and the men sit one at each wheel._)

  PLUN.     We'll make it reel.

  ALL.      While the wheel is swiftly spinning
            Round it thus the flax is roll'd,
            But moistened just at the beginning,
            That more firmly it may hold.
            See the wheel so swiftly spinning,
            To thread the flax is thinning.

(NANCY _suddenly throws_ PLUNKET'S _wheel over and runs off stage
  by back door_, PLUNKET _after her_.)

(LADY H. _turns to follow_ NANCY. _Speaks._)

LADY H.  Nan--Betsy Ann! O stay with me! Heavens, she's left me!

LIO.  Martha, why are you going? Are you afraid to stay alone with me?

LADY H.  Afraid? Of you? Oh, no. (_Smiles, but still hesitates._)

LIO. (_aside_).  How could I ever have spoken harshly to her?

LADY H. (_aside_).  Where _has_ Nancy gone?

LIO.  Martha, I will never again ask any toil of you, or any service
  that you dislike. Martha, I never saw any one before that seemed
  to me so pretty and so sweet! Are all girls as lovely as you?

LADY H.  Don't you know?

LIO.  I never noticed a girl before.

LADY H. (_archly_).  Where have your eyes been?

LIO.  Dreaming, I guess. I feel as if I had just awakened to all the
  beauty and joy there is in the world!

LADY H.  Alas! and I feel as if I have already learned how shallow
  are all earthly joys! (_Pensively._)

LIO.  Poor little maid! You have had too hard a life. Such service
  has burdened you with care too soon. Here you will never again
  have to labor beyond your strength. I would myself do all
  disagreeable tasks rather than require them of you.

LADY H.  Oh, I am a good-for-nothing. I never did a real day's work
  in all my life.

LIO.  You must not scold yourself. Martha is my servant now, and I
  would not exchange her for a dozen others.

LADY H.  But can you not see that I am not worth my salt? I shall
  only be an expense to you. I cannot earn a shilling a week. See
  my hands. (_Shows them._) Do they look like useful members?

LIO. (_takes them in his hands_).  So white and soft! Surely never
  servant before had such pretty fingers. Not a spot of toil!

LADY H.  And so of course they are of no use to you, and you will
  not keep me here any longer. You will let them go--this useless
  pair of hands?

LIO.  I cannot let them go!

LADY H. (_tries to withdraw her hands_).  But if I work they will
  become hard and stained. I have never been taught--

LIO.  Never worked before? Then I will teach you and share your every
  task. What _can_ you do?

LADY H.  I can sing a little.

LIO.  And you can smile. (_He looks at her; her eyes fall._)

LADY H.  Sing and smile! A working maid must do something more than
  that.

LIO.  If you will stay with me here and smile and sing, you shall
  see how pleasant you will find it. You shall have no rough
  tasks. You shall have only kindness and happiness. You shall
  be like a sister in this house. These little hands will dispense
  blessing and peace. (_Kisses them._)

LADY H. (_draws her hands away and walks to the door. He follows._)
  Is it thus that masters treat a servant? (_With dignity._)

LIO.  Forgive me! I have forgotten everything. O, would that your
  station were different--or mine!

LADY H. (_turns back_).  My station?--(_recollects herself_). But I
  am only a serving lass! (_She laughs and returns down stage._)

LIO.  And so you must do what I bid you. I require of you a song.

LADY H.  Oh, I am too shy to sing.

LIO. (_takes the flowers from her dress_).  I'll exchange this nosegay
  for a song. (_Music of "Last Rose of Summer" may be played
  softly here._)

LADY H.  Ah! you jest.

LIO.  No, I command!

LADY H. (_coldly_).  Command, sir?

LIO.  Nay, I entreat (_kneels, laughingly_).

(LADY H. _takes one of the flowers he offers, and plays with it as
  she sings_. _He puts the other flowers presently into the breast
  of his coat._)

LADY H.  Ah, your entreaty I cannot withstand. (_Sings._)


NO. 11.

  LADY H. (_sings_).  'Tis the last rose of summer,
              Left blooming alone;
              All her lovely companions
              Are faded and gone.
              No flower of her kindred,
              No rosebud is nigh,
              To reflect back her blushes
              Or give sigh for sigh.
              I'll not leave thee, thou lone one,
              To pine on the stem,
              Since the lovely are faded,
              Go sleep thou with them.
              Thus kindly I'll scatter
              Thy leaves o'er the bed,
              Where thy mates of the garden
              Lie scentless and dead.

  (_Aside._)  His eyes betray he loves me,
              Spite my lowly seeming lot,
              My rank I must remember,
              Ah, would 'twere all forgot.
              His heart is true and loyal,
              Tie me her loves alone,
              O, would I were the lowly maid
              He longs to make his own.


  LIO.        All my proud rank forgetting
              For the maid I love alone,
              I'd lift her from her low estate,
              And make her all my own.

LIO. (_speaks_).  Martha!

LADY H.  Master!

LIO.   My heart can no longer be denied. I have loved you from
  the first moment I saw you yonder at Richmond market. Martha
  (_takes her hand again_).

LADY H.  Ah, no, no! (_Turns her face away._)

LIO.  Love at first sight! First love at first sight!

LADY H.  No more, no more! Oh, be silent!

LIO.  Martha, I shall never love woman but you. (_Puts his arm
  around her._)

LADY H. (_tries to escape_).  Oh, I must go, I must go! (_Pulls
  away._)

LIO.  Stay and hear me. Stay--and be my wife!--

LADY H.  Oh, what is he saying?

LIO.  See, I am at your feet--in earnest now! (_Kneels._)

LADY H. (_aside_).  Oh, how can I elude him? (_Begins to laugh._)
  Don't think me heartless, but really (_affectedly_) to see you
  kneeling there is so funny!

LIO.  But when we are married all difference of birth and station
  will be wiped out; you will forget that you were once my
  servant; you will have in me forever a slave!

LADY H. (_is touched, and then begins to laugh hysterically again_).
  Ha! ha! ha! This is ridiculous! If you only knew how funny you
  are!

(PLUNKET _runs on dragging_ NANCY. LIONEL _rises and_ LADY H.
  _runs toward_ NANCY _whom_ PLUNKET _swings on to the stage_.)

PLUN.  There, my girl! Don't you try that game again! Where do you
  suppose she was? the vixen! In the kitchen, smashing dishes,
  bottles, glasses, everything she could lay her hands on! She
  made me look lively, too, before I caught her. My eye!

NAN.  If you don't let me go, I'll scratch it out!

PLUN. (_releasing her_).  Jupiter! I believe you would! She has
  spirit. I confess I like to see it.

NAN.  Martha, Martha, what are we going to do? (_Twelve o'clock
  strikes slowly as they speak._)

PLUN.  Pooh! What ails you now? My patience is worn out! Get to bed,
  you idle baggage! You are a hard case, that's easy to see.

(_Quartet follows._)

LADY H., NAN., PLUN. _and_ LIO.  Midnight chimes sound afar!

  LIO.      If the maid her love refuse me,
            Yet I pledge my faithful heart,
            In her glance faint hope is smiling,
            Bringing comfort ere here we part.

  NAN.      Of our foolish prank I'm weary,
            Tho' in play 'twas fain begun;
            Yet our childish trick is working
            Pain and sorrow to every one.
            So good night!

  PLUN.     Now good night and sleep in quiet,
            Tho' you're fractious I am kind,
            Naughty girls to work must settle,
            Learn to mind.
            Now good night, good night.

  LADY H.   That to wound his heart I'm fated
            Fills my heart with pity and pain,
            Ah, our mad caprice is working
            Pain and sorrow, all in vain.

  LIO.      Though her love she refuse me,
            Yet I pledge my faithful heart,
            So good night, good night!

  retire after locking the outer door. Girls open their door again,
  peep out, run back, and shut door, etc.; then come out again,
  watching with finger on lips for interruptions. They speak._)

LADY H.  Nancy!

NANCY.  My lady.

LADY H.  This is our chance.

NANCY.  What shall we do?

LADY H.  What do _you_ say?

NAN.  Can we escape so--all alone?

LADY H.  We are locked in, besides.

NAN.  What an awful time we are having!

LADY H.  Awful day--aw-ful-ler night--the day was bad, but this is
  worse. We _are_ in a scrape!

NAN.  Still--those fellows might be worse! (_Looks at_ LADY H.
  _slyly_.)

LADY H. (_with dignity_).  They are well meaning.

NAN. (_archly_).  And polite.

LADY H.  If the Queen should hear of it!

NAN.  Good bye us!

(_A noise is heard outside at window._)

LADY H. (_grasps_ NANCY _and they run across stage to their door_).
  What is it? O who is coming?

NAN.  Steps--a voice--help is near!

TRISTAN (_outside whispers loudly_).  Cousin, cousin!

LADY H.  Tristan! O joy! O horrors!

NAN.  What will he think?

LADY H.  He will scold us--and we deserve it. But he will save us!

(TRISTAN _enters through the window which girls help him open_.)

TRIS.  Yes, here I am, faithful still. Cousin. (_Looks around._)
  What a vulgar habitation! That I should live to see you in a
  place like this. (_Shudders._)

NAN.  Hush! You'll wake everybody up.

LADY H.  Don't stop to preach. Just go.

TRIS.  I have a carriage at the corner. Come, make haste.

(_They tiptoe about and sing._)


NO. 12.

  LADY H. _and_ NAN.   Hasten then, to fortune trust our lot,
                       Fare thee well, thou humble cot.
                       'Tis our only chance to fly,
                       We'll not stop to say good bye.

  TRIS.                Let's be off now in a hurry,
                       For their anger we'll not worry,
                       'Tis your only chance to fly,
                       We'll not stop to say good bye.

  song, the men joining in chorus_.)


NO. 13.

  PLUN.     Come, can you tell me, read me the riddle,
            What to our lordly British name
            Gives power and fame--Come, say?
            Ha, 'tis old porter, brown and stout,
            None that is like it round about,
            The Briton's pride, he'll aye confide,
            In porter's power, whatever betide.

            Yes, hurrah, hurrah for old English ale,
            The friend in need who can never fail,
            Hurrah,--tra, la, la, la, la, la!

            Listen my lads and tell me truly
            What in our land you most do prize?
            What's worth your eyes? Come, say?
            Ho! 'tis your nut-brown foaming beer,
            See how it heaps the beaker here--
            The Briton's pride, he'll aye confide, in porter's power,
                  whatever betide.

CHO.  Yes, hurrah! hurrah for the old English ale, etc.

(_At close of chorus after_ PLUNKET'S _song, horns are heard
  outside,--the opening strains of the next number. When it stops,
  at end of second brace, he speaks._)

PLUN. Aha! the hunt is up. They told me the Queen would hunt today.

ONE OF MEN.  Yes, with all her ladies. No doubt the men-folk will
  follow, too!

PLUN.  Start along, you, then. I'll go in and pay the score.

(_Men leave stage_, PLUNKET _enters the inn_.)

(_As music begins again the court ladies run on in hunting costume.
  They wear short walking skirts, caps and high boots, perhaps, and
   all carry long spears._ NANCY _is with them_. _She carries a
   whip instead of a spear, and wears a long riding habit draped
   up over high boots._)


NO. 14.

  CHORUS.   All we ladies of the court
            Are lovers of sport of every sort;
            Every hunting cry we know,
            As hark tally ho, view tally ho!
            We can handle dart and bow,
            O yes, we can dart after a beau;
            We can shoot and ride and row,
            Can play at ball, dance at them all;
            With rings and things we prancing go,
            Ho ho! and tally ho! we know,
            And how to catch a beau!

(_Girls stroll about stage and sit at table._ NANCY _comes forward
  alone_.)


NO. 15.

  NAN. (_sings_).  Gay of heart, I have not known how to weep,
            How to be sorry and wan;
            Vigil to keep.
            Yet alas, sighs are my portion and pain,
            Tears that flow ever in vain,
            Hindering sleep.
            There's a voice speaks in my heart night and day,
            What is the word soft it would say?
            Ah, voice of love so true and deep,
            Ah, soul of faith my answer keep.
            Memory still calls one face to my heart,
            O light of my life forever thou art;
            O voice of love so true and deep,
            Face so dear, light of my heart
            Forever thou art.

(_She turns to the others who gather round her._)

  NAN.      Hunters fair, now beware,
            Lest you fall into a snare.
            Haste away, don't delay,
            Lest you lose your pretty prey.
            Love's a sprite soon takes flight,
            Chance and change are his delight;
            Use your eyes, win the prize,
            Ere too soon he flies.
            Love's a hunter, too, they say,
            Draws his bow, alackaday!
            Hit, we're fain to bear the pain,
            Flight is vain.

  CHORUS.   Yes, Cupid blind,
            Thy darts are swifter far than wind.

(_At end of chorus_ PLUNKET _re-enters from the inn_.)

PLUNKET.  Halloo! There seems to be good game afoot here. I'll see
  if I have any luck at the chase myself! (_Walks towards the
  ladies._)

NAN. (_looking around_).  Where can Lady Harriet be? She seems to
  avoid society more than ever. She is very unhappy, and has been
  so ever since--(_addresses_ PLUNKET) My good man, can you tell
  me--(_stops in agitation_)

PLUN.  What, Betsy Ann! You? In these togs!

NAN. (_distantly_). Well, my good man, what is it?

PLUN. I am not your good man! But you are my bad maid! Just you
  wait! I'll make you pay for all the trouble you've given me.
  What are you doing here in this masquerade?

NAN.  Are you crazy?

PLUN.  No use to pretend! I know you. Come along home with me!

NAN. (_shrieks as he seizes her wrist_).  Help! Help!

PLUN.  What a wicked little hussy you are!

NAN.  What an impudent big clodhopper you are!

(_The ladies turn back towards_ NANCY.)

NAN.  Here is game for you, girls. Let's see how he will like your
  spears!

(_Ladies surround_ PLUNKET _and threaten him_.)

CHORUS (_speaking all together_).  We'll give him a taste of our
  spear points! He won't bother her long! At him, now! There's
  safety in numbers! (_Repeating._)

PLUN.  Gently, gently--Hold on! This is turning the tables in good
  earnest. Ouch!!! Those remarks are a little too pointed for me.
  (_Dodges._) I never expected to see myself run from a woman, but
  here goes! (_He runs off, the ladies after him, shouting
  incoherently, as above._ NANCY _enters inn_.)

(_Enter_ LIONEL. _He looks more absent-minded and dreamy than ever.
  He seems dejected and ill. Murmurs to himself._)

LIO.  I will detach thee from thy frail trembling stem. O thou
  lovely rose of summer, thou shalt lie upon my heart, forever
  more! (_Takes withered flower from his breast and kisses it,
  then looks around him._)

Where am I? I feel that I am near her. Martha, Martha! thou
  star of my heart! I see her before me, with her beautiful pure
  smile, radiant in youth and sweetness. O Martha, I feel thee
  near! (_Sings._)


NO. 16.

  LIO.      O, when she rose fair on my sight,
            Radiant, lovely, like dawning light,
            Flow'd all my heart forth to her own,
            Tribute to beauty bright.
            Joy reviv'd and my thought
            Sang like woodlands after rain,
            Hope for me shone again,
            Lighting all my hours of pain.
            Gladness made all my heart
            Bright as meadows pearl'd with dew,
            For I dream'd love's sweet dream
            Ever old, yet young like dawn
            And ever new!

            O, when she rose, fair on my sight, etc.
            Martha, Martha, must I lose thee,
            Life has naught can peace restore!
            Thou, my comfort, peace and pleasure,
            Reft of thy sweet looks I die!

(_At the close of his song_ LIONEL _goes to the back of stage and
  stands alone_. SIR TRISTAN _and_ LADY HARRIET _enter_.)

TRIS.  The ladies are all out of sight. Why did you leave their
  company, fair cousin?

LADY H. (_pointedly_).  Because I wished to be alone!

TRISTAN.  To remain alone--with me?

LADY H.  With you?--(_laughs a little_) Alone or with you--it's
  quite the same thing!--I am low-spirited, that is what I mean.
  I don't want to see anybody.

TRIS.  What should make you so sad?

LADY H.  I am sure I know no more than you about it. It is a mystery
  even to myself.

TRIS.  But to remain alone in this secluded spot--is it quite--er--you
  know--

LADY H.  But it is exactly what I want. Good bye!

TRIS.  But I will soon return--soon--soon--(_looks back anxiously
  as he goes_)

LADY H.  Oh, it is so good to be alone, with only my sad memories
  for company! But if _he_ were only here--this loneliness were
  sweet.

LIO. (_wanders down stage and sees her_).  Ah! that voice!

LADY H.  Oh, heaven--what do I see?--

LIONEL.  A lady?--

LADY H.  He is here, then--even as I said!

LIO.  'Tis she--even as I said--Martha, Martha!

LADY H.  O, what shall I do now? How shall I elude him?--

LIO.  O, Martha, you have come back to me--O, thank heaven, thank
  heaven! It is Martha, her very self--Martha, who ran away from
  me!

LADY H.  O, how can I bear it! what a tragedy is this! To
  find--again--and to lose!

LIO.  Before mine eyes beheld thee, my heart recognized thee--

LADY H.  Recognized me? Surely you are mistaken, sir!

LIO.  No! Every line of your face is graven on my heart. I cannot
  be wrong. It is Martha's voice that I hear. There can be no
  mistake.

LADY H.  You are dreaming!

LIO.  If this be a dream, O let me never awake from it! Ah, I
  would dream thus forever. Disturb not so sweet a slumber!

LADY H.  O go, I beg you go!

LIO.  No, no. In my dream let me take your hand, as I did once--do
  you remember? Let me kiss it--thus--to tell my love.

LADY H.  I can no longer tolerate such gross impertinence. Will
  you go, sir?

LIO.  Wherefore this pretence? Why do you disown me?

LADY H.  Hence, peasant clown--begone!

LIO.  I, a peasant? I, your master? Patience is thrown away on you!
  I have been too gentle. Now I _command_ you to come instantly
  with me! (_Takes her arm._)

LADY H.  Tristan--help, help!

(TRISTAN _comes hurrying in, afterward followed by the others_.)

TRIS.  What has alarmed you? Speak!

LADY H.  Help me--save me from that fellow!

TRIS.  Who dares to--

LIO.  My lord, this is my servant, and I have a right to take her
  hence.

TRIS.  Listen to the brazen impudence of the fellow! It is really
  too horrid, don't you know? It fairly makes me shudder. The
  most unheard of audacity--Come here--all of you. (_Summoning
  the rest. They sing._)


NO. 17.

  CHO.      How audacious, rude and daring,
            To insult a lady so,
            'Tis a scandal past declaring,
            Off to jail the clown must go.

  LADY H.   Ah, 'tis agony and rapture,
            That he loves me is too true,
            I'm consenting to his capture,
            O my heart, what can I do?

  CHO.      Insolent beyond expression
            Thus upon our sports to break,
            For his terrible transgression
            Signal vengeance let us take.

  LIO.      Ah, 'tis agony and rapture,
            Thus once more her face to view,
            She's consenting to my capture,
            Break, then, heart, what else canst do?

(NANCY _enters from inn_.)

  NAN.      What's occur'd?

  LIO.      Betsy, too?

  PLUN.     Betsy, too.

  NAN.      Don't be afraid, my lady.

  LIO.      Lady? Now all is clear.
            All her charm, her kindly manner
            Were caprice and cruel sport
            To amuse a lady's leisure hour--
            O, just heaven, how harsh thou art.

  LADY H.   Pity for this fellow asking
            His free pardon let me crave;
            In his brain is madness masking,
            That is why his fancies rave.

  CHO. (_starting back_).  Madness? Madness?

  LIO.      O, what falseness!

  NAN.      O, poor creature!

  PLUN.     List, I pray.

  TRIS.     No, no, away.

TRIS. (_speaks_).   Arrest that madman!

PLUN. _and_ LIO.  Arrest him? Arrest me? (_He is seized._)

LADY H.  O, this is agony! (_Aside._)

NAN.  O, this is too hard! (_Aside._)

LIO.  But she agreed to it--she pledged herself.

LADY H. (_aside_ to LIONEL).  In the name of pity, be silent!

LIO.  She accepted the earnest money. She bound herself to serve me
  for a year.

CHO. (_laughing and chattering suddenly_).  How absurd! Ha! ha! ha!
  It really is too funny! (_Repeating._)

LADY H.  O, but let him be treated kindly. It is plain that the poor
  man is distraught. He is out of his senses. He does not know
  what he is saying.

LIO.  O cruel, O false!

NAN. (_aside_).  Poor fellow.

PLUN. (_to_ LIONEL).  A word with you.

TRIS.  Away, varlet! (_Trumpets are heard outside._) The Queen is
  approaching!

LIO.  The Queen! Ah! her coming brings me hope! (_Takes ring from his
  finger and gives it to_ PLUNKET.) This is the ring which my
  father left for me. He told you that if I ever should be in
  trouble this ring must be presented to the Queen. She will
  recognize it and will send me aid at once. Now is the hour
  which my father foresaw--O, unhappy day! Now is the hour to
  redeem the pledge he left with us, the pledge of his honor
  and mine. (_Turns to_ LADY H. _and gazes at her longingly_.)
  As for you, how shall I bear the memory of your treachery?
  (_Sings._)


NO. 18. FINALE.

  LIO.      Heav'n forgive this cruel scorning,
            All my anguish pardon you,
            You, my life's one best beloved,
            Teach me hearts can prove untrue.

  LADY H.   Heav'n forgive my faithless heart,
            Forgive my scorning,
            All his anguish pardon me.

  LIO.      Cruel girl, does it add to your joy
            To wound the heart that loves you well?
            My wild grief, my deep despairing,
            Must my love and madness tell.

  CHO.      Just rebuke of his offences,
            Shall not cause so much dismay.
            Off to prison let's despatch him,
            So our sport no longer delay.

  LADY H.   Ah, I wound a heart that loves me well.

(_Curtain falls as_ LIONEL _is led off under arrest, and_ LADY H.
  _steps into a sedan chair which has been brought on. Tableau._)




ACT FIVE.

(_Curtain rises on Richmond fair scene, set as before. The courtiers,
  all dressed as farmers and maid servants, are standing about._)


NO. 18a.

  CHO.      I can sew, sir, I can scrub, sir,
            I'm a good one at a tub, sir,
            Yes, to every sort of work
            My hand I turn and never shirk, etc. (_as before_).

(LADY HARRIET, NANCY _and_ PLUNKET _enter and come down front while
  chorus sings_. LIONEL _enters from the other side and wanders
  about among the booths, not looking at anything or anyone,
  wrapped in a deep reverie. He is plainly distraught, utterly
  unbalanced by the sad experience he has had._ LADY H. _and_
  NAN. _are in their hunting costumes_.)

PLUN.  Poor Lionel! He seems quite lost to me! He avoids me, seeks
  solitude, or if he does approach his fellow men he utterly
  ignores their presence, as now.

NANCY.  Does he seem to have no moments when he knows you?

PLUN.  Not so far. Ever since the Queen recognized the ring I gave
  her and restored him to his rightful place and name as Earl of
  Derby he seems to think he is no more himself. All the past is
  wiped away from his thought and he wanders about in a daze or
  dream.

LADY H.  And I am the one who is to blame!

PLUN.  Yes--and no. Nancy here did by me much what you did by Lionel,
  but it did not drive me crazy. So after all it is partly Lionel's
  strange nature that is to blame. He was always a queer lad,
  sensitive to a fault.

NAN.  Did you really think I meant the girls to stick their spears
  into you? I was furious with them!

LADY H.  It was my hope that if Lionel found himself again in the
  midst of this familiar scene where first we met he might
  recognize me and come to himself again.

NANCY.  But not when you are in those clothes. This is the costume you
  wore when you were so cruel to him.

LADY H.  That is true. I had forgotten, in my zeal to get all the
  rest of them ready. But here he comes. O, Lionel, don't you
  know me? (_He repulses her._)


NO. 19.

  LIO.      When I first that hand did claim,
            Was I not repulsed with laughter?
            Did that hand not heavy chains
            Heap upon me, heedless after?
            No, this hand which yesterday,
            But yesterday did drive me forth,
            Though today 'tis kind again
            Ah, to me 'tis nothing worth!

  LADY H.   O, he is cruel!

  LIO.      Love is turned to hate!
            I thought her sent by heav'n to bless,
            To shed around her happiness;
            What deep and glowing ecstasy
            Filled all my heart
            When first she smiled on me!

  LADY H.   Oh, can these eyes, grown dim with grief,
            And wan with tears, seek to betray you?
            Oh, doubt me not, for I am thine.

  LIO.      I ne'er again can call thee mine!
            Dead for aye my trust in thee
            Hateful art thou grown to me!

(LIONEL _rushes off the stage_. LADY H. _sinks weeping into the arms
  of_ NANCY.)

PLUN.  Courage, my lady! I see in this very frenzy a hopeful change.
  His apathy and indifference were far worse. At least you waked
  him up. Better luck next time.

NAN.  Go, my lady, and come back again in the simple little dress
  of Martha. When he sees you so it will call up the old memories
  and then--if you sing to him--surely his strange hallucination
  will not continue. (LADY H. _goes off_.)

PLUN.  Poor lass, my heart aches for her--or it would, if it were
  not so busy aching for itself.

NAN.  Yes, it is hardest of all for you--you have loved Lord Lionel
  so long.

PLUN.  To tell the truth I was not thinking wholly of Lionel, either!

NAN. (_demurely_).  You have troubles of your own?

PLUN.  You know very well what I mean!--I shall be so lonely when he
  leaves me to go and live on his grand estates.--Will you think
  of me sometimes, Miss Nancy, sitting all alone in my poor
  farmhouse?

NAN.  Ye-es, perhaps--I don't know. I shall think how you sit and
  si-i-igh--like that. (_Sighs in mock-serious fashion._) Ah-h-h!

PLUN.  You needn't laugh. It is a serious matter. I am very much
  to be pitied.

NAN.  If you could only--(_hesitates_)

PLUN.  What is she going to say now, the witch? (_Aside._)

NAN.  If you could--couldn't you get some one to come and live with
  you--a friend, perhaps--or even--a wife--now! Just let your
  imagination work a little.

PLUN.  That's so, I _might_ get somebody to marry me! That would
  be a good idea. I have a pretty neighbor--a farmer's daughter--

NAN.  O, indeed! A farmer's daughter? A good steady girl, I've no
  doubt, who would always do exactly what you told her. That's an
  excellent idea. Marry her by all means!

PLUN.  Will you dance at the wedding?

NAN.  Certainly--and who with a lighter heart? Remember to send me an
  invitation.

PLUN.  No, I won't, you little minx!

NAN.  Won't invite me?

PLUN.  Won't marry her.

NAN.  Why not?

PLUN.  I am not in love with her.

NAN.  But you will find plenty of other handsome lasses.

PLUN.  The more I search, the less I find.

NAN.  O, indeed. How unfortunate--for the girls!

PLUN.  None of them suit me. You see, I had a maid once--a little
  serving maid--the gayest, prettiest creature--but she ran away
  from me--

NAN.  Perhaps you were not kind to her?

PLUN.  Kind, I? I was kindness itself! I was _too_ kind! I _killed_
  her with kindness!

NAN.  Well, that's the trouble, then. A girl needs a good firm
  upstanding sort of a way, to keep her in her place. Don't be
  too easy,--take my advice. But tell me about your servant.

PLUN.  O, I don't know as she was so much, after all. But I found
  her amusing. She was a well-meaning sort of creature, and
  rather good looking, but she couldn't do a thing! She could
  not knit or spin, she could only laugh and joke.--But ignorant
  as she was, she knew one thing.

NAN.  What was that?

PLUN.  How to make me miss her!

NAN.  Perhaps she misses you!

PLUN. (_starts toward her_).  Nancy--my little Betsy Ann!

NAN.  And though she does not know the things you say, though she is
  a poor silly creature who never did a useful thing in all her
  life--could she not learn?

PLUN.  Don't torment me, girl. Do you mean what you say?

NAN. (_laughing at him_).  Certainly I mean it. What clever girl
  could not learn those things--if she really--

PLUN.  Really--what?--

NAN.  O, if it were worth while!

PLUN.  O Nancy, is it worth while?--But no, we must not think of
  ourselves while Lionel is in such a state--my poor Lionel!
  Until he is right again my home is his.

NAN. (_walking off a little stiffly_).  O, keep your old home! Nobody
  wants it!

PLUN. (_goes after her and speaks in her ear_).  I mean to keep
  it--and you!

NAN.  If you can!

PLUN.  I can. A voice whispers in my heart!

NAN.  What is the voice that whispers in your heart?

PLUN.  It is the voice of love.

(LADY H. _returns in peasant costume. She goes up to the groups of
  farmers and begins to arrange them in the old order. Speaks._)

LADY H.  Arrange everything just as it was before. Bring the big
  chair for the sheriff. Don't look at Lionel. Pretend to be all
  occupied with the business of the day.

NAN. (_looking off_).  Here he comes, with his sad and gentle look.
  Sing to him, my lady.

(_Music begins with_ NANCY'S _speech_. LADY H. _sings_.)


NO. 20.

  LADY H.   Now the April day returning
            Girds the earth with living green;
            As the moon shines clearer, fairer,
            Spring's new loveliness is seen.
            Laughing flowers that gem the meadows,
            With the stars in beauty vie,
            While the nightingale with singing,
            Tells his love to earth and sky.

  LIO.      Heaven! Martha's singing!

  LADY H. (_approaches him timidly_).  See, 'tis Martha.

  CHO.      See, he knows her! Sadly, but mildly
            Meets her glances
            And our advances.

(LIONEL _moves about among the supposed servants in wonderment_.)

(NANCY _steps from among them_.)

  NAN.      Now hither troop both young and old
            The village clock the hour has told!
            I can darn, sir, I can sew, sir,
            I can milk and I can mow, sir,
            I can bake and mend and make,
            And garden beds can hoe and rake.

  CHO.      Yes, I can clean, sir, I can scrub, sir,
            I'm a good one at the tub, sir (_etc., as before_).

  PLUN. (_to_ LIONEL).  Come, this way,
            We'll choose a servant;
            Come with me.

  LIO. (_passes his hand over his brow in bewilderment_).
            O, what is it?

  PLUN.     Why, the servants
            Who at Richmond market gather.
            Come, then, choose which one you'd rather.

(_They approach_ LADY HARRIET _and_ NANCY. LIONEL _stands and
  gazes at_ LADY H. _He speaks._)

LIO. (_perplexed_).  Martha, Martha! Is it you? Tell me that this
  is indeed you! Tell me that it is no dream. We are together
  at last!

LADY H.  Lionel, I am Martha, and your humble, loving servant. You
  know what has come to you, fortune and a splendid name. But
  before I knew of this, my heart repented. I was ready to go to
  you in your prison and claim you as my love. Then you were set
  free without my aid--O wretched, cruel girl that I was! Lionel,
  I am fairly punished for my worldly pride, my cruel impulse.
  But life is hard for girls. Think how they might all have scorned
  me if I confessed to having been a servant! But now I care for
  nothing--only you.

LIO.  Let all the past be forgotten. Joy smiles at last. At last
  my dreams have all come true.

PLUN. (_to_ NANCY).  And what can you do, you useless bit of baggage?

NANCY (_hums_).  I can cook, sir, I can bake, sir,--

PLUN. (_laughing_).  You are jesting. You are my own little
  good-for-nothing.

NAN.  If my master is obstinate--I can bring him to reason.

PLUN.  You will suit me, after all. You will make an excellent
  farmer's wife. Come along.

NAN.  There! (_She boxes his ear._) Take that as an earnest.

     LADY H. _sings_.


NO. 21. FINALE.

  LADY H.   Now the April days returning
            Gird the Spring in living green.

  LIO.      As the moon shines clearer, fairer,
            Spring's new loveliness is seen.

  LADY H. _and_ LIO.  While the nightingale with singing,
            Tells his love to earth and sky,
            Sounds at last love's hour of promise,
            Hour of hope and nuptial joy.

  CHO.      Sounds at last love's hour of promise,
            Hour of hope and nuptial joy.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
