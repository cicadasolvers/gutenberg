THE VAMPIRE CAT


SCENE. _At R. is a dressing table, upon it a steel mirror, toilet
articles, and two lighted candles with ornate shades. R. U. a section of
shoji leads to another room, this section is now closed. At R. C. a
large section of shoji is open, giving a view of the garden. To the R.
of this entrance is a small shrine and Buddha. At L. of the room is a
sleeping mat and head rest. By the head rest a lantern, now unlighted.
Down L. is an open section of shoji leading to the_ PRINCE'S
_apartments. Just above it stands a screen. As the curtain rises the_
PRINCE _is standing R. C. looking out into the garden._ RUITEN _is down
R. and_ BUZEN _slightly above him._ BUZEN _crosses L._


  PRINCE. [_Comes down between_ RUITEN _and_ BUZEN.]
  Settle for me tonight
  My sicknesses and my fears--
  [_To_ BUZEN.] Settle them for me,
  Sir Buzen, councillor crafty.
  [_To_ RUITEN.] Settle them for me,
  Priest Ruiten, the prayerful.

  RUITEN. So are we trying in all ways
  Thy pain to relieve
  Yet nought seems availing.

  PRINCE. Wracked is my body
  With tortures unending
  Born of the dreams
  That are surging forever
  Backward and forward
  Thru my brain, weary.

  BUZEN. [_Indicating door L._] Around thy bed each night
  Have I placed thy samurai
  In number one hundred
  To guard thy sleep--

  RUITEN. Zealously have I prayed
  In the temple called "Miyo In,"
  And during the night hours
  Have knelt at thy house shrine
  Praying to Buddha, the lord of the world.

  PRINCE. Yet have I not slept
  Entirely untortured.
  Slow are thy prayers
  In fruit bearing.

  RUITEN. Slow because contending with evil--
                [_Approaches Prince._]
  With evil in form strange and subtle.
  Over this house hangs a spirit
  Ne'er resting and ready always for dire deeds.

  PRINCE. Such a spirit there must be--but what?

  RUITEN. Evil takes many forms but the form of a cat
  Is favored by many devils.

  PRINCE. [_Startled, the others watch him closely._] A cat--aye, truly
  And if a cat stalked here
  That evil thing must we kill.

  RUITEN. Yet such is their power malignant
  That they take other forms than the forms of cats--
  Even human forms.

  PRINCE. Ha!--And the spirit that visits me?
  Mayhap that--
  Only twice hath it failed of its visit.

  BUZEN. And those lost visits, when?

  PRINCE. The last two nights.

  BUZEN. [_Swelling with pride._] Then, oh Prince, the cure may
    be found.
  Better than prayers is the cure [_Eyeing_ RUITEN.]
  For prayers have not ears--have not eyes--
  Have not weapons--better than prayers is it.

  PRINCE. Tell me this cure. It is grudged, Sir Priest?

  RUITEN. [_Bowing._] A cure for my lord could not be grudged.

  PRINCE. Well spoken. Say on, Sir Buzen.

  BUZEN. First I must beg clemency
  For thy hundred samurai
  For faithful they are to the bone, yet--

  PRINCE. Yet? Why clemency? For what?

  BUZEN. On guard, they slept.

  PRINCE. Slept?

  BUZEN. Aye. Soundly as though deep in saki.

  PRINCE. And none roused?

  BUZEN. They were as dead
  From shortly after the hour of ten
  Until dawning.
  Awakening they knew they had slept
  Yet knew not when the poppy was thrown in their eyes.
  Even as one man none knew
  And were deep amazed and full of shame.
  Each night it was the same.

  PRINCE. [_Angrily._] So, they slept.
  While I, on my couch,
  Through the hours writhed--
  Writhed and twisted--
  Weakening ever--
  Not sleep, yet dreaming--
  Oh, horrible dreams.

  RUITEN. Of what were these horrible dreams?
  What was their substance?

  PRINCE. [_Mystified at the memory._] There would come a soft
    stealing--
  As of draperies hushed and lifted
  For silence in walking;
  Like soft, silken draperies
  Wrapped about stealthy limbs.
  Then a shape clothed for sleep
  As women are clothed--
  Sinuous and vague in movement,
  Then taking form slowly--
  The form--a lie!--a lie! [_Covers his face and goes upstage._]

  RUITEN. The form?

  PRINCE. [_Turns._] O Toyo!

  RUITEN.
  BUZEN. [_Rubbing their hands._] Ah!

  PRINCE. [_Comes down R._, RUITEN _and_ BUZEN _are together a
    little L._]
  Came she to me--
  Leaned o'er me--
  Caressed me
  Yet soothed not.
  Her lips to mine--
  Her lips but not sweet.
  Then here on my throat
  Would she place them
  And all my life seemed to smother--
  Out of me flowed the life-blood
  In a deep stream
  Like a tide
  Forced by the gods,
  Against its will,
  To flow far away and yet farther.

  BUZEN. So does a vampire
  Sucking her victim
  Draw from him
  His blood and his marrow.

  PRINCE. Guard thy words!--
  As my strength ebbed
  She drew back
  Red-lipped and smiling,
  Smiling and laughing
  Though her laughter was silent.
  Then with a final shimmer
  Of silent silks she vanished--
  So was it done.

  RUITEN. So always the dream?
  If dream it were.

  PRINCE. The dream--I think yet it was a dream--
  So was it always.

  BUZEN. But the last two nights?

  PRINCE. Came she as usual
  Flowing over the floor
  Like a spectre enrobed
  And beautified.
  But as she bent o'er me
  She paused as if startled
  And, slowly gazing about,
  Turned and was gone.
  Last night she paused
  As if speaking to someone
  Though I could see no one.

  BUZEN. But the cause of her turning?

  RUITEN. Turned she startled--
  Turned she slowly--
  Turned she wonderingly?

  PRINCE. Slowly, as if she felt
  A strange presence.

  RUITEN. Feared she?

  PRINCE. She left me.

  BUZEN. But trembling or calm?

  PRINCE. Calmly, as from a thing hated
  And more powerful than she
  Whom she would not rouse to action.

  BUZEN. [_Rubbing his hands._] Good.

  PRINCE. What is good?

  BUZEN. That which thou speakest of.

  PRINCE. How so?

  BUZEN. [_Comes forward towards the Prince._] It proves that I have
    humbly succeeded--
  [_Grudgingly._] Through the help of another, 'tis true--
  But yet succeeded in bringing my lord honorable help.

  RUITEN. Indeed it is so.

  PRINCE. Say on, very wise councillor.

  BUZEN. [_Puffing up._] Without more words than are fit
  This then is the way of the cure.
  When long had thine illness ravaged and worn thee
  And many nights had you tossed by weird visions enthralled,
  No cures affecting, no prayers availing thee [_Glances at_ RUITEN.]
  Then councilled I with thy wise ones--
  And, too, with Priest Ruiten--

  RUITEN. I, you should name first,
  For without my prayers your wisdom was nought.

  BUZEN. To continue briefly.
  All our heads together brought no solution--

  PRINCE. True, true.

  BUZEN. [_Bowing._] Humbly I acknowledge my head
  Empty and brainless.
  Yet even from idiots lips
  Wisdom oft falls unexpected
  And therefore more wonderful.
  Now it is told in old tales
  Of how Iyaiyasu met--

  RUITEN. Short, abrupt is thy tale.

  PRINCE. The cure, Sir Buzen,
  The hour passes.

  BUZEN. [_Bowing._] I crave honorable leniency.
  To be brief--

  PRINCE. Aye, brief.

  BUZEN. Discouraged and sick at heart
  At the sufferings of my great lord,
  I was retiring to my room
  By way of the garden
  And the hour was the Hour of the Fox.
  I heard a splashing in the pool
  And drawing near
  Saw a young soldier washing.
  I spoke to him asking,
  "Who art thou?"
  "Retainer to my Lord Nabeshima,
  Prince of Hizen," he answered.
  Then talked I with him. Of thy sickness
  We talked. And he was ashamed of thy samurai's sleeping.
  He begged to be allowed to guard thy sleep
  Also for, being a common soldier, it was not permitted.
  So earnestly talked he that I promised to consult
  With the other councillors and see what could be done.
  "So tell me your name, young sir," I said.
  "Ito Soda is my name, honorable sir,
  And for your kind words I thank you."
  So I consulted and the result was
  We granted his request.

  PRINCE. And he, too, has watched the two nights past?

  RUITEN. Aye, and he slept not
  Though the samurai were heavy with sleep-fumes.

  BUZEN. I will tell.

  RUITEN. [_Elbows_ BUZEN _out of the way and comes forward._] You
    are honorably hoarse.
  He slept not, as I say--

  PRINCE. How kept he awake?
  Since many slept spell-bound
  How broke he the spell?

  RUITEN. With him he brought
  Oiled paper and laid it
  Down on the matting
  Sitting upon it.
  When o'er his eyes sleep stole
  And wearily weighted them
  He drew out his sharp dirk
  And in his thigh thrust it
  By pain driving the poppy fumes off.
  Ever and again he twisted
  The dirk in the raw wound
  And the thick blood-drops
  Soiled not the matting
  Because of the oiled paper.

  PRINCE. Indeed this is no common soldier,
  This Ito Soda.

  BUZEN. Indeed not--

  RUITEN. To continue--[_Retires upstage, disgruntled._]

  BUZEN. [_Pushing forward._] As I was saying, oh Prince,
  His eyes never closed.
  During the Reign of the Rat
  He heard, in this room, O Toyo
  Tossing and moaning
  As if in great fear of something
  She could not escape from.
  Even at the same moment
  As the beginnings of her moanings
  Came a cat-call from the garden--
  Then nearer--then ghostly paddings
  As of padded claws on matting,
  And an evil presence seemed hovering
  And lurking near in the darkness.
  O Toyo gave a low scream--than all was silence.
  Soon she came stealthily
  Through the shoji--cat-like her step--
  Glassy her eyes--
  Claw-like her hands--
  Bent she over you with curled lips--
  Then she turned, even as you have said,
  And, seeing a waking watcher,
  Left as she came.

  RUITEN. [_Comes down._] The second night of Ito Soda's watching
  She threatened him in low words
  But he made as to stab her
  And she melted before him
  Laughing a little.
  And he heard the rustle of her garments
  As she regained this room
  Though he saw not her passage hither.

  PRINCE. Thicker with each word the horror about me.
  [_Turns away to R._] Doubts to beliefs--beliefs to actions--
  Love unto hate. [_Turns to them almost pleadingly._]
  Tell me it is not O Toyo.

  BUZEN. I questioned her maid, Kashiku,
  And found that O Toyo's couch
  Was empty even at the time
  Of the weird visit to thee.

  PRINCE. [_Overwhelmed._] So, it was O Toyo!
  In the soul of a flower, a demon--
  On the sweet lips, poison.

  BUZEN. There is only one course--

  RUITEN. The one road--

  PRINCE. And I take it!

  BUZEN. [_Moves toward door L._] The samurai are gathered.

  PRINCE. Summon Ito Soda. [BUZEN _exits L._]

  RUITEN. Hard is the fate of man
  Here on this dark earth.
  Many the shapes and the shadows
  Stalking abroad.
  Yet ever the gentle Buddha
  From the Lotus Fields watches
  And guards every life that lives.

  PRINCE. [_Puts one hand on_ RUITEN'S _shoulder._] Priest, have
    not many
  Vampires bleeding them
  And dream it is another thing?

  RUITEN. The soul is often a vampire to the body.

  PRINCE. And that evil thing must we kill.

  ITO SODA. [_Enters L., kneels before the_ PRINCE. RUITEN _takes up
    R. a little and_ BUZEN _re-entering after_ ITO SODA _goes up C._]
  Honorable Prince, humbly I answer thy summons.

  PRINCE. Rise, Ito Soda.
  Faithful beyond words art thou,
  This know I as all hath been told me.
  No longer call thyself a common soldier
  But a samurai of the Prince of Hizen.
  And the two swords will I give thee on the morrow.

  ITO SODA. On my knees I humbly thank thee. [_Rises._]

  PRINCE. Now time presses.
  O Toyo will be coming
  In from the garden.
  As usual shall the hundred sleepy samurai
  Guard my couch. Let Ito Soda
  Remain here hidden and watchful.
  When O Toyo rises to enter my chamber--
  Your dirk is sharp, Ito Soda?

  ITO SODA. [_Draws dirk._] As a moonbeam on a cold night.

  PRINCE. And you know how to use it.

  ITO SODA. I will place this screen, thus. [_Goes to screen L.
    and opens it so as to form a hiding place between the sleeping
    mat and the door L._]
  So will I wait the moment.

  PRINCE. So be it. It is a good plan
  And on the one road. Let us about it. [_Exits L. followed
    by_ BUZEN _and_ RUITEN. ITO SODA _goes behind the screen._
    O TOYO _is heard singing in the garden._]

  O TOYO. [_Outside._] Moonlit convulvus
  Through the night hours
  Wan are their faces
  Ghostly sweet.

  Richer by daylight
  Drinking of sunshine
  As thirsty souls drink
  At a shrine.

  Fair are the faces
  Glassed in the quiet pools
  Maidens low-bending
  Vain ones.

  [_The singing stops abruptly._] Kashiku, is not that a cat
  Stealing stealthily there?
  She snarls--quick--[O TOYO _enters B. C. quickly and very
    frightened, turns and looks back, hurries_ KASHIKU _in._
    KASHIKU _follows much less disturbed at any fear of a cat
    than over her mistress' fright._]

  KASHIKU. [_Shuts the shoji R. C. and comes to_ O TOYO.] You are
    all atremble.

  O TOYO. Quick, let me be safe in slumber. [_Crosses to dressing
    table._]

  KASHIKU. [_Follows her and attends to her hair while_ O TOYO
    _kneels before the glass._] Several nights lately have I
    heard my lady moaning
  As though even in sleep were she troubled.
  The worry over your honorable lord hath disturbed thee.

  O TOYO. Your ears are over keen.
  I am happy when I sleep.
  How can I moan, being happy?
  You are dull.

  KASHIKU. Perhaps it was the wind or the echo of my lord's moaning.

  O TOYO. Moaning or was it singing?
  I would it were singing
  For singing is sweeter
  On the lips of those dying.

  KASHIKU. Dying?

  O TOYO. When those whom we love are passing--
  Even under our hands are passing--
  And our love weans them from life
  And our kisses suck out the blood-life,
  Then would we touch them no more,
  Then would we kiss them no more,
  But a power greater than we
  And a power that we fear
  Forces us on in our love-killing.

  KASHIKU. There is in your voice a vibration, as even the winds in
    the pine-tops
  When, in the autumn, they echo the summer's death-song;
  There is in your eyes a strange light as if the soul of another
  Looked out from your curtaining lashes and dimmed the sweet light
    there abiding.
  Oh, mistress, surely you are different than what you once were.

  O TOYO. [_Crosses C. slowly._] Even now comes the hour and the
    struggle
  And I do the bidding of that which is in me.
  How I hate the feel of his flesh
  Quivering under my lips
  And the loathsome taste of the blood-drops
  Thick on my lips that would soothe him and cannot.

  KASHIKU. Can anything soothe more than thy lips,
  More than the lips that love him?
  I cannot understand the words of your saying.
  You are happy and tearful all in a moment,
  Your soul seems a sky full of sunshine and clouds.
  [_Coming to her._] Even now as my hand touches you, you are
    trembling.
  Is it the cat that crept upon us
  Whose shape still affrights you?

  O TOYO. Thou hast said it--My soul is as thou sayest.
  My dreams are sweet and again bitter.
  Once came a dream horrible above all dreams.

  KASHIKU. What dream, my lady?

  O TOYO. The night when you found me there on the floor.
  Do you remember?

  KASHIKU. Well. You were all distraught and the bosom of your gown
  Was torn open and you clutched your throat
  As if you were wounded there. But there was no mark.
  And you let wild words fall from your lips
  And none knew their meaning.

  O TOYO. The Prince and I walked in the garden
  And there at the shoji I left him.
  As I entered
  There entered
  With me a spirit
  And its breath fell upon me--
  Dumb my tongue in my mouth
  And frozen my marrow.
  Suddenly it leapt upon me
  And as I fell downward
  Flashed the spirit into mine eyes--
  A cat, two-tailed and hairy--
  And it's teeth sank in my throat here--
  Can you see a mark? [_Exposes her throat to_ KASHIKU.]

  KASHIKU. The skin is as smooth as satin and perfect.

  O TOYO. Then came darkness upon me--and so you found me.
  So strong is the dream within me
  I wonder if it be a dream or no.

  KASHIKU. You had walked that evening in the garden.

  O TOYO. I had rather dreamed I walked--say I dreamed it.

  KASHIKU. The Prince was with--

  O TOYO. Yet it was a dream, question it not.
  I would go to rest peacefully.
  He, too, shall rest peacefully--
  I shall not kiss my lord tonight. [_Crosses L._]

  KASHIKU. Not kiss him?

  O TOYO. I think not I shall kiss him.
  I would not pain his slumbers--
  He has paled so and his face is so thin.
  In the night he lies like a strong flower
  And a strange flower, bled of its life--
  Like a strong flower weakened.
  And at its sight my dreams are bitter.
  But as I gaze a change comes over all things
  And I hold in my hands a beautiful flower
  Which I kiss with my lips
  Holding my lips long to it,
  Draining its sweetness.
  And a cloud passes over
  And on my lips are clots of blood!

  KASHIKU. Such dreamings are not good.
  I find the silken coverlets tossed in the morning,
  Twisted and thrown about as if you slept ill.

  O TOYO. It is not O Toyo who tosses them--
  It is the dream O Toyo.

  KASHIKU. Two nights lately have I imagined you called to me
  But entering you were not here--but there with your lord soothing
    his sufferings.

  O TOYO. Drinking at strange fountains and unknown springs--
  Drinking of sacred waters sacred to unknown gods.
  And as I drink another life becomes my life
  And he is mine--utterly mine, at last!

  KASHIKU. You frighten me--

  O TOYO. Be not frightened--you have no need.
  Now I shall sleep.
  He, too, is sleeping. Perhaps--perhaps he is suffering.
  Shall I touch him with my hands?
  Perhaps he is hungry for my kisses--
  Shall I kiss him?

  KASHIKU. It were a fitting thing to kiss thy lord.

  O TOYO. You know not what you say, Kashiku.

  KASHIKU. My lady--

  O TOYO. You have not heard me say strange things, Kashiku.

  KASHIKU. I have heard--

  O TOYO. Nothing.

  KASHIKU. Nothing, my lady.

  O TOYO. Put out the lamps. [KASHIKU _blows out candles on
    dressing table_.]
  Go now, Kashiku, and do you sleep deeply,
  Breathing poppies.

  KASHIKU. My lady--

  O TOYO. Go. [KASHIKU _opens shoji R. and goes out shutting it
    after her_. O TOYO _crosses, too, and lies on the sleeping
    mat. The room is almost in total darkness._]

  O TOYO. I shall kiss him--I shall kiss him! [_The lantern at
    the head of the sleeping mat glows more and more brightly
    until a cat's head appears on it. At this moment a cat-call
    comes from the garden._ (NOTE.--If these effects cannot be
    gotten with no hint of the ludicrous, have the lantern glow
    with increasing light but use no cat's head or cat call.)
    _With the increase of light_, O TOYO _has begun to moan and
    toss and at the moment of the cat-call she rises as in a
    trance and goes towards the door L. As she passes the screen_
    ITO SODA _steps out from behind it and plunges his dirk into
    her back; she falls with a little, stifled cry. Instantly, in
    utter darkness, the curtain falls._]

Hageman's Make-Up Book

  By MAURICE HAGEMAN
  Price, 25 cents


The importance of an effective make-up is becoming more apparent to the
professional actor every year, but hitherto there has been no book on
the subject describing the modern methods and at the same time covering
all branches of the art. This want has now been filled. Mr. Hageman has
had an experience of twenty years as actor and stage-manager, and his
well-known literary ability has enabled him to put the knowledge so
gained into shape to be of use to others. The book is an encyclopedia of
the art of making up. Every branch of the subject is exhaustively
treated, and few questions can be asked by professional or amateur that
cannot be answered by this admirable hand-book. It is not only the best
make-up book ever published, but it is not likely to be superseded by
any other. It is absolutely indispensable to every ambitious actor.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
