A FATHER OF WOMEN


                             AD SOROREM E. B.

    "_Thy father was transfused into thy blood_."

                                   _Dryden_: _Ode to Mrs. Anne Killigrew_.

         Our father works in us,
   The daughters of his manhood.  Not undone
   Is he, not wasted, though transmuted thus,
         And though he left no son.

         Therefore on him I cry
   To arm me: "For my delicate mind a casque,
   A breastplate for my heart, courage to die,
         Of thee, captain, I ask.

         "Nor strengthen only; press
   A finger on this violent blood and pale,
   Over this rash will let thy tenderness
         A while pause, and prevail.

         "And shepherd-father, thou
   Whose staff folded my thoughts before my birth,
   Control them now I am of earth, and now
         Thou art no more of earth.

         "O liberal, constant, dear!
   Crush in my nature the ungenerous art
   Of the inferior; set me high, and here,
         Here garner up thy heart."

         Like to him now are they,
   The million living fathers of the War--
   Mourning the crippled world, the bitter day--
         Whose striplings are no more.

         The crippled world!  Come then,
   Fathers of women with your honour in trust;
   Approve, accept, know them daughters of men,
         Now that your sons are dust.




LENGTH OF DAYS
TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE


         There is no length of days
   But yours, boys who were children once.  Of old
   The past beset you in your childish ways,
         With sense of Time untold!

         What have you then forgone?
   A history?  This you had.  Or memories?
   These, too, you had of your far-distant dawn.
         No further dawn seems his,

         The old man who shares with you,
   But has no more, no more.  Time's mystery
   Did once for him the most that it can do:
         He has had infancy.

         And all his dreams, and all
   His loves for mighty Nature, sweet and few,
   Are but the dwindling past he can recall
         Of what his childhood knew.

         He counts not any more
   His brief, his present years.  But O he knows
   How far apart the summers were of yore,
         How far apart the snows.

         Therefore be satisfied;
   Long life is in your treasury ere you fall;
   Yes, and first love, like Dante's.  O a bride
         For ever mystical!

         Irrevocable good,--
   You dead, and now about, so young, to die,--
   Your childhood was; there Space, there Multitude,
         There dwelt Antiquity.




NURSE EDITH CAVELL


Two o'clock, the morning of October 12th, 1915.

         To her accustomed eyes
   The midnight-morning brought not such a dread
   As thrills the chance-awakened head that lies
   In trivial sleep on the habitual bed.

         'Twas yet some hours ere light;
   And many, many, many a break of day
   Had she outwatched the dying; but this night
   Shortened her vigil was, briefer the way.

         By dial of the clock
   'Twas day in the dark above her lonely head.
   "This day thou shalt be with Me."  Ere the cock
   Announced that day she met the Immortal Dead.




SUMMER IN ENGLAND, 1914


   On London fell a clearer light;
      Caressing pencils of the sun
   Defined the distances, the white
      Houses transfigured one by one,
   The "long, unlovely street" impearled.
   O what a sky has walked the world!

   Most happy year!  And out of town
      The hay was prosperous, and the wheat;
   The silken harvest climbed the down;
      Moon after moon was heavenly-sweet
   Stroking the bread within the sheaves,
   Looking twixt apples and their leaves.

   And while this rose made round her cup,
      The armies died convulsed.  And when
   This chaste young silver sun went up
      Softly, a thousand shattered men,
   One wet corruption, heaped the plain,
   After a league-long throb of pain.

   Flower following tender flower; and birds,
      And berries; and benignant skies
   Made thrive the serried flocks and herds.--
      Yonder are men shot through the eyes.
               Love, hide thy face
   From man's unpardonable race.

                                  * * * * *

   Who said "No man hath greater love than this,
      To die to serve his friend?"
   So these have loved us all unto the end.
      Chide thou no more, O thou unsacrificed!
   The soldier dying dies upon a kiss,
      The very kiss of Christ.




TO TINTORETTO IN VENICE


_The Art of Painting had in the Primitive years looked with the light_,
_not towards it_.  _Before Tintoretto's date_, _however_, _many painters
practised shadows and lights_, _and turned more or less sunwards_; _but
he set the figure between himself and a full sun_.  _His work is to be
known in Venice by the splendid trick of an occluded sun and a shadow
thrown straight at the spectator_.

_Tintoretto's thronged_ "_Procession to Calvary_" _and his_
"_Crucifixion_," _incidentally named_, _are two of the greatest of his
multitude of works in Venice_.

         Master, thy enterprise,
   Magnificent, magnanimous, was well done,
   Which seized, the head of Art, and turned her eyes--
   The simpleton--and made her front the sun.

         Long had she sat content,
   Her young unlessoned back to a morning gay,
   To a solemn noon, to a cloudy firmament,
   And looked upon a world in gentle day.

         But thy imperial call
   Bade her to stand with thee and breast the light,
   And therefore face the shadows, mystical,
   Sombre, translucent, vestiges of night,

         Yet glories of the day.
   Eagle! we know thee by thy undaunted eyes
   Sky-ward, and by thy glooms; we blow thy way
   Ambiguous, and those halo-misted dyes.

         Thou Cloud, the bridegroom's friend
   (The bridegroom sun)!  Master, we know thy sign:
   A mystery of hues world-without-end;
   And hide-and-seek of gamesome and divine;

         Shade of the noble head
   Cast hitherward upon the noble breast;
   Human solemnities thrice hallowed;
   The haste to Calvary, the Cross at rest.

         Look sunward, Angel, then!
   Carry the fortress-heavens by that hand;
   Still be the interpreter of suns to men;
   And shadow us, O thou Tower! for thou shalt stand.




A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN


   A voice peals in this end of night
      A phrase of notes resembling stars,
   Single and spiritual notes of light.
      What call they at my window-bars?
         The South, the past, the day to be,
         An ancient infelicity.

   Darkling, deliberate, what sings
      This wonderful one, alone, at peace?
   What wilder things than song, what things
      Sweeter than youth, clearer than Greece,
         Dearer than Italy, untold
         Delight, and freshness centuries old?

   And first first-loves, a multitude,
      The exaltation of their pain;
   Ancestral childhood long renewed;
      And midnights of invisible rain;
         And gardens, gardens, night and day,
         Gardens and childhood all the way.

   What Middle Ages passionate,
      O passionless voice!  What distant bells
   Lodged in the hills, what palace state
      Illyrian!  For it speaks, it tells,
         Without desire, without dismay,
         Some morrow and some yesterday.

   All-natural things!  But more--Whence came
      This yet remoter mystery?
   How do these starry notes proclaim
      A graver still divinity?
         This hope, this sanctity of fear?
         _O innocent throat_!  _O human ear_!




THE TWO SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARIES:
OF BIRTH, 1864: OF DEATH, 1916.


                              TO SHAKESPEARE

         Longer than thine, than thine,
   Is now my time of life; and thus thy years
   Seem to be clasped and harboured within mine.
   O how ignoble this my clasp appears!

         Thy unprophetic birth,
   Thy darkling death: living I might have seen
   That cradle, marked those labours, closed that earth.
   O first, O last, O infinite between!

         Now that my life has shared
   Thy dedicated date, O mortal, twice,
   To what all-vain embrace shall be compared
   My lean enclosure of thy paradise?

         To ignorant arms that fold
   A poet to a foolish breast?  The Line,
   That is not, with the world within its hold?
   So, days with days, my days encompass thine.

         Child, Stripling, Man--the sod.
   Might I talk little language to thee, pore
   On thy last silence?  O thou city of God,
   My waste lies after thee, and lies before.




TO O--, OF HER DARK EYES


   Across what calm of tropic seas,
      'Neath alien clusters of the nights,
   Looked, in the past, such eyes as these?
      Long-quenched, relumed, ancestral lights!

   The generations fostered them;
      And steadfast Nature, secretwise--
   Thou seedling child of that old stem--
      Kindled anew thy dark-bright eyes.

   Was it a century or two
      This lovely darkness rose and set,
   Occluded by grey eyes and blue,
      And Nature feigning to forget?

   Some grandam gave a hint of it--
      So cherished was it in thy race,
   So fine a treasure to transmit
      In its perfection to thy face.

   Some father to some mother's breast
      Entrusted it, unknowing.  Time
   Implied, or made it manifest,
      Bequest of a forgotten clime.

   Hereditary eyes!  But this
      Is single, singular, apart:--
   New-made thy love, new-made thy kiss,
      New-made thy errand to my heart.




THE TREASURE


         Three times have I beheld
   Fear leap in a babe's face, and take his breath,
         Fear, like the fear of eld
   That knows the price of life, the name of death.

         What is it justifies
   This thing, this dread, this fright that has no tongue,
         The terror in those eyes
   When only eyes can speak--they are so young?

         Not yet those eyes had wept.
   What does fear cherish that it locks so well?
         What fortress is thus kept?
   Of what is ignorant terror sentinel?

         And pain in the poor child,
   Monstrously disproportionate, and dumb
         In the poor beast, and wild
   In the old decorous man, caught, overcome?

         Of what the outposts these?
   Of what the fighting guardians?  What demands
         That sense of menaces,
   And then such flying feet, imploring hands?

         Life: There's nought else to seek;
   Life only, little prized; but by design
         Of Nature prized.  How weak,
   How sad, how brief!  O how divine, divine!




A WIND OF CLEAR WEATHER IN ENGLAND


   O what a miracle wind is this
      Has crossed the English land to-day
   With an unprecedented kiss,
      And wonderfully found a way!

   Unsmirched incredibly and clean,
      Between the towns and factories,
   Avoiding, has his long flight been,
      Bringing a sky like Sicily's.

   O fine escape, horizon pure
      As Rome's!  Black chimneys left and right,
   But not for him, the straight, the sure,
      His luminous day, his spacious night.

   How keen his choice, how swift his feet!
      Narrow the way and hard to find!
   This delicate stepper and discreet
      Walked not like any worldly wind.

   Most like a man in man's own day,
      One of the few, a perfect one:
   His open earth--the single way;
      His narrow road--the open sun.




IN SLEEP


   I dreamt (no "dream" awake--a dream indeed)
   A wrathful man was talking in the park:
   "Where are the Higher Powers, who know our need
            And leave us in the dark?

   "There are no Higher Powers; there is no heart
   In God, no love"--his oratory here,
   Taking the paupers' and the cripples' part,
            Was broken by a tear.

   And then it seemed that One who did create
   Compassion, who alone invented pity,
   Walked, as though called, in at that north-east gate,
            Out from the muttering city;

   Threaded the little crowd, trod the brown grass,
   Bent o'er the speaker close, saw the tear rise,
   And saw Himself, as one looks in a glass,
            In those impassioned eyes.




THE DIVINE PRIVILEGE


   Lord, where are Thy prerogatives?
      Why, men have more than Thou hast kept;
   The king rewards, remits, forgives,
      The poet to a throne has stept.

   And Thou, despoiled, hast given away
      Worship to men, success to strife,
   Thy glory to the heavenly day,
      And made Thy sun the lord of life.

   Is one too precious to impart,
      One property reserved to Christ?
   One, cherished, grappled to that heart?
      --To be alone the Sacrificed?

   O Thou who lovest to redeem,
      One whom I know lies sore oppressed.
   Thou wilt not suffer me to dream
      That I can bargain for her rest.

   Seven hours I swiftly sleep, while she
      Measures the leagues of dark, awake.
   O that my dewy eyes might be
      Parched by a vigil for her sake!

   But O rejected!  O in vain!
      I cannot give who would not keep.
   I cannot buy, I cannot gain,
      I cannot give her half my sleep.




FREE WILL


   Dear are some hidden things
      My soul has sealed in silence; past delights,
   Hope unconfessed; desires with hampered wings,
      Remembered in the nights.

   But my best treasures are
      Ignoble, undelightful, abject, cold;
   Yet O! profounder hoards oracular
      No reliquaries hold.

   There lie my trespasses,
      Abjured but not disowned.  I'll not accuse
   Determinism, nor, as the Master {26} says,
      Charge even "the poor Deuce."

   Under my hand they lie,
      My very own, my proved iniquities,
   And though the glory of my life go by
      I hold and garner these.

   How else, how otherwhere.
      How otherwise, shall I discern and grope
   For lowliness?  How hate, how love, how dare,
      How weep, how hope?




THE TWO QUESTIONS


         "A riddling world!" one cried.
   "If pangs must be, would God that they were sent
   To the impure, the cruel, and passed aside
         The holy innocent!"

         But I, "Ah no, no, no!
   Not the clean heart transpierced; not tears that fall
   For a child's agony; not a martyr's woe;
         Not these, not these appal.

         "Not docile motherhood,
   Dutiful, frequent, closed in all distress;
   Not shedding of the unoffending blood;
         Not little joy grown less;

         "Not all-benign old age
   With dotage mocked; not gallantry that faints
   And still pursues; not the vile heritage
         Of sin's disease in saints;

         "Not these defeat the mind.
   For great is that abjection, and august
   That irony.  Submissive we shall find
         A splendour in that dust.

         "Not these puzzle the will;
   Not these the yet unanswered question urge.
   But the unjust stricken; but the hands that kill
         Lopped; but the merited scourge;

         "The sensualist at fast;
   The merciless felled; the liar in his snares.
   The cowardice of my judgment sees, aghast,
         The flail, the chaff, the tares."




THE LORD'S PRAYER


    "_Audemus dicere_ '_Pater Noster_.'"--CANON OF THE MASS.

         There is a bolder way,
   There is a wilder enterprise than this
   All-human iteration day by day.
   Courage, mankind!  Restore Him what is His.

         Out of His mouth were given
   These phrases.  O replace them whence they came.
   He, only, knows our inconceivable "Heaven,"
   Our hidden "Father," and the unspoken "Name";

         Our "trespasses," our "bread,"
   The "will" inexorable yet implored;
   The miracle-words that are and are not said,
   Charged with the unknown purpose of their Lord.

         "Forgive," "give," "lead us not"--
   Speak them by Him, O man the unaware,
   Speak by that dear tongue, though thou know not what,
   Shuddering through the paradox of prayer.




EASTER NIGHT


   All night had shout of men and cry
         Of woeful women filled His way;
   Until that noon of sombre sky
         On Friday, clamour and display
   Smote Him; no solitude had He,
   No silence, since Gethsemane.

   Public was Death; but Power, but Might,
         But Life again, but Victory,
   Were hushed within the dead of night,
         The shutter'd dark, the secrecy.
   And all alone, alone, alone
   He rose again behind the stone.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
