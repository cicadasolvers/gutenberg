TALBOT MUNDY


Edited by BRADFORD M. DAY





A Bit of His Life


Talbot Mundy was born in London on April 23, 1879. He was educated at
Rugby, and served nearly ten years, beginning in 1900, as a government
official in Africa and India. While in India, he wandered all over the
sub-continent on horseback, and even into Tibet. Eastern occult lore
first attracted, then fascinated, his active and unorthodox mind. Mundy
absorbed all he could learn of the Indian beliefs.

Government service next brought him to Africa where he studied
first-hand the nature magic of many of the tribes and cultures of East
Africa. His quest for more information on this subject impelled him to
travel extensively through Egypt and the Near East and even into parts
of Arabia. This was truly adventurous at the time, but only in character
with the man who killed dozens of lions and successfully hunted for
ivory.

Mundy visited Australia, and Mexico as far south as Yucutan. He first
arrived in the United States in 1911, and liked the country so much that
he decided to stay and become a citizen.

Mundy quickly turned his energies to writing, and an article, "Pig
Sticking in India," was accepted and published in the April 1911 issue
of Adventure Magazine, itself only a few months old. Another article and
his first story, "The Phantom Battery" soon appeared. For years
thereafter, Adventure had short stories, novelettes, novels, and serials
by this master teller of tales in most of the issues that were printed.

The motif and locale of the stories and very infrequent articles usually
stemmed from the areas, people, and occult knowledge previously
mentioned. The manly art of self defense must have occupied some of
Mundy's attention during his early career. A series of stories about
Billy Blain, pugilist, appeared under the pen-name of Walter Gait,
beginning with the February 1912 issue of Adventure. Two articles were
also printed under this pseudonym.

Scribners of New York produced his first book, "Rung Ho" in 1914, then
apparently forgot him. In 1916, Bobbs-Merrill of Indianapolis published
one of his most famous stories, "King--of the Khyber Rifles," and
Cassell and Company of London brought out "The Winds of the World." Both
were well received, and Mundy's career to a moderate renown was on its
way.

In succeeding years he continued to write for Adventure and other
magazines, most of the stories being snapped up by various book
publishers. Many of the books were reprinted in several editions by
different companies, and, confusing to a bibliophile, the English
publications ware often re-titled.

During the 1920's Mundy bought a part of the Point Loma estate in
California, called The Cliffs. He settled there for several years and
became a member of the Theosophical Society presided over by Katherine
Tingley. A half-dozen of his books were written there and, "Om; the
Secret of Ahbor Valley," shows the influence of this occult society.

He contributed many articles to Tingley's theosophical magazines, her
most noted publication being the Theosophical Path. After her death in
1929, Mundy left Point Loma but always retained his interest in and
sympathy with Theosophy.

Mundy continued writing almost to the time of his death on August 5,
1940. In all, forty-nine books were produced under his name, thirty-nine
of which were original works. At least one-hundred and fifty stories and
articles appeared in magazines; most of these, perhaps nearly all, are
listed in this bibliography. None of the theosophical articles are
included here, though, as the intent of this listing is to stress his
mastery of the fantasy-high adventure tale.

It is still too soon to properly evaluate Mundy's importance in the
stream of literature. His style of writing, choice of language, is
smoothly readable. One "fault," if such it be, is a sometimes too
carefully contrived buildup to plot situations. This careful skill did
result in glowing word-pictures and living characters.

Considerable assistance was given on this project by friends and fellow
enthusiasts. My grateful thanks to all as they come to mind:


Dr. J. Lloyd Eaton--Berkeley, California
John C. Nitka--Richmond Hill, New York
James A. Strand--Portland, Oregon
Walter A. Carrithers, Jr.--Fresno, California
Robert Resch--Reading, Pennsylvania
Richard Witter, Donald Grant, and some others
for appreciated words of caution and advice.

The following list must not be supposed the final and
authoritative word on this subject.

Is this an imaginary book?
THE MAN FROM JUPITER

    Claims have been advanced that Mundy wrote this work of science
    fiction. Doubtlessly most of the imaginative creation connected with
    this book is in the minds of the gulls who pass the name of this
    title along.

His sagas; with a story sequence of various characters
by Dr. J. Lloyd Eaton


Talbot Mundy was a prolific writer of historical tales and stories of
adventure-intrigue, his particular forte being tales of India and the
Near East. Twelve of his novels are listed in THE CHECKLIST OF FANTASTIC
LITERATURE, with themes of mysticism, black versus white magic,
lost-race, and even true science fiction. Many others of his stories are
borderline fantastics.

In the field of fantastic literature his works are highly prized (often
highly priced, also) and many such readers find, possibly to their
surprise, that they also enjoy his other stories. This may be due in
some part to the fact that Mundy used the same characters over and over
again, in novels in which each played the lead and as sub-characters in
other novels. One keeps meeting old friends.

This leads to one difficulty in reading Mundy, however. If one is going
to meet these characters, it is much more enjoyable to watch them
develop from birth, so to speak--and not vice versa, like coming into a
theatre in the middle of the picture. But, a reading sequence is a real
difficulty. Each story is complete in itself, but the characters are
re-shuffled into various combinations and any one of them may, and does,
strike off into a novel of his own, only to reappear at a later date in
some combination with other such characters. It is confusing, to say the
least. To add to the confusion, all or nearly all of Mundy's stories
first appeared in magazines, largely in Adventure, but later in Argosy.
As his popularity grew, his older stories were republished in book form,
as well as each of his new novels, so that the date of publication of
his books means nothing as far as reading chronology is concerned.

Before going any further, it may be interesting to digress a bit, and
consider some of his earlier stories in Adventure Magazine, and more
particularly as they apply to his books. No attempt is being made to
give a complete listing of his magazine stories here. Adventure Magazine
began publication in November 1910, but the earliest issue that I have
for reference is that of August 1911. This contains a short story by
Mundy, "The Phantom Battery." By this time he was publishing five to
eight short stories per year. These early stories were mostly about the
British Army and the most important was his "The Soul of A Regiment,"
(February 1913) a tale of native troops in the ill-fated first
expedition against the Dervishes in Egypt, with a surprise, terrific,
ending. This story was published as a book, "The Soul of A Regiment,"
(Alex Dulfer, San Francisco, 1925) and was anthologized by Arthur
Sullivant Hoffman in "Adventure's Beet Stories--1926" (Doran, New York,
1926). It was reprinted in Adventure Magazine in April 1917 and followed
next month be a sequel, "The Damned Old Nigger." Three of his early
novelettes (1913), "Hookum Hai," "For the Salt He Had Eaten," and
"Machassan Ah," will be found in the book "Told in the East,"
(Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, 1920). The first two concern the Sepoy
Revolt and the third is a humorous story of the British Navy. All are
good tales. The characters in the latter appear also in "An Arabian
Night" (Adventure, November 1913). The first of his Indian hillman type
stories is probably the short novel "The Letter of His Orders"
(Adventure, September 1913). His first serial, "For the Peace of India"
(Adventure, February to April 1914) was published in the book "Rung Ho"
(Scribners, New York, 1914) and is another good story of the Sepoy
Rebellion. In January and July 1914, appeared two stories about the
Princess Yasmini, a character that he used extensively in later
novels--as the lead, with King, with Ranjoor Singh, and in the
Jimgrim-Ramsden saga. The first of his sagas (Dick Anthony of Arran) was
never published in book form. This series included eight novelettes and
short novels, enough to fill four or five books, and appeared in
successive issues of Adventure Magazine, beginning August 1914. These
were very good adventure tales of a Scotch gentleman fighting for Iran
against Old Russia, but are rather dated now. Following this, most of
his novels appeared first in a magazine and were then immediately
published in book form.

This brings us to the "Jimgrim-Ramsden Saga," the greatest of them all.
If the early (and later) development of the associated characters is
added, it continues through twenty-one books (twenty-two novels), and
fifteen books (sixteen novels) for the actual Jimgrim-Ramsden stories.
This is not counting some eighteen novelettes and novels found in
magazines only.

This Saga, in the main, is the story of James Schuyler Grim, (Jimgrim) a
remarkable characterization, beginning as an American "Lawrence in
Arabia" and evolving into a human but unapproachable high priest of the
occult. There is Jeff Ramsden, the strong man and his closest friend,
who with the Australian, Jeremy Ross, make up the triumvirate of Grim,
Ross, and Ramsden, with their henchman Narayan Singh, the indomitable
Sikh. (Who cuts throats with an outward thrust.) Later the
multimillionaire, Meldrum Strange, hires them to fight evil. Then,
Athelbert King, a hero of novels in his own right, joins up, making a
quartet. Other characters from Mundy's novels appear--the seductive and
dangerous Princess Yasmini; Cotswold Ommony, the forester of India; the
Babu, Chullunder Ghose; the Gunga Sahib, and O'Hara.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
