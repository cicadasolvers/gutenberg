    _We found him in that Far-away_
       _that yet to us seems near--_
    _We vagrants of but yesterday_
       _when idlest youth was here,--_
    _When lightest song and laziest mirth_
       _possessed us through and through,_
    _And all the dreamy summer-earth_
       _seemed drugged with morning dew:_

    _When our ambition scarce had shot_
       _a stalk or blade indeed:_
    _Yours,--choked as in the garden-spot_
       _you still deferred to "weed":_
    _Mine,--but a pipe half-cleared of pith--_
       _as now it flats and whines_
    _In sympathetic cadence with_
       _a hiccough in the lines._

    _Aye, even then--O timely hour!--_
       _the High Gods did confer_
    _In our behalf:--And, clothed in power,_
       _lo, came their Courier--_
    _Not winged with flame nor shod with wind,--_
       _but ambling down the pike_,
    _Horseback, with saddlebags behind,_
       _and guise all human-like._

    _And it was given us to see,_
       _beneath his rustic rind,_
    _A native force and mastery_
       _of such inspiring kind,_
    _That half unconsciously we made_
       _obeisance.--Smiling, thus_
    _His soul shone from his eyes and laid_
       _its glory over us._

       *       *       *       *       *

    _Though, faring still that Far-away_
       _that yet to us seems near,_
    _His form, through mists of yesterday,_
       _fades from the vision here,_
    _Forever as he rides, it is_
       _in retinue divine,--_
    _The hearts of all his time are his,_
       _with your hale heart and mine._

RUBAIYAT
OF
DOC SIFERS




  I

    Ef you don't know DOC SIFERS I'll
       jes argy, here and now,
    You've bin a mighty little while
       about here, anyhow!
    'Cause Doc he's rid these roads and woods--
       er _swum_ 'em, now and then--
    And practised in this neighberhood
       sence hain't no tellin' when!


  II

    In radius o' fifteen mile'd,
       all p'ints o' compass round,
    No man er woman, chick er child,
       er team, on top o' ground,
    But knows _him_--yes, and got respects
       and likin' fer him, too,
    Fer all his so-to-speak dee-fects
       o' genius showin' through!


  III

    Some claims he's absent-minded; some
       has said they wuz afeard
    To take his powders when he come
       and dosed 'em out, and 'peared
    To have his mind on somepin' else--
       like County Ditch, er some
    New way o' tannin' mussrat-pelts,
       er makin' butter come.


[Illustration]


  IV

    He's cur'ous--they hain't no mistake
       about it!--but he's got
    Enough o' extry brains to make
       a _jury_--like as not.
    They's no _describin'_ Sifers,--fer,
       when all is said and done,
    He's jes _hisse'f Doc Sifers_--ner
       they hain't no other one!


  V

    Doc's allus sociable, polite,
       and 'greeable, you'll find--
    Pervidin' ef you strike him right
       and nothin' on his mind,--
    Like in some _hurry_, when they've sent
       fer Sifers _quick_, you see,
    To 'tend some sawmill-accident,
       er picnic jamboree;


  VI

    Er when the lightnin' 's struck some hare-
       brained harvest-hand; er in
    Some 'tempt o' suicidin'--where
       they'd ort to try ag'in!
    I've _knowed_ Doc haul up from a trot
       and talk a' hour er two
    When railly he'd a-ort o' not
       a-stopped fer "_Howdy-do!_"

[Illustration]


[Illustration]


  VII

    And then, I've met him 'long the road,
       _a-lopin'_,--starin' straight
    Ahead,--and yit he never knowed
       me when I hollered "_Yate,
    Old Saddlebags!_" all hearty-like,
       er "_Who you goin' to kill?_"
    And he'd say nothin'--only hike
       on faster, starin' still!


  VIII

    I'd bin insulted, many a time,
       ef I jes wuzn't shore
    Doc didn't mean a thing. And I'm
       not tetchy any more
    Sence that-air day, ef he'd a-jes
       a-stopped to jaw with _me_,
    They'd bin a little dorter less
       in my own fambily!


  IX

    Times _now_, at home, when Sifers' name
       comes up, I jes _let on_,
    You know, 'at I think Doc's to _blame_,
       the way he's bin and gone
    And disapp'inted folks--'Ll-_jee_-mun-_nee_!
       you'd ort to then
    Jes hear my wife light into me--
       "_ongratefulest o' men!_"


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


  X

    'Mongst _all_ the women--mild er rough,
       splendifferous er plain,
    Er them _with_ sense, er not enough
       to come in out the rain,--
    Jes ever' shape and build and style
       o' women, fat er slim--
    They all like Doc, and got a smile
       and pleasant word fer _him_!


  XI

    Ner hain't no horse I've ever saw
       but what'll neigh and try
    To sidle up to him, and paw,
       and sense him, ear-and-eye:
    Then jes a tetch o' Doc's old pa'm,
       to pat 'em, er to shove
    Along their nose--and they're as ca'm
       as any cooin' dove!


  XII

    And same with _dogs_,--take any breed,
       er strain, er pedigree,
    Er racial caste 'at can't concede
       no use fer you er me,--
    They'll putt all predju-dice aside
       in _Doc's_ case and go in
    Kahoots with him, as satisfied
       as he wuz kith-and-kin!


  XIII

    And Doc's a wonder, trainin' pets!--
       He's got a chicken-hawk,
    In kind o' half-cage, where he sets
       out in the gyarden-walk,
    And got that wild bird trained so tame,
       he'll loose him, and he'll fly
    Clean to the woods!--Doc calls his name--
       and he'll come, by-and-by!


[Illustration]


  XIV

    Some says no money down ud buy
       that bird o' Doc.--Ner no
    Inducement to the _bird_, says I,
       'at _he'd_ let _Sifers_ go!
    And Doc _he_ say 'at _he's_ content--
       long as a bird o' prey
    Kin 'bide _him_, it's a _compliment_,
       and takes it thataway.


  XV

    But, gittin' back to _docterin'_--all
       the sick and in distress,
    And old and pore, and weak and small,
       and lone and motherless,--
    I jes tell _you_ I 'preciate
       the man 'at 's got the love
    To "go ye forth and ministrate!"
       as Scriptur' tells us of.


  XVI

    _Dull_ times, Doc jes _mi_anders round,
       in that old rig o' his:
    And hain't no tellin' where he's bound
       ner guessin' where he is;
    He'll drive, they tell, jes thataway
       fer maybe six er eight
    Days at a stretch; and neighbers say
       he's bin clean round the State.


  XVII

    He picked a' old tramp up, one trip,
       'bout eighty mile'd from here,
    And fetched him home and k-yored his
       hip, and kep' him 'bout a year;
    And feller said--in all _his_ ja'nts
       round this terreschul ball
    'At no man wuz a _circumstance_
       to _Doc_!--he topped 'em all!--


[Illustration]


  XVIII

    Said, bark o' trees 's a' open book
       to Doc, and vines and moss
    He read like writin'--with a look
       knowed ever' dot and cross:
    Said, stars at night wuz jes as good
       's a compass: said, he s'pose
    You couldn't lose Doc in the woods
       the darkest night that blows!


  XIX

    Said, Doc'll tell you, purty clos't,
       by underbresh and plants,
    How fur off _warter_ is,--and 'most
       perdict the sort o' chance
    You'll have o' findin' _fish_; and how
       they're liable to _bite_,
    And whether they're a-bitin' now,
       er only after night.


  XX

    And, whilse we're talkin' _fish_,--I mind
       they formed a fishin'-crowd
    (When folks _could_ fish 'thout gittin' _fined_,
       and seinin' wuz allowed!)
    O' leadin' citizens, you know,
       to go and seine "Old Blue"--
    But hadn't no big seine, and so--
       w'y, what wuz they to do?...


  XXI

    And Doc he say he thought 'at _he_
       could _knit_ a stitch er two--
    "Bring the _materials_ to me--
       'at's all I'm astin' you!"
    And down he sets--six weeks, i jing!
       and knits that seine plum done--
    Made corks too, brails and ever'thing--
       good as a boughten one!


[Illustration]


  XXII

    Doc's _public_ sperit--when the sick
       's not takin' _all_ his time
    And he's got _some_ fer politics--
       is simple yit sublime:--
    He'll _talk_ his _principles_--and they
       air _honest_;--but the sly
    Friend strikes him first, election-day,
       he'd 'commodate, er die!


  XXIII

    And yit, though Doc, as all men knows,
       is square straight up and down,
    That vote o' his is--well, I s'pose--
       the cheapest one in town;--
    A fact 'at's sad to verify,
       as could be done on oath--
    I've voted Doc myse'f--_And I
       was criminal fer both!_


  XXIV

    You kin corrupt the _ballot-box_--corrupt
       _yourse'f_, as well--
    Corrupt _some_ neighbers,--but
       old Doc's as oncorruptible
    As Holy Writ. So putt a pin
       right there!--Let _Sifers_ be,
    I jucks! he wouldn't vote agin
       his own worst inimy!


  XXV

    When Cynthy Eubanks laid so low
       with fever, and Doc Glenn
    Told Euby Cynth 'ud haf to go--
       they sends fer _Sifers_ then!...
    Doc sized the case: "She's starved," says he,
       "fer _warter_--yes, and _meat_!
    The treatment 'at she'll git from _me_
       's all she kin drink and eat!"


[Illustration]


  XXVI

    He orders Euby then to split
       some wood, and take and build
    A fire in kitchen-stove, and git
       a young spring-chicken killed;
    And jes whirled in and th'owed his hat
       and coat there on the bed,
    And warshed his hands and sailed in that
       -air kitchen, Euby said,


  XXVII

    And biled that chicken-broth, and got
       that dinner--all complete
    And clean and crisp and good and hot
       as mortal ever eat!
    And Cynth and Euby both'll say
       'at Doc'll git as good
    Meals-vittles up, jes any day,
       as any _woman_ could!


  XXVIII

    Time Sister Abbick tuk so bad
       with striffen o' the lung,
    P'tracted Meetin', where she had
       jes shouted, prayed and sung
    All winter long, through snow and thaw,--
       when Sifers come, says he:
    "No, M'lissy; don't poke out your raw
       and cloven tongue at me!--


  XXIX

    "I know, without no symptoms but
       them _injarubber-shoes_
    You promised me to never putt
       a fool-foot in ner use
    At purril o' your life!" he said.
       "And I won't save you _now_,
    Onless--here on your dyin' bed--
       you consecrate your vow!"


  XXX

    Without a-claimin' _any creed_,
       Doc's rail religious views
    Nobody knows--ner got no _need_
       o' knowin' whilse he choose
    To be heerd not of man, ner raise
       no loud, vainglorious prayers
    In crowded marts, er public ways,
       er--i jucks, _any_wheres!--


[Illustration]


  XXXI

    'Less 'n it _is_ away deep down
       in his own heart, at night,
    Facin' the storm, when all the town
       's a-sleepin' snug and tight--
    Him splashin' hence from scenes o' pride
       and sloth and gilded show,
    To some pore sufferer's bedside
       o' anguish, don't you know!


  XXXII

    Er maybe dead o' _winter_--makes
       no odds to _Doc_,--he's got
    To face the weather ef it takes
       the hide off! 'cause he'll not
    _Lie_ out o' goin' and p'tend
       he's sick hisse'f--like _some_
    'At I could name 'at folks might send
       fer and they'd _never_ come!


[Illustration]


  XXXIII

    Like pore Phin Hoover--when he goes
       to that last dance o' his!
    That Chris'mus when his feet wuz froze--
       and Doc saved all they is
    Left of 'em--"'Nough," as Phin say now,
       "to _track_ me by, and be
    A adver_tise_ment, anyhow,
       o' what Doc's done fer me!--


  XXXIV

    "When _he_ come--knife-and-saw"--Phin say,
       "I knowed, ef I'd the spunk,
    'At Doc 'ud fix me up _some_ way,
       ef nothin' but my _trunk_
    Wuz left, he'd fasten _casters_ in,
       and have me, spick-and-span,
    A-skootin' round the streets ag'in
       as spry as any man!"


  XXXV

    Doc sees a patient's _got_ to quit--
       he'll ease him down serene
    As dozin' off to sleep, and yit
       not dope him with mor-_pheen_.--
    He won't tell _what_--jes 'lows 'at he
       has "airn't the right to sing
    'O grave, where is thy victery!
       O death, where is thy sting!'"


  XXXVI

    And, mind ye now!--it's not in scoff
       and scorn, by long degree,
    'At Doc gits things like that-un off:
       it's jes his _shority_
    And total faith in Life to Come,--
       w'y, "from that _Land o' Bliss_,"
    He says, "we'll haf to chuckle some,
       a-lookin' back at this!"


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


  XXXVII

    And, still in p'int, I mind, one _night
       o' 'nitiation_ at
    Some secert lodge, 'at Doc set right
       down on 'em, square and flat,
    When they mixed up some Scriptur' and
       wuz _funnin'_-like--w'y, he
    Lit in 'em with a rep'imand
       'at ripped 'em, A to Z!


  XXXVIII

    And onc't--when gineral loafin'-place
       wuz old Shoe-Shop--and all
    The gang 'ud git in there and brace
       their backs ag'inst the wall
    And _settle_ questions that had went
       onsettled long enough,--
    Like "wuz no Heav'n--ner no torment"--
       _jes talkin' awful rough!_


[Illustration]


  XXXIX

    There wuz Sloke Haines and old Ike Knight
       and Coonrod Simmes--all three
    Ag'inst the Bible and the Light,
       and scoutin' Deity.
    "_Science_," says Ike, "it _dimonstrates_--
       it takes nobody's word--
    _Scriptur'_ er not,--it _'vestigates_
       ef sich things could occurred!"


  XL

    Well, Doc he heerd this,--he'd drapped in
       a minute, fer to git
    A tore-off heel pegged on agin,--
       and, as he stood on it
    And stomped and grinned, he says to Ike,
       "I s'pose now, purty soon
    Some lightnin'-bug, indignant-like,
       'll ''vestigate' the moon!...


  XLI

    "No, Ike," says Doc, "this world hain't saw
       no brains like yourn and mine
    With sense enough to grasp a law
       'at takes a brain divine.--
    I've bared the thoughts of brains in doubt,
       and felt their finest pulse,--
    And mortal brains jes won't turn out
       omnipotent results!"


  XLII

    And Doc he's got respects to spare
       the _rich_ as well as _pore_--
    Says he, "I'd turn no _millionaire_
       onsheltered from my door."--
    Says he, "What's wealth to him in quest
       o' _honest_ friends to back
    And love him fer _hisse'f_?--not jes
       because he's made his jack!"


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


  XLIII

    And childern.--_Childern?_ Lawzy-day!
       Doc _worships_ 'em!--You call
    Round at his house and _ast_ 'em!--
       they're a-_swarmin'_ there--that's all!--
    They're in his _Li_b'ry--in best room--
       in kitchen--fur and near,--
    In office too, and, I p'sume,
       his operatin'-cheer!


  XLIV

    You know they's men 'at _bees_ won't sting?--
       They's plaguey _few_,--but Doc
    He's one o' _them_.--And same, i jing!
       with _childern_;--they jes flock
    Round Sifers _natchurl_!--in his lap,
       and in his pockets, too,
    And in his old fur mitts and cap,
       and _heart_ as warm and true!


  XLV

    It's cur'ous, too,--'cause Doc
       hain't got no childern of his own--
    'Ceptin' the ones he's tuk
       and brought up, 'at's bin left alone.
    And orphans when their father died,
       er mother,--and Doc he
    Has he'pped their dyin' satisfied.--
       "The child shall live with me

    "And Winniferd, my wife," he'd say,
       and stop right there, and cle'r
    His th'oat, and go on thinkin' way
       _some_ mother-hearts down here
    Can't never feel _their own_ babe's face
       a-pressin' 'em, ner make
    Their naked breasts a restin'-place
       fer any baby's sake.

    Doc's _Li_b'ry--as he calls it,--well,
       they's ha'f-a-dozen she'ves
    Jam-full o' books--I couldn't tell
       _how_ many--count yourse'ves!
    _One whole she'f's_ Works on Medicine!
       and most the rest's about
    First Settlement, and Indians in
       here,--'fore we driv 'em out.--


  XLVIII

    And Plutarch's Lives--and life also
       o' Dan'el Boone, and this-
    Here Mungo Park, and Adam Poe--
       jes all the _lives_ they is!
    And Doc's got all the _novels_ out,--
       by Scott and Dickison
    And Cooper.--And, I make no doubt,
       he's read 'em ever' one!

  XLIX

    Onc't, in his office, settin' there,
       with crowd o' eight er nine
    Old neighbers with the time to spare,
       and Doc a-feelin' fine,
    A man rid up from Rollins, jes
       fer Doc to write him out
    Some blame p'scription--done, I guess,
       in minute, nigh about.--


[Illustration]


  L

    And _I_ says, "Doc, you 'pear so spry,
       jes write me that recei't
    You have fer bein' _happy_ by,--
       fer that 'u'd shorely beat
    Your _medicine_!" says I.--And quick
       as _s'cat!_ Doc turned and writ
    And handed me: "Go he'p the sick,
       and putt your heart in it."


  LI

    And then, "A-talkin' furder 'bout
       that line o' thought," says he,
    "Ef we'll jes do the work cut out
       and give' to you and me,
    We'll lack no joy, ner appetite,
       ner all we'd ort to eat,
    And sleep like childern ever' night--
       as puore and ca'm and sweet."


  LII

    Doc _has_ bin 'cused o' _offishness_
       and lack o' talkin' free
    And extry friendly; but he says,
       "I'm _'feard_ o' talk," says he,--
    "I've got," he says, "a natchurl turn
       fer talkin' fit to kill.--
    The best and hardest thing to learn
       is trick o' keepin' still."


  LIII

    Doc _kin_ smoke, and I s'pose he _might_
       drink licker--jes fer fun.
    He says, "_You_ smoke, _you_ drink all right;
       but _I_ don't--neether one"--
    Says, "I _like_ whiskey--'good old rye'--
       but like it in its place,
    Like that-air warter in your eye,
       er nose there on your face."


  LIV

    Doc's bound to have his joke! The day
       he got that off on me
    I jes had sold a load o' hay
       at "Scofield's Livery,"
    And tolled Doc in the shed they kep'
       the hears't in, where I'd hid
    The stuff 'at got me "out o' step,"
       as Sifers said it did.


  LV

    Doc hain't, to say, no "_rollin' stone_,"
       and yit he hain't no hand
    Fer '_cumulatin_'.--_Home_'s his own,
       and scrap o' farmin'-land--
    Enough to keep him out the way
       when folks is tuk down sick
    The suddentest--'most any day
       they want him 'special quick.


[Illustration]


  LVI

    And yit Doc loves his practice; ner
       don't, wilful, want to slight
    No call--no matter who--how fur
       away--er day er night.--
    He loves his work--he loves his friends--
       June, Winter, Fall, and Spring:
    His _lovin'_--facts is--never ends;
       he loves jes _ever_'thing....


  LVII

    'Cept--_keepin' books_. He never sets
       down no accounts.--He hates,
    The worst of all, collectin' debts--
       the worst, the more he waits.--
    I've knowed him, when at last he _had_
       to dun a man, to end
    By makin' him a loan--and mad
       he hadn't more to lend.


  LVIII

    When Pence's Drug Store ust to be
       in full blast, they wuz some
    Doc's patients got things frekantly
       there, charged to him, i gum!--
    Doc run a bill there, don't you know,
       and allus when he squared,
    He never questioned nothin',--so
       he had his feelin's spared.


  LIX

    Now sich as that, I hold and claim,
       hain't _'scusable_--it's not
    _Perfessional!_--It's jes a shame
       'at Doc hisse'f hain't got
    No better _business_-sense! That's why
       lots 'd respect him more,
    And not give him the clean go-by
       fer _other_ doctors. Shore!


[Illustration]


  LX

    This-here Doc _Glenn_, fer instance;
       er this little jack-leg _Hall_;--
    They're _business_--folks respects
       'em fer their _business_ more 'n all
    They ever knowed, er ever _will_,
       'bout _medicine_.--Yit they
    Collect their money, k-yore er kill.--
       They're _business_, anyway!

    You ast Jake Dunn;--he's worked it out
       in _figgers_.--He kin show
    _Stastistics_ how Doc's airnt about
       _three_ fortunes in a row,--
    Ever' ten-year' hand-runnin' straight--
       _three_ of 'em--_thirty_ year'
    'At Jake kin count and 'lucidate
       o' Sifers' practice here.


  LXII

    Yit--"Praise the Lord," says Doc,
       "we've got our little home!" says he--
    "(It's railly _Winniferd's_, but
       what she owns, she sheers with me.)
    We' got our little gyarden-spot,
       and peach- and apple-trees,
    And stable, too, and chicken-lot,
       and eighteen hive' o' bees."


[Illustration]

[Blank Page]


  LXIII

    _You_ call it anything you please,
       but it's _witchcraft_--the power
    'At Sifers has o' handlin' bees!--
       He'll watch 'em by the hour--
    Mix right amongst 'em, mad and hot
       and swarmin'!--yit they won't
    Sting _him_, er _want_ to--_'pear_ to not,--
       at least I know they _don't_.


  LXIV

    With _me_ and bees they's no _p'tense_
       o' social-bility--
    A dad-burn bee 'u'd climb a fence
       to git a whack at _me_!
    I s'pose no thing 'at's _got_ a sting
       is railly satisfied
    It's _sharp_ enough, ontel, i jing!
       he's honed it on my hide!


  LXV

    And Doc he's allus had a knack
       _inventin'_ things.--Dee-vised
    A windlass wound its own se'f back
       as it run down: and s'prised
    Their new hired girl with _clothes-line_, too,
       and _clothes-pins_, all in _one_:
    Purt'-nigh all left fer _her_ to do
       wuz git her _primpin'_ done!


  LXVI

    And onc't, I mind, in airly Spring,
       and tappin' sugar-trees,
    Doc made a dad-burn little thing
       to sharpen _spiles_ with--these-
    Here wood'-spouts 'at the peth's punched out,
       and driv' in where they bore
    The auger-holes. He sharpened 'bout
       _a million_ spiles er more!


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


  LXVII

    And Doc's the first man ever swung
       a _bucket_ on a tree
    Instid o' _troughs_; and first man brung
       _grained_ sugar--so's 'at he
    Could use it fer his coffee, and
       fer cookin', don't you know.--
    Folks come clean up from Pleasantland
       'fore they'd _believe_ it, though!


  LXVIII

    And all Doc's stable-doors _on_locks
       and locks _theirse'ves_--and gates
    The same way;--all rigged up like clocks,
       with pulleys, wheels, and weights,--
    So, 's Doc says, "drivin' _out_, er _in_,
       they'll _open_; and they'll _then_,
    All quiet-like, shet up ag'in
       like little gentlemen!"


  LXIX

    And Doc 'ud made a mighty good
       _detective_.--Neighbers all
    Will testify to _that_--er _could_,
       ef they wuz legal call:
    His theories on any crime
       is worth your listenin' to.--
    And he has hit 'em, many a time,
       'long 'fore established true.

    At this young druggist Wenfield Pence's
       trial fer his life,
    On _primy faishy_ evidence
       o' pizonin' his wife,
    _Doc's_ testimony saved and cle'red
       and 'quitted him and freed
    Him so 's he never even 'peared
       cog-_ni_zant of the deed!


  LXXI

    The facts wuz--Sifers testified,--
       at inquest he had found
    The stummick showed the woman _died_
       o' pizon, but had downed
    The dos't _herse'f_,--because _amount_
       and _cost_ o' drug imployed
    No _druggist_ would, on _no_ account,
       a-lavished and distroyed!


  LXXII

    Doc tracked a blame-don burgler down,
       and _nailed_ the scamp, to boot,
    But told him ef he'd leave the town
       he wouldn't prosecute.
    He traced him by a tied-up thumb-print
       in fresh putty, where
    Doc glazed it. Jes _that's_ how he come
       to track him to his lair!


  LXXIII

    Doc's jes a _leetle_ too inclined,
       _some_ thinks, to overlook
    The criminal and vicious kind
       we'd ort to bring to book
    And punish, 'thout no extry show
       o' _sympathizin'_, where
    _They_ hain't showed none fer _us_, you know.
       But he takes issue there:


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


  LXXIV

    Doc argies 'at "The Red-eyed Law,"
       as _he_ says, "ort to learn
    To lay a mighty leenient paw
       on deeds o' sich concern
    As only the Good Bein' knows
       the wherefore of, and spreads
    His hands above accused and sows
       His mercies on their heads."


  LXXV

    Doc even holds 'at _murder_ hain't
       no crime we got a right
    To _hang_ a man fer--claims it's _taint_
       o' _lunacy_, er _quite_.--
    "Hold _sich_ a man responsibul
       fer murder," Doc says,--"then,
    When _he's_ hung, where's the rope to pull
       them _sound-mind_ jurymen?


  LXXVI

    "It's in a nutshell--_all_ kin see,"
       says Doc,--"it's cle'r the _Law's_
    As ap' to err as you er me,
       and kill without a cause:
    The man most innocent o' sin
       _I_'ve saw, er _'spect_ to see,
    Wuz servin' a life-sentence in
       the penitentchury."


[Illustration]


  LXXVII

    And Doc's a whole hand at a _fire_!--
       directin' how and where
    To set your ladders, low er higher,
       and what first duties air,--
    Like formin' warter-bucket-line;
       and best man in the town
    To chop holes in old roofs, and mine
       defective chimblies down:


  LXXVIII

    Er durin' any public crowd,
       mass-meetin', er big day,
    Where ladies ortn't be allowed,
       as I've heerd Sifers say,--
    When they's a suddent rush somewhere,
       it's Doc's voice, ca'm and cle'r,
    Says, "Fall back, men, and give her air!--
       that's all she's faintin' fer."


[Illustration]


  LXXIX

    The sorriest I ever feel
       fer Doc is when some show
    Er circus comes to town and he'll
       not git a chance to go.
    'Cause he jes natchurly _de_lights
       in circuses--clean down
    From tumblers, in their spangled tights,
       to trick-mule and Old Clown.


  LXXX

    And ever'body _knows_ it, too,
       how Doc is, thataway!...
    I mind a circus onc't come through--
       wuz there myse'f that day.--
    Ringmaster cracked his whip, you know,
       to start the ridin'--when
    In runs Old Clown and hollers "_Whoa!_--
       Ladies and gentlemen


  LXXXI

    "Of this vast audience, I fain
       would make in_qui_ry cle'r,
    And learn, find out, and ascertain--
       _Is Doctor Sifers here?_"
    And when some fool-voice bellers down:
       "He is! He's settin' in
    Full view o' ye!" "_Then_," says the Clown,
       "_the circus may begin!_"


  LXXXII

    Doc's got a _temper_; but, he says,
       he's learnt it which is boss,
    Yit has to _watch_ it, more er less....
       I never seen him cross
    But onc't, enough to make him swear;--
       milch-cow stepped on his toe,
    And Doc ripped out "_I doggies!_"--There's
       the only case I know.


  LXXXIII

    Doc says that's what your temper's fer--
       to hold back out o' view,
    And learn it never to occur
       on out ahead o' _you_.--
    "_You_ lead the way," says Sifers--"git
       your _temper_ back in line--
    And _furdest_ back the _best_, ef it's
       as mean a one as mine!"


[Illustration]

[Blank Page]


  LXXXIV

    He hates contentions--can't abide
       a wrangle er dispute
    O' any kind; and he 'ull slide
       out of a crowd and skoot
    Up some back-alley 'fore he'll stand
       and listen to a furse
    When ary one's got upper-hand
       and t' other one's got worse.


  LXXXV

    Doc says: "I 'spise, when pore and weak
       and awk'ard talkers fails,
    To see it's them with hardest cheek
       and loudest mouth prevails.--
    A' all-one-sided quarr'l'll make
       me _biased_, mighty near,--
    'Cause ginerly the side I take's
       the one I never hear."


  LXXXVI

    What 'peals to Doc the most and best
       is "seein' folks _agreed_,
    And takin' ekal interest
       and universal heed
    O' ever'body _else's_ words
       and idies--same as we
    Wuz glad and chirpy as the birds--
       jes as we'd _ort_ to be!"


  LXXXVII

    And _paterotic_! Like to git
       Doc started, full and fair,
    About the war, and why 't 'uz fit,
       and what wuz 'complished there;
    "And who wuz _wrong_," says Doc, "er
       _right_, 't 'uz waste o' blood and tears,
    All prophesied in _Black_ and _White_ fer
       years and years and years!"


[Illustration]


  LXXXVIII

    And then he'll likely kind o' tetch
       on old John Brown, and dwell
    On what _his_ warnin's wuz; and ketch
       his breath and cough, and tell
    On down to Lincoln's death. And _then_--
       well, he jes chokes and quits
    With "I must go now, gentlemen!"
       and grabs his hat, and _gits_!


  LXXXIX

    Doc's own war-rickord wuzn't won
       so much in line o' fight
    As line o' work and nussin' done
       the wownded, day and night.--
    His wuz the hand, through dark and dawn,
       'at bound their wownds, and laid
    As soft as their own mother's on
       their forreds when they prayed....


  XC

    His wuz the face they saw the first--
       all dim, but smilin' bright,
    As they come to and knowed the worst,
       yit saw the old _Red-White-
    And-Blue_ where Doc had fixed it where
       they'd see it _wavin'_ still,
    Out through the open tent-flap there,
       er 'cros't the winder-sill.


  XCI

    And some's a-limpin' round here yit--
       a-waitin' Last Review,--
    'U'd give the pensions 'at they git,
       and pawn their crutches, too,
    To he'p Doc out, ef he wuz pressed
       financial'--same as he
    Has _allus_ he'pped them when distressed--
       ner never tuk a fee.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


  XCII

    Doc never wuz much hand to pay
       attention to _p'tence_
    And fuss-and-feathers and display
       in men o' prominence:
    "A railly _great_ man," Sifers 'lows,
       "is not the out'ard dressed--
    All uniform, salutes and bows,
       and swellin' out his chest.


  XCIII

    "I _met_ a great man onc't," Doc says,
       "and shuk his hand," says he,
    "And _he_ come 'bout in _one_, I guess,
       o' disapp'intin' _me_--
    He talked so common-like, and brought
       his mind so cle'r in view
    And simple-like, I purt'-nigh thought,
       '_I'm_ best man o' the two!'"


  XCIV

    Yes-_sir_! Doc's got convictions and
       old-fashioned kind o' ways
    And idies 'bout this glorious Land
       o' Freedom; and he'll raise
    His hat clean off, no matter where,
       jes ever' time he sees
    The Stars and Stripes a-floatin' there
       and flappin' in the breeze.


[Illustration]


  XCV

    And tunes like old "Red, White and Blue"
       'll fairly drive him wild,
    Played on the brass band, marchin' through
       the streets! Jes like a child
    I've saw that man, his smile jes set,
       all kind o' pale and white,
    Bare-headed, and his eyes all wet,
       yit dancin' with delight!


  XCVI

    And yit, that very man we see
       all trimbly, pale and wann,
    Give him a case o' _surgery_,
       we'll see another man!--
    _We_'ll do the trimblin' then, and _we_'ll
       git white around the gills--
    He'll show us _nerve_ o' nerves, and he 'ull
       show us _skill_ o' skills!


  XCVII

    _Then_ you could toot your horns and beat
       your drums and bang your guns,
    And wave your flags and march the street,
       and charge, all Freedom's sons!--
    And Sifers _then_, I bet my hat,
       'u'd never flinch a hair,
    But, stiddy-handed, 'tend to that
       pore patient layin' there.


  XCVIII

    And Sifers' _eye_'s as stiddy as
       that hand o' his!--He'll shoot
    A' old-style rifle, like he has,
       and smallest bore, to boot,
    With any fancy rifles made
       to-day, er expert shot
    'At works at shootin' like a _trade_--
       and all _some_ of 'em's got!


[Illustration]


  XCIX

    Let 'em go right out in the _woods_
       with Doc, and leave their "traps"
    And blame glass-balls and queensware-goods,
       and see how Sifers draps
    A squirrel out the tallest tree.--
       And 'fore he fires he'll say
    Jes where he'll hit him--yes, sir-_ee_!
       And he's hit thataway!


  C

    Let 'em go out with him, i jucks!
       with fishin'-pole and gun,--
    And ekal chances, fish and ducks,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
