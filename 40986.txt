TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.


The work of which I here offer an English translation has excited,
among the Dutch and German literary societies, a keen controversy
in regard to its authenticity--a controversy not yet brought to
a conclusion, some affirming that it contains internal evidence of
truth, while others declare it to be a forgery. But even the latter
do not insist on its being the work of a modern fabricator. They
allow it to be one hundred, or perhaps one hundred and fifty, years
old. If they admit that, I do not see why they refuse it a greater
antiquity; and as to the improbability of the stories related in it,
I refer the reader to the exhaustive inquiry in Dr Ottema's Preface.

Is it more difficult to believe that the early Frisians, being hardy
and intrepid marine adventurers, sailed to the Mediterranean, and
even proceeded farther, than that the Phoenicians sailed to England
for tin, and to the Baltic for amber? or that a clever woman became a
lawgiver at Athens, than that a goddess sprang, full grown and armed,
from the cleft skull of Jupiter?

There is nothing in the narratives of this book inconsistent with
probability, however they may vary from some of our preconceived
ideas; but whether it is really what it pretends to be--a very ancient
manuscript, or a more modern fiction--it is not the less a most curious
and interesting work, and as such I offer it to the British public.

In order to give an idea of the manuscript, I have procured photographs
of two of its pages, which are bound with this volume.

I have also followed Dr Ottema's plan of printing the original Frisian
opposite to the translation, so that any reader possessing a knowledge
of the language may verify the correctness of the translation.

In addition to the Preface which I have translated, Dr Ottema
has written two pamphlets on the subject of the Oera Linda Book
(1. Historical Notes and Explanations; 2. The Royal Academy and Het
Oera Linda Bok), both of which would be very valuable to any one who
wished to study the controversy respecting the authenticity of the
work, but which I have not thought it necessary to translate for the
present publication.

There has also appeared in the "Deventer Courant" a series of twelve
letters on the same subject. Though written anonymously, I believe
they are from the pen of Professor Vitringa. They have been translated
into German by Mr Otto.

The writer evidently entered upon his task of criticism with a feeling
of disbelief in the authenticity of the book; but in his last letter
he admits that, after a minute examination, he is unable to pronounce
a positive conviction either for or against it.

His concluding remarks are to the following effect:--

"If the book is a romance, then I must admit that it has been written
with a good object, and by a clever man, because the sentiments
expressed in it are of a highly moral tendency; and the facts
related, so far as they can be controlled by regular history, are
not untruthful; and where they deal with events of which we have no
historical records, they do not offend our ideas of possibility or
even probability."

INTRODUCTION.


C. over de Linden, Chief Superintendent of the Royal Dockyard at
the Helder, possesses a very ancient manuscript, which has been
inherited and preserved in his family from time immemorial, without
any one knowing whence it came or what it contained, owing to both
the language and the writing being unknown.

All that was known was that a tradition contained in it had from
generation to generation been recommended to careful preservation. It
appeared that the tradition rests upon the contents of two letters,
with which the manuscript begins, from Hiddo oera Linda, anno 1256,
and from Liko oera Linda, anno 803. It came to C. over de Linden by
the directions of his grandfather, Den Heer Andries over de Linden,
who lived at Enkhuizen, and died there on the 15th of April 1820,
aged sixty-one. As the grandson was at that time barely ten years old,
the manuscript was taken care of for him by his aunt, Aafje Meylhoff,
born Over de Linden, living at Enkhuizen, who in August 1848 delivered
it to the present possessor.

Dr E. Verwijs having heard of this, requested permission to examine the
manuscript, and immediately recognised it as very ancient Fries. He
obtained at the same time permission to make a copy of it for the
benefit of the Friesland Society, and was of opinion that it might
be of great importance, provided it was not supposititious, and
invented for some deceptive object, which he feared. The manuscript
being placed in my hands, I also felt very doubtful, though I could
not understand what object any one could have in inventing a false
composition only to keep it a secret. This doubt remained until
I had examined carefully-executed facsimiles of two fragments, and
afterwards of the whole manuscript--the first sight of which convinced
me of the great age of the document.

Immediately occurred to me Caesar's remark upon the writing of the
Gauls and the Helvetians in his "Bello Gallico" (i. 29, and vi. 14),
"Graecis utuntur literis," though it appears in v. 48 that they were not
entirely Greek letters. Caesar thus points out only a resemblance--and
a very true one--as the writing, which does not altogether correspond
with any known form of letters, resembles the most, on a cursory
view, the Greek writing, such as is found on monuments and the oldest
manuscripts, and belongs to the form which is called lapidary. Besides,
I formed the opinion afterwards that the writer of the latter part
of the book had been a contemporary of Caesar.

The form and the origin of the writing is so minutely and fully
described in the first part of the book, as it could not be in any
other language. It is very complete, and consists of thirty-four
letters, among which are three separate forms of a and u, and two of
e, i, y, and o, besides four pairs of double consonants--ng, th, ks,
and gs. The ng, which as a nasal sound has no particular mark in any
other Western language, is an indivisible conjunction; the th is soft,
as in English, and is sometimes replaced by d; the gs is seldom met
with--I believe only in the word segse, to say, in modern Fries sidse,
pronounced sisze.

The paper, of large quarto size, is made of cotton, not very thick,
without water-mark or maker's mark, made upon a frame or wire-web,
with not very broad perpendicular lines.

An introductory letter gives the year 1256 as that in which
this manuscript was written by Hiddo overa Linda on foreign
paper. Consequently it must have come from Spain, where the Arabs
brought into the market paper manufactured from cotton.

On this subject, W. Wattenbach writes in his "Das Schriftwesen im
Mittelalter" (Leipzig, 1871), s. 93:--

"The manufacture of paper from cotton must have been in use among the
Chinese from very remote times, and must have become known to the
Arabs by the conquest of Samarcand about the year 704. In Damascus
this manufacture was an important branch of industry, for which reason
it was called Charta Damascena. By the Arabians this art was brought
to the Greeks. It is asserted that Greek manuscripts of the tenth
century written upon cotton paper exist, and that in the thirteenth
century it was much more used than parchment. To distinguish it from
Egyptian paper it was called Charta bombicina, gossypina, cuttunea,
xylina. A distinction from linen paper was not yet necessary. In the
manufacture of the cotton paper raw cotton was originally used. We
first find paper from rags mentioned by Petrus Clusiacensis (1122-50).

"The Spaniards and the Italians learned the manufacture of this paper
from the Arabians. The most celebrated factories were at Jativa,
Valencia, Toledo, besides Fabriano in the March of Ancona." [1]

In Germany the use of this material did not become very extended,
whether it came from Italy or Spain. Therefore the further this
preparation spread from the East and the adjoining countries,
the more necessity there was that linen should take the place of
cotton. A document of Kaufbeuren on linen paper of the year 1318
is of very doubtful genuineness. Bodman considers the oldest pure
linen paper to be of the year 1324, but up to 1350 much mixed paper
was used. All carefully-written manuscripts of great antiquity show
by the regularity of their lines that they must have been ruled,
even though no traces of the ruled lines can be distinguished. To
make the lines they used a thin piece of lead, a ruler, and a pair
of compasses to mark the distances.

In old writings the ink is very black or brown; but while there has
been more writing since the thirteenth century, the colour of the ink
is often grey or yellowish, and sometimes quite pale, showing that it
contains iron. All this affords convincing proof that the manuscript
before us belongs to the middle of the thirteenth century, written with
clear black letters between fine lines carefully traced with lead. The
colour of the ink shows decidedly that it does not contain iron. By
these evidences the date given, 1256, is satisfactorily proved, and
it is impossible to assign any later date. Therefore all suspicion
of modern deception vanishes.

The language is very old Fries, still older and purer than the Fries
Rjuchtboek or old Fries laws, differing from that both in form and
spelling, so that it appears to be an entirely distinct dialect,
and shows that the locality of the language must have been (as it
was spoken) between the Vlie and the Scheldt.

The style is extremely simple, concise, and unembarrassed, resembling
that of ordinary conversation, and free in the choice of the words. The
spelling is also simple and easy, so that the reading of it does
not involve the least difficulty, and yet with all its regularity,
so unrestricted, that each of the separate writers who have worked
at the book has his own peculiarities, arising from the changes in
pronunciation in a long course of years, which naturally must have
happened, as the last part of the work is written five centuries
after the first.

As a specimen of antiquity in language and writing, I believe I may
venture to say that this book is unique of its kind.

The writing suggests an observation which may be of great importance.

The Greeks know and acknowledge that their writing was not their
own invention. They attribute the introduction of it to Kadmus, a
Phenician. The names of their oldest letters, from Alpha to Tau, agree
so exactly with the names of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet, with
which the Phenician will have been nearly connected, that we cannot
doubt that the Hebrew was the origin of the Phenician. But the form
of their letters differs so entirely from that of the Phenician and
Hebrew writing, that in that particular no connection can be thought
of between them. Whence, then, have the Greeks derived the form of
their letters?

From "thet bok thera Adela folstar" ("The Book of Adela's Followers")
we learn that in the time when Kadmus is said to have lived, about
sixteen centuries before Christ, a brisk trade existed between the
Frisians and the Phenicians, whom they named Kadhemar, or dwellers
on the coast.

The name Kadmus comes too near the word Kadhemar for us not to believe
that Kadmus simply meant a Phenician.

Further on we learn that about the same time a priestess of the castle
in the island of Walcheren, Min-erva, also called Nyhellenia, had
settled in Attica at the head of a Frisian colony, and had founded
a castle at Athens. Also, from the accounts written on the walls of
Waraburch, that the Finns likewise had a writing of their own--a
very troublesome and difficult one to read--and that, therefore,
the Tyrians and the Greeks had learned the writing of Frya. By this
representation the whole thing explains itself, and it becomes clear
whence comes the exterior resemblance between the Greek and the old
Fries writing, which Caesar also remarked among the Gauls; as likewise
in what manner the Greeks acquired and retained the names of the Finn
and the forms of the Fries writing.

Equally remarkable are the forms of their figures. We usually call
our figures Arabian, although they have not the least resemblance
to those used by the Arabs. The Arabians did not bring their ciphers
from the East, because the Semitic nations used the whole alphabet in
writing numbers. The manner of expressing all numbers by ten signs
the Arabs learned in the West, though the form was in some measure
corresponding with their writing, and was written from left to right,
after the Western fashion. Our ciphers seem here to have sprung from
the Fries ciphers (siffar), which form had the same origin as the
handwriting, and is derived from the lines of the Juul?

The book as it lies before us consists of two parts, differing widely
from each other, and of dates very far apart. The writer of the
first part calls herself Adela, wife of Apol, chief man of the Linda
country. This is continued by her son Adelbrost, and her daughter
Apollonia. The first book, running from page 1 to 88, is written by
Adela. The following part, from 88 to 94, is begun by Adelbrost and
continued by Apollonia. The second book, running from page 94 to 114,
is written by Apollonia. Much later, perhaps two hundred and fifty
years, a third book is written, from page 114 to 134, by Frethorik;
then follows from page 134 to 143, written by his widow, Wiljow;
after that from page 144 to 169 by their son, Konereed; and then
from page 169 to 192 by their grandson, Beeden. Pages 193 and 194,
with which the last part must have begun, are wanting, therefore the
writer is unknown. He may probably have been a son of Beeden.

On page 134, Wiljow makes mention of another writing of Adela. These
she names "thet bok thera sanga (thet boek), thera tellinga," and "thet
Hellenia bok;" and afterwards "tha skrifta fon Adela jeftha Hellenia."

To fix the date we must start from the year 1256 of our era, when Hiddo
overa Linda made the copy, in which he says that it was 3449 years
after Atland was sunk. This disappearance of the old land (aldland,
atland) was known by the Greeks, for Plato mentions in his "Timaeus,"
24, the disappearance of Atlantis, the position of which was only known
as somewhere far beyond the Pillars of Hercules. From this writing it
appears that it was land stretching far out to the west of Jutland,
of which Heligoland and the islands of North Friesland are the last
barren remnants. This event, which occasioned a great dispersion of
the Frisian race, became the commencement of a chronological reckoning
corresponding with 2193 before Christ, and is known by geologists as
the Cimbrian flood.

On page 80 begins an account in the year 1602, after the disappearance
of Atland, and thus in the year 591 before Christ; and on page 82 is
the account of the murder of Frana, "Eeremoeder," of Texland two years
later--that is, in 589. When, therefore, Adela commences her writing
with her own coming forward in an assembly of the people thirty years
after the murder of the Eeremoeder, that must have been in the year
559 before Christ. In the part written by her daughter Apollonia, we
find that fifteen months after the assembly Adela was killed by the
Finns in an attack by surprise of Texland. This must accordingly have
happened 557 years before Christ. Hence it follows that the first book,
written by Adela, was of the year 558 before Christ. The second book,
by Apollonia, we may assign to about the year 530 before Christ. The
latter part contains the history of the known kings of Friesland,
Friso, Adel (Ubbo), and Asega Askar, called Black Adel. Of the third
king, Ubbo, nothing is said, or rather that part is lost, as the pages
169 to 188 are missing. Frethorik, the first writer, who appears now,
was a contemporary of the occurrences which he relates, namely,
the arrival of Friso. He was a friend of Liudgert den Geertman,
who, as rear-admiral of the fleet of Wichhirte, the sea-king, had
come with Friso in the year 303 before Christ, 1890 years after the
disappearance of Atland. He has borrowed most of his information from
the log-book of Liudgert.

The last writer gives himself out most clearly as a contemporary of
Black Adel or Askar, about the middle of his reign, which Furmerius
states to have been from 70 before Christ to 11 after the birth of
Christ, the same period as Julius Caesar and Augustus. He therefore
wrote in the middle of the last century before Christ, and knew of
the conquest of Gaul by the Romans. It is thus evident that there
elapsed fully two centuries between the two parts of the work.

Of the Gauls we read on page 84 that they were called the "Missionaries
of Sydon." And on page 124 "that the Gauls are Druids." The Gauls,
then, were Druids, and the name Galli, used for the whole nation,
was really only the name of an order of priesthood brought from the
East, just as among the Romans the Galli were priests of Cybele.



The whole contents of the book are in all respects new. That is to
say, there is nothing in it that we were acquainted with before. What
we here read of Friso, Adel, and Askar differs entirely from what
is related by our own chroniclers, or rather presents it in quite
another light. For instance, they all relate that Friso came from
India, and that thus the Frisians were of Indian descent; and yet
they add that Friso was a German, and belonged to a Persian race which
Herodotus called Germans (Germanioi). According to the statement in
this book, Friso did come from India, and with the fleet of Nearchus;
but he is not therefore an Indian. He is of Frisian origin, of Frya's
people. He belongs, in fact, to a Frisian colony which after the death
of Nijhellenia, fifteen and a half centuries before Christ, under the
guidance of a priestess Geert, settled in the Punjab, and took the
name of Geertmen. The Geertmen were known by only one of the Greek
writers, Strabo, who mentions them as Germanes, differing totally
and entirely from the Brachmanes in manners, language, and religion.

The historians of Alexander's expeditions do not speak of Frisians
or Geertmen, though they mention Indoscythians, thereby describing
a people who live in India, but whose origin is in the distant,
unknown North.

In the accounts of Liudgert no names are given of places where the
Frieslanders lived in India. We only know that they first established
themselves to the east of the Punjab, and afterwards moved to the
west of those rivers. It is mentioned, moreover, as a striking
fact, that in the summer the sun at midday was straight above their
heads. They therefore lived within the tropics. We find in Ptolemy
(see the map of Kiepert), exactly 24 deg. N. on the west side of the Indus,
the name Minnagara; and about six degrees east of that, in 22 deg. N.,
another Minnagara. This name is pure Fries, the same as Walhallagara,
Folsgara, and comes from Minna, the name of an Eeremoeder, in whose
time the voyages of Teunis and his nephew Inca took place.

The coincidence is too remarkable to be accidental, and not to
prove that Minnagara was the headquarters of the Frisian colony. The
establishment of the colonists in the Punjab in 1551 before Christ,
and their journey thither, we find fully described in Adela's book;
and with the mention of one most remarkable circumstance, namely,
that the Frisian mariners sailed through the strait which in those
times still ran into the Red Sea.

In Strabo, book i. pages 38 and 50, it appears that Eratosthenes
was acquainted with the existence of the strait, of which the later
geographers make no mention. It existed still in the time of Moses
(Exodus xiv. 2), for he encamped at Pi-ha-chiroht, the "mouth of the
strait." Moreover, Strabo mentions that Sesostris made an attempt
to cut through the isthmus, but that he was not able to accomplish
it. That in very remote times the sea really did flow through is proved
by the result of the geological investigations on the isthmus made by
the Suez Canal Commission, of which M. Renaud presented a report to
the Academy of Sciences on the 19th June 1856. In that report, among
other things, appears the following: "Une question fort controversee
est celle de savoir, si a l'epoque ou les Hebreux fuyaient de l'Egypte
sous la conduite de Moise, les lacs amers faisaient encore partie
de la mer rouge. Cette derniere hypothese s'accorderait mieux que
l'hypothese contraire avec le texte des livres sacres, mais alors
il faudrait admettre que depuis l'epoque de Moise le seuil de Suez
serait sorti des eaux."

With regard to this question, it is certainly of importance to fall
in with an account in this Frisian manuscript, from which it seems
that in the sixteenth century before Christ the connection between
the Bitter Lakes and the Red Sea still existed, and that the strait
was still navigable. The manuscript further states that soon after
the passage of the Geertmen there was an earthquake; that the land
rose so high that all the water ran out, and all the shallows and
alluvial lands rose up like a wall. This must have happened after the
time of Moses, so that at the date of the Exodus (1564 B.C.) the track
between Suez and the Bitter Lakes was still navigable, but could be
forded dry-foot at low water.

This point, then, is the commencement of the isthmus, after the forming
of which, the northern inlet was certainly soon filled up as far as
the Gulf of Pelusium.

The map by Louis Figuier, in the "Annee scientifique et industrielle"
(premiere annee), Paris, Hachette, 1857, gives a distinct illustration
of the formation of this land.

Another statement, which occurs only in Strabo, finds also here a
confirmation. Strabo alone of all the Greek writers relates that
Nearchus, after he had landed his troops in the Persian Gulf, at the
mouth of the Pasitigris, sailed out of the Persian Gulf by Alexander's
command, and steered round Arabia through the Arabian Gulf. As
the account stands, it is not clear what Nearchus had to do there,
and what the object of the further voyage was. If, as Strabo seems
to think, it was only for geographical discovery, he need not have
taken the whole fleet. One or two ships would have sufficed. We do
not read that he returned. Where, then, did he remain with that fleet?

The answer to this question is to be found in the Frisian version of
the story. Alexander had bought the ships on the Indus, or had had
them built by the descendants of the Frisians who settled there--the
Geertmen--and had taken into his service sailors from among them, and
at the head of them was Friso. Alexander having accomplished his voyage
and the transport of his troops, had no further use for the ships in
the Persian Gulf, but wished to employ them in the Mediterranean. He
had taken that idea into his head, and it must be carried into
effect. He wished to do what no one had done before him. For this
purpose Nearchus was to sail up the Red Sea, and on his arrival at
Suez was to find 200 elephants, 1000 camels, workmen and materials,
timber and ropes, &c., in order to haul the ships by land over the
isthmus. This work was carried on and accomplished with so much zeal
and energy that after three months' labour the fleet was launched in
the Mediterranean. That the fleet really came to the Mediterranean
appears in Plutarch's "Life of Alexander;" but he makes Nearchus
bring the fleet round Africa, and sail through the Pillars of Hercules.

After the defeat at Actium, Cleopatra, in imitation of this example,
tried to take her fleet over the isthmus in order to escape to India,
but was prevented by the inhabitants of Arabia Petraea, who burnt her
ships. (See Plutarch's "Life of Antony.") When Alexander shortly
afterwards died, Friso remained in the service of Antigonus and
Demetrius, until, having been grievously insulted by the latter, he
resolved to seek out with his sailors their fatherland, Friesland. To
India he could not, indeed, return.

Thus these accounts chime in with and clear up each other, and in
that way afford a mutual confirmation of the events.

Such simple narratives and surprising results led me to conclude that
we had to do here with more than mere Saga and Legends.

Since the last twenty years attention has been directed to the
remains of the dwellings on piles, first observed in the Swiss lakes,
and afterwards in other parts of Europe. (See Dr E. Rueckert, "Die
Pfahlbauten;" Wuerzburg, 1869. Dr T. C. Winkler, in the "Volksalmanak,"
t. N. v. A. 1867.) When they were found, endeavours were made to
discover, by the existing fragments of arms, tools, and household
articles, by whom and when these dwellings had been inhabited. There
are no accounts of them in historical writers, beyond what Herodotus
writes in book v. chapter 16, of the "Paeonen." The only trace that
has been found is in one of the panels of Trajan's Pillar, in which
the destruction of a pile village in Dacia is represented.

Doubly important, therefore, is it to learn from the writing
of Apollonia that she, as "Burgtmaagd" (chief of the virgins),
about 540 years before Christ, made a journey up the Rhine to
Switzerland, and there became acquainted with the Lake Dwellers
(Marsaten). She describes their dwellings built upon piles--the
people themselves--their manners and customs. She relates that they
lived by fishing and hunting, and that they prepared the skins of the
animals with the bark of the birch-tree in order to sell the furs
to the Rhine boatmen, who brought them into commerce. This account
of the pile dwellings in the Swiss lakes can only have been written
in the time when these dwellings still existed and were lived in. In
the second part of the writing, Konered oera Linda relates that Adel,
the son of Friso (+-250 years before Christ), visited the pile dwellings
in Switzerland with his wife Ifkja.

Later than this account there is no mention by any writer whatever of
the pile dwellings, and the subject has remained for twenty centuries
utterly unknown until 1853, when an extraordinary low state of the
water led to the discovery of these dwellings. Therefore no one could
have invented this account in the intervening period. Although a great
portion of the first part of the work--the book of Adela--belongs to
the mythological period before the Trojan war, there is a striking
difference between it and the Greek myths. The Myths have no dates,
much less any chronology, nor any internal coherence of successive
events. The untrammelled fancy develops itself in every poem separately
and independently. The mythological stories contradict each other on
every point. "Les Mythes ne se tiennent pas," is the only key to the
Greek Mythology.

Here, on the contrary, we meet with a regular succession of dates
starting from a fixed period--the destruction of Atland, 2193
before Christ. The accounts are natural and simple, often naive,
never contradict each other, and are always consistent with each
other in time and place. As, for instance, the arrival and sojourn
of Ulysses with the Burgtmaagd Kalip at Walhallagara (Walcheren),
which is the most mythical portion of all, is here said to be 1005
years after the disappearance of Atland, which coincides with 1188
years before Christ, and thus agrees very nearly with the time at
which the Greeks say the Trojan war took place. The story of Ulysses
was not brought here for the first time by the Romans. Tacitus found
it already in Lower Germany (see "Germania," cap. 3), and says that
at Asciburgium there was an altar on which the names of Ulysses and
his father Laertes were inscribed.

Another remarkable difference consists in this, that the Myths know
no origin, do not name either writers or relaters of their stories,
and therefore never can bring forward any authority. Whereas in
Adela's book, for every statement is given a notice where it was
found or whence it was taken. For instance, "This comes from Minno's
writings--this is written on the walls of Waraburch--this in the town
of Frya--this at Stavia--this at Walhallagara."

There is also this further. Laws, regular legislative enactments, such
as are found in great numbers in Adela's book, are utterly unknown
in Mythology, and indeed are irreconcilable with its existence. Even
when the Myth attributes to Minos the introduction of lawgiving in
Crete, it does not give the least account of what the legislation
consisted in. Also among the Gods of Mythology there existed no system
of laws. The only law was unchangable Destiny and the will of the
supreme Zeus.

With regard to Mythology, this writing, which bears no
mythical character, is not less remarkable than with regard to
history. Notwithstanding the frequent and various relations with
Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, we do not find any traces of acquaintance
with the Northern or Scandinavian Mythology. Only Wodin appears in the
person of Wodan, a chief of the Frisians, who became the son-in-law
of one Magy, King of the Finns, and after his death was deified.

The Frisian religion is extremely simple, and pure Monotheism. Wr-alda
or Wr-alda's spirit is the only eternal, unchangeable, perfect, and
almighty being. Wr-alda has created everything. Out of him proceeds
everything--first the beginning, then time, and afterwards Irtha,
the Earth. Irtha bore three daughters--Lyda, Finda, and Frya--the
mothers of the three distinct races, black, yellow, and white--Africa,
Asia, and Europe. As such, Frya is the mother of Frya's people, the
Frieslanders. She is the representative of Wr-alda, and is reverenced
accordingly. Frya has established her "Tex," the first law, and has
established the religion of the eternal light. The worship consists in
the maintenance of a perpetually-burning lamp, foddik, by priestesses,
virgins. At the head of the virgins in every town was a Burgtmaagd,
and the chief of the Burgtmaagden was the Eeremoeder of the Fryasburgt
of Texland. The Eeremoeder governs the whole country. The kings can do
nothing, nor can anything happen without her advice and approval. The
first Eeremoeder was appointed by Frya herself, and was called
Fasta. In fact, we find here the prototype of the Roman Vestal Virgins.

We are reminded here of Velleda (Welda) and Aurinia in Tacitus
("Germania," 8. Hist., iv. 61, 65; v. 22, 24. "Annals," i. 54),
and of Gauna, the successor of Velleda, in Dio Cassius (Fragments,
49). Tacitus speaks of the town of Velleda as "edita turris," page
146. It was the town Mannagarda forda (Munster).

In the county of the Marsians he speaks of the temple Tanfane
(Tanfanc), so called from the sign of the Juul. (See plate I.)

The last of these towns was Fastaburgt in Ameland, temple Foste,
destroyed, according to Occa Scarlensis, in 806.

If we find among the Frisians a belief in a Godhead and ideas of
religion entirely different from the Mythology of other nations, we are
the more surprised to find in some points the closest connection with
the Greek and Roman Mythology, and even with the origin of two deities
of the highest rank, Min-erva and Neptune. Min-erva (Athene) was
originally a Burgtmaagd, priestess of Frya, at the town Walhallagara,
Middelburg, or Domburg, in Walcheren. And this Min-erva is at the
same time the mysterious enigmatical goddess of whose worship scarcely
any traces remain beyond the votive stones at Domburg, in Walcheren,
Nehallenia, of whom no mythology knows anything more than the name,
which etymology has used for all sorts of fantastical derivations. [2]

The other, Neptune, called by the Etrurians Nethunus, the God of
the Mediterranean Sea, appears here to have been, when living,
a Friesland Viking, or sea-king, whose home was Alderga (Ouddorp,
not far from Alkmaar). His name was Teunis, called familiarly by
his followers Neef Teunis, or Cousin Teunis, who had chosen the
Mediterranean as the destination of his expeditions, and must have
been deified by the Tyrians at the time when the Phenician navigators
began to extend their voyages so remarkably, sailing to Friesland in
order to obtain British tin, northern iron, and amber from the Baltic,
about 2000 years before Christ.

Besides these two we meet with a third mythological person--Minos,
the lawgiver of Crete, who likewise appears to have been a Friesland
sea-king, Minno, born at Lindaoord, between Wieringen and Kreyl,
who imparted to the Cretans an "Asagaboek." He is that Minos who,
with his brother Rhadamanthus and AEacus, presided as judges over the
fates of the ghosts in Hades, and must not be confounded with the
later Minos, the contemporary of AEgeus and Theseus, who appears in
the Athenian fables.

The reader may perhaps be inclined to laugh at these statements,
and apply to me the words that I myself have lately used, fantastic
and improbable. Indeed at first I could not believe my own eyes,
and yet after further consideration I arrived at the discovery of
extraordinary conformities which render the case much less improbable
than the birth of Min-erva from the head of Jupiter by a blow from
the axe of Hephaestus, for instance.

In the Greek Mythology all the gods and goddesses have a youthful
period. Pallas alone has no youth. She is not otherwise known than
adult. Min-erva appears in Attica as high priestess from a foreign
country, a country unknown to the Greeks. Pallas is a virgin goddess,
Min-erva is a Burgtmaagd. The fair, blue-eyed Pallas, differing thus
in type from the rest of the gods and goddesses, evidently belonged
to Frya's people. The character for wisdom and the emblematical
attributes, especially the owl, are the same for both. Pallas
gives to the new town her own name, Athenai, which has no meaning
in Greek. Min-erva gives to the town built by her the name Athene,
which has an important meaning in Fries, namely, that they came there
as friends--"Athen."

Min-erva came to Attica about 1600 years before Christ, the period
at which the Grecian Mythology was beginning to be formed. Min-erva
landed with the fleet of Jon at the head of a colony in Attica. In
later times we find her on the Roman votive stones in Walcheren,
under the name of Nehallenia, worshipped as a goddess of navigation;
and Pallas is worshipped by the Athenians as the protecting goddess
of shipbuilding and navigation.

Time is the carrier who must eternally turn the "Jol" (wheel) and
carry the sun along his course through the firmament from winter
to winter, thus forming the year, every turn of the wheel being a
day. In midwinter the "Jolfeest" is celebrated on Frya's Day. Then
cakes are baked in the form of the sun's wheel, because with the Jol
Frya formed the letters when she wrote her "Tex." The Jolfeest is
therefore also in honour of Frya as inventor of writing.

Just as this Jolfeest has been changed by Christianity into
Christmas throughout Denmark and Germany, and into St Nicholas' Day
in Holland; so, certainly, our St Nicholas' dolls--the lover and his
sweetheart--are a memorial of Frya, and the St Nicholas letters a
memorial of Frya's invention of letters formed from the wheel.

I cannot analyse the whole contents of this writing, and must content
myself with the remarks that I have made. They will give an idea of the
richness and importance of the contents. If some of it is fabulous,
even as fabulous it must have an interest for us, since so little of
the traditions of our forefathers remains to us.

An internal evidence of the antiquity of these writings may be
found in the fact that the name Batavians had not yet been used. The
inhabitants of the whole country as far as the Scheldt are Frya's
people--Frieslanders. The Batavians are not a separate people. The
name Batavi is of Roman origin. The Romans gave it to the inhabitants
of the banks of the Waal, which river bears the name Patabus in the
"Tabula Pentingeriana." The name Batavi does not appear earlier than
Tacitus and Pliny, and is interpolated in Caesar's "Bello Gallico,"
iv. 10. (See my treatise on the course of the rivers through the
countries of the Frisians and Batavians, p. 49, in "De Vrije Fries,"
4th vol. 1st part, 1845.)

I will conclude with one more remark regarding the language. Those
who have been able to take only a superficial view of the manuscript
have been struck by the polish of the language, and its conformity
with the present Friesland language and Dutch. In this they seem to
find grounds for doubting the antiquity of the manuscript.

But, I ask, is, then, the language of Homer much less polished than
that of Plato or Demosthenes? And does not the greatest portion of
Homer's vocabulary exist in the Greek of our day?

It is true that language alters with time, and is continually subject
to slight variations, owing to which language is found to be different
at different epochs. This change in the language in this manuscript
accordingly gives ground for important observations to philologists. It
is not only that of the eight writers who have successively worked
at the book, each is recognisable by slight peculiarities in style,
language, and spelling; but more particularly between the two parts
of the book, between which an interval of more than two centuries
occurs, a striking difference of the language is visible, which
shows what a slowly progressive regulation it has undergone in that
period of time. As the result of these considerations, I arrive at the
conclusion that I cannot find any reason to doubt the authenticity of
these writings. They cannot be forgeries. In the first place, the copy
of 1256 cannot be. Who could at that time have forged anything of that
kind? Certainly no one. Still less any one at an earlier date. At a
later date a forgery is equally impossible, for the simple reason that
no one was acquainted with the language. Except Grimm, Richthofen,
and Hettema, no one can be named sufficiently versed in that branch
of philology, or who had studied the language so as to be able to
write in it. And if any one could have done so, there would have been
no more extensive vocabulary at his service than that which the East
Frisian laws afford. Therefore, in the centuries lately elapsed, the
preparation of this writing was quite impossible. Whoever doubts this
let him begin by showing where, when, by whom, and with what object
such a forgery could be committed, and let him show in modern times
the fellow of this paper, this writing, and this language.

Moreover, that the manuscript of 1256 is not original, but is a copy,
is proved by the numerous faults in the writing, as well as by some
explanations of words which already in the time of the copyist had
become obsolete and little known, as, for instance, in page 82 (114),
"to thera flete jefta bedrum;" page 151 (204), "bargum jefta tonnum
fon tha besta bjar."

A still stronger proof is that between pages 157 and 158 one or more
pages are missing, which cannot have been lost out of this manuscript,
because the pages 157 and 158 are on the front and the back of the
same leaf.

Page 157 finishes thus: "Three months afterwards Adel sent messengers
to all the friends that he had gained, and requested them to send
him intelligent people in the month of May." When we turn over the
leaf, the other side begins, "his wife, he said, who had been Maid
of Texland, had got a copy of it."

There is no connection between these two. There is wanting, at least,
the arrival of the invited, and an account of what passed at their
meeting. It is clear, therefore, that the copyist must have turned
over two pages of the original instead of one. There certainly existed
then an earlier manuscript, and that was doubtless written by Liko
oera Linda in the year 803.

We may thus accept that we possess in this manuscript, of which
the first part was composed in the sixth century before our era, the
oldest production, after Homer and Hesiod, of European literature, And
here we find in our fatherland a very ancient people in possession of
development, civilization, industry, navigation, commerce, literature,
and pure elevated ideas of religion, whose existence we had never even
conjectured. Hitherto we have believed that the historical records
of our people reach no farther back than the arrival of Friso the
presumptive founder of the Frisians, whereas here we become aware
that these records mount up to more than 2000 years before Christ,
surpassing the antiquity of Hellas and equalling that of Israel.

    February. 1871.

OKKE MY SON--


You must preserve these books with body and soul. They contain the
history of all our people, as well as of our forefathers. Last year
I saved them in the flood, as well as you and your mother; but they
got wet, and therefore began to perish. In order not to lose them,
I copied them on foreign paper.

In case you inherit them, you must copy them likewise, and your
children must do so too, so that they may never be lost.

reckoning, the year 1256. Hiddo, surnamed Over de Linda.--Watch.



Beloved successors, for the sake of our dear forefathers, and of our
dear liberty, I entreat you a thousand times never let the eye of
a monk look on these writings. They are very insinuating, but they
destroy in an underhand manner all that relates to us Frisians. In
order to gain rich benefices, they conspire with foreign kings, who
know that we are their greatest enemies, because we dare to speak to
their people of liberty, rights, and the duties of princes. Therefore
they seek to destroy all that we derive from our forefathers, and
all that is left of our old customs.

Ah, my beloved ones! I have visited their courts! If Wr-alda permits
it, and we do not shew ourselves strong to resist, they will altogether
exterminate us.

THE BOOK OF ADELA'S FOLLOWERS.


Thirty years after the day on which the Volksmoeder was murdered by
the commander Magy, was a time of great distress. All the states that
lie on the other side of the Weser had been wrested from us, and had
fallen under the power of Magy, and it looked as if his power was to
become supreme over the whole land. To avert this misfortune a general
assembly of the people was summoned, which was attended by all the
men who stood in good repute with the Maagden (priestesses). Then at
the end of three days the whole council was in confusion, and in the
same position as when they came together. Thereupon Adela demanded
to be heard, and said:--

You all know that I was three years Burgtmaagd. You know also that
I was chosen for Volksmoeder, and that I refused to be Volksmoeder
because I wished to marry Apol; but what you do not know is, that I
have watched everything that has happened, as if I had really been
your Volksmoeder. I have constantly travelled about, observing what
was going on. By that means I have become acquainted with many things
that others do not know. You said yesterday that our relatives on
the other side of the Weser were dull and cowardly; but I may tell
you that the Magy has not won a single village from them by force of
arms; but only by detestable deceit, and still more by the rapacity
of their dukes and nobles.

Frya has said we must not admit amongst us any but free people; but
what have they done? They have imitated our enemies, and instead of
killing their prisoners, or letting them go free, they have despised
the counsel of Frya, and have made slaves of them.

Because they have acted thus, Frya cared no longer to watch over
them. They robbed others of their freedom, and therefore lost
their own.

This is well known to you, but I will tell you how they came to sink
so low. The Finn women had children. These grew up with our free
children. They played and gamboled together in the fields, and were
also together by the hearth.

There they learned with pleasure the loose ways of the Finns, because
they were bad and new; and thus they became denationalised in spite of
the efforts of their parents. When the children grew up, and saw that
the children of the Finns handled no weapons, and scarcely worked,
they took a distaste for work, and became proud.

The principal men and their cleverest sons made up to the wanton
daughters of the Finns; and their own daughters, led astray by this bad
example, allowed themselves to be beguiled by the handsome young Finns
in derision of their depraved fathers. When the Magy found this out,
he took the handsomest of his Finns and Magyars, and promised them
"red cows with golden horns" to let themselves be taken prisoners
by our people in order to spread his doctrines. His people did even
more. Children disappeared, were taken away to the uplands, and after
they had been brought up in his pernicious doctrines, were sent back.

When these pretended prisoners had learned our language, they
persuaded the dukes and nobles that they should become subject to the
Magy--that then their sons would succeed to them without having to
be elected. Those who by their good deeds had gained a piece of land
in front of their house, they promised on their side should receive
in addition a piece behind; those who had got a piece before and
behind, should have a rondeel (complete circuit); and those who had
a rondeel should have a whole freehold. If the seniors were true to
Frya, then they changed their course, and turned to the degenerate
sons. Yesterday there were among you those who would have called
the whole people together, to compel the eastern states to return to
their duty. According to my humble opinion, they would have made a
great mistake. Suppose that there was a very serious epidemic among
the cattle, would you run the risk of sending your own healthy cattle
among the sick ones? Certainly not. Every one must see that doing
that would turn out very badly for the whole of the cattle. Who, then,
would be so imprudent as to send their children among a people wholly
depraved? If I were to give you any advice, it would be to choose a
new Volksmoeder. I know that you are in a difficulty about it, because
out of the thirteen Burgtmaagden that we still have remaining, eight
are candidates for the dignity; but I should pay no attention to that.

Teuntia, the Burgtmaagd of Medeasblik, who is not a candidate, is a
person of knowledge and sound sense, and quite as attached to our
people and our customs as all the rest together. I should farther
recommend that you should visit all the citadels, and write down all
the laws of Frya's Tex, as well as all the histories, and all that
is written on the walls, in order that it may not be destroyed with
the citadels.

It stands written that every Volksmoeder and every Burgtmaagd
shall have assistants and messengers--twenty-one maidens and seven
apprentices.

If I might add more, I would recommend that all the respectable girls
in the towns should be taught; for I say positively, and time will
show it, that if you wish to remain true children of Frya, never to
be vanquished by fraud or arms, you must take care to bring up your
daughters as true Frya's daughters.

You must teach the children how great our country has been, what
great men our forefathers were, how great we still are, if we compare
ourselves to others.

You must tell them of the sea-heroes, of their mighty deeds and
distant voyages. All these stories must be told by the fireside and
in the field, wherever it may be, in times of joy or sorrow; and if
you wish to impress it on the brains and the hearts of your sons,
you must let it flow through the lips of your wives and your daughters.

Adela's advice was followed.

These are the Grevetmen under whose direction this book is composed:--

Apol, Adela's husband; three times a sea-king; Grevetman of Ostflyland
and Lindaoorden. The towns Liudgarda, Lindahem, and Stavia are under
his care.

The Saxman Storo, Sytia's husband; Grevetman over the Hoogefennen and
Wouden. Nine times he was chosen as duke or heerman (commander). The
towns Buda and Manna-garda-forda are under his care.

Abelo, Jaltia's husband; Grevetman over the Zuiderfly-landen. He was
three times heerman. The towns Aken, Liudburg, and Katsburg are under
his care.

Enoch, Dywcke's husband; Grevetman over Westflyland and Texel. He
was chosen nine times for sea-king. Waraburg, Medeasblik, Forana,
and Fryasburg are under his care.

Foppe, Dunroo's husband; Grevetman over the seven islands. He was
five times sea-king. The town Walhallagara is under his care.

This was inscribed upon the walls of Fryasburg in Texland, as well
as at Stavia and Medeasblik.

It was Frya's day, and seven times seven years had elapsed since
Festa was appointed Volksmoeder by the desire of Frya. The citadel of
Medeasblik was ready, and a Burgtmaagd was chosen. Festa was about to
light her new lamp, and when she had done so in the presence of all
the people, Frya called from her watch-star, so that every one could
hear it: "Festa, take your style and write the things, that I may not
speak." Festa did as she was bid, and thus we became Frya's children,
and our earliest history began.

This is our earliest history.

Wr-alda, who alone is eternal and good, made the beginning. Then
commenced time. Time wrought all things, even the earth. The earth
bore grass, herbs, and trees, all useful and all noxious animals. All
that is good and useful she brought forth by day, and all that is
bad and injurious by night.

After the twelfth Juulfeest she brought forth three maidens:--

Lyda out of fierce heat.

Finda out of strong heat.

Frya out of moderate heat.

When the last came into existence, Wr-alda breathed his spirit upon
her in order that men might be bound to him. As soon as they were
full grown they took pleasure and delight in the visions of Wr-alda.

Hatred found its way among them.

They each bore twelve sons and twelve daughters--at every Juul-time
a couple. Thence come all mankind.

Lyda was black, with hair curled like a lamb's; her eyes shone like
stars, and shot out glances like those of a bird of prey.

Lyda was acute. She could hear a snake glide, and could smell a fish
in the water.

Lyda was strong and nimble. She could bend a large tree, yet when
she walked she did not bruise a flower-stalk.

Lyda was violent. Her voice was loud, and when she screamed in anger
every creature quailed.

Wonderful Lyda! She had no regard for laws; her actions were governed
by her passions. To help the weak she would kill the strong, and when
she had done it she would weep by their bodies.

Poor Lyda! She turned grey by her mad behaviour, and at last she died
heart-broken by the wickedness of her children. Foolish children! They
accused each other of their mother's death. They howled and fought
like wolves, and while they did this the birds devoured the corpse. Who
can refrain from tears at such a recital?

Finda was yellow, and her hair was like the mane of a horse. She
could not bend a tree, but where Lyda killed one lion she killed ten.

Finda was seductive. Her voice was sweeter than any bird's. Her
eyes were alluring and enticing, but whoever looked upon them became
her slave.

Finda was unreasonable. She wrote thousands of laws, but she never
obeyed one. She despised the frankness of the good, and gave herself
up to flatterers.

That was her misfortune. Her head was too full, but her heart was too
vain. She loved nobody but herself, and she wished that all should
love her.

False Finda! Honey-sweet were her words, but those who trusted them
found sorrow at hand.

Selfish Finda! She wished to rule everybody, and her sons were like
her. They made their sisters serve them, and they slew each other
for the mastery.

Treacherous Finda! One wrong word would irritate her, and the
cruellest deeds did not affect her. If she saw a lizard swallow a
spider, she shuddered; but if she saw her children kill a Frisian,
her bosom swelled with pleasure.

Unfortunate Finda! She died in the bloom of her age, and the mode of
her death is unknown.

Hypocritical children! Her corpse was buried under a costly stone,
pompous inscriptions were written on it, and loud lamentations were
heard at it, but in private not a tear was shed.

Despicable people! The laws that Finda established were written
on golden tables, but the object for which they were made was never
attained. The good laws were abolished, and selfishness instituted bad
ones in their place. O Finda! then the earth overflowed with blood,
and your children were mown down like grass. Yes, Finda! those were
the fruits of your vanity. Look down from your watch-star and weep.

Frya was white like the snow at sunrise, and the blue of her eyes
vied with the rainbow.

Beautiful Frya! Like the rays of the sun shone the locks of her hair,
which were as fine as spiders' webs.

Clever Frya! When she opened her lips the birds ceased to sing and
the leaves to quiver.

Powerful Frya! At the glance of her eye the lion lay down at her feet
and the adder withheld his poison.

Pure Frya! Her food was honey, and her beverage was dew gathered from
the cups of the flowers.

Sensible Frya! The first lesson that she taught her children was
self-control, and the second was the love of virtue; and when they
were grown she taught them the value of liberty; for she said,
"Without liberty all other virtues serve to make you slaves, and to
disgrace your origin."

Generous Frya! She never allowed metal to be dug from the earth for
her own benefit, but when she did it it was for the general use.

Most happy Frya! Like the starry host in the firmament, her children
clustered around her.

Wise Frya! When she had seen her children reach the seventh generation,
she summoned them all to Flyland, and there gave them her Tex, saying,
"Let this be your guide, and it can never go ill with you."

Exalted Frya! When she had thus spoken the earth shook like the sea
of Wr-alda. The ground of Flyland sunk beneath her feet, the air
was dimmed by tears, and when they looked for their mother she was
already risen to her watching star; then at length thunder burst from
the clouds, and the lightning wrote upon the firmament "Watch!"

Far-seeing Frya! The land from which she had risen was now a stream,
and except her Tex all that was in it was overwhelmed.

Obedient children! When they came to themselves again, they made
this high mound and built this citadel upon it, and on the walls
they wrote the Tex, and that every one should be able to find it they
called the land about it Texland. Therefore it shall remain as long
as the earth shall be the earth.






FRYA'S TEX.


Prosperity awaits the free. At last they shall see me again. Through
him only can I recognise as free who is neither a slave to another
nor to himself. This is my counsel:--

1. When in dire distress, and when mental and physical energy avail
nothing, then have recourse to the spirit of Wr-alda; but do not
appeal to him before you have tried all other means, for I tell you
beforehand, and time will prove its truth, that those who give way
to discouragement sink under their burdens.

2. To Wr-alda's spirit only shall you bend the knee in
gratitude--thricefold--for what you have received, for what you do
receive, and for the hope of aid in time of need.

3. You have seen how speedily I have come to your assistance. Do
likewise to your neighbour, but wait not for his entreaties. The
suffering would curse you, my maidens would erase your name from the
book, and I would regard you as a stranger.

4. Let not your neighbour express his thanks to you on bended knee,
which is only due to Wr-alda's spirit. Envy would assail you, Wisdom
would ridicule you, and my maidens would accuse you of irreverence.

5. Four things are given for your enjoyment--air, water, land, and
fire--but Wr-alda is the sole possessor of them. Therefore my counsel
to you is, choose upright men who will fairly divide the labour and
the fruits, so that no man shall be exempt from work or from the duty
of defence.

6. If ever it should happen that one of your people should sell his
freedom, he is not of you, he is a bastard. I counsel you to expel him
and his mother from the land. Repeat this to your children morning,
noon, and night, till they think of it in their dreams.

7. If any man shall deprive another, even his debtor, of his liberty,
let him be to you as a vile slave; and I advise you to burn his body
and that of his mother in an open place, and bury them fifty feet
below the ground, so that no grass shall grow upon them. It would
poison your cattle.

8. Meddle not with the people of Lyda, nor of Finda, because Wr-alda
would help them, and any injury that you inflicted on them would
recoil upon your own heads.

9. If it should happen that they come to you for advice or assistance,
then it behoves you to help them; but if they should rob you, then
fall upon them with fire and sword.

10. If any of them should seek a daughter of yours to wife, and she is
willing, explain to her her folly; but if she will follow her lover,
let her go in peace.

11. If your son wishes for a daughter of theirs, do the same as to your
daughter; but let not either one or the other ever return among you,
for they would introduce foreign morals and customs, and if these
were accepted by you, I could no longer watch over you.

12. Upon my servant Fasta I have placed all my hopes. Therefore
you must choose her for Eeremoeder. Follow my advice, then she will
hereafter remain my servant as well as all the sacred maidens who
succeed her. Then shall the lamp which I have lighted for you never be
extinguished. Its brightness shall always illuminate your intellect,
and you shall always remain as free from foreign domination as your
fresh river-water is distinct from the salt sea.






THIS HAS FASTA SPOKEN.


All the regulations which have existed a century, that is, a hundred
years, may by the advice of the Eeremoeder, with the consent of
the community, be inscribed upon the walls of the citadel, and when
inscribed on the walls they become laws, and it is our duty to respect
them all. If by force or necessity any regulations should be imposed
upon us at variance with our laws and customs, we must submit; but
should we be released, we must always return to our own again. That
is Frya's will, and must be that of all her children.






FASTA SAID--


Anything that any man commences, whatever it may be, on the day
appointed for Frya's worship shall eternally fail, for time has
proved that she was right; and it is become a law that no man shall,
except from absolute necessity, keep that day otherwise than as a
joyful feast.






THESE ARE THE LAWS ESTABLISHED FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CITADELS.


1. Whenever a citadel is built, the lamp belonging to it must be
lighted at the original lamp in Texland, and that can only be done
by the mother.

2. Every mother shall appoint her own maidens. She may even choose
those who are mothers in other towns.

3. The mother of Texland may appoint her own successor, but should
she die without having done so, the election shall take place at a
general assembly of the whole nation.

4. The mother of Texland may have twenty-one maidens and seven
assistants, so that there may always be seven to attend the lamp day
and night. She may have the same number of maidens who are mothers
in other towns.

5. If a maiden wishes to marry, she must announce it to the mother,
and immediately resign her office, before her passion shall have
polluted the light.

6. For the service of the mother and of each of the Burgtmaidens
there shall be appointed twenty-one townsmen--seven civilians of
mature years, seven warriors of mature years, and seven seamen of
mature years.

7. Out of the seven three shall retire every year, and shall not be
replaced by members of their own family nearer than the fourth degree.

8. Each may have three hundred young townsmen as defenders.

9. For this service they must study Frya's Tex and the laws. From
the sages they must learn wisdom, from the warriors the art of war,
and from the sea-kings the skill required for distant voyages.

10. Every year one hundred of the defenders shall return to their
homes, and those that may have been wounded shall remain in the
citadels.

11. At the election of the defenders no burgher or Grevetman, or
other person of distinction, shall vote, but only the people.

12. The mother at Texland shall have three times seven active
messengers, and three times twelve speedy horses. In the other citadels
each maiden shall have three messengers and seven horses.

13. Every citadel shall have fifty agriculturists chosen by the people,
but only those may be chosen who are not strong enough to go to war
or to go to sea.

14. Every citadel must provide for its own sustenance, and must
maintain its own defences, and look after its share of the general
contributions.

15. If a man is chosen to fill any office and refuses to serve, he
can never become a burgher, nor have any vote. And if he is already
a burgher, he shall cease to be so.

16. If any man wishes to consult the mother or a Burgtmaid, he must
apply to the secretary, who will take him to the Burgtmaster. He
will then be examined by a surgeon to see if he is in good health. If
he is passed, he shall lay aside his arms, and seven warriors shall
present him to the mother.

17. If the affair concerns only one district, he must bring forward not
less than three witnesses; but if it affects the whole of Friesland,
he must have twenty-one additional witnesses, in order to guard
against any deceptions.

18. Under all circumstances the mother must take care that her
children, that is, Frya's people, shall remain as temperate as
possible. This is her most important duty, and it is the duty of all
of us to help her in performing it.

19. If she is called upon to decide any judicial question between
a Grevetman and the community, she must incline towards the side of
the community in order to maintain peace, and because it is better
that one man should suffer than many.

20. If any one comes to the mother for advice, and she is prepared
to give it, she must do it immediately. If she does not know what to
advise, he must remain waiting seven days; and if she then is unable
to advise, he must go away without complaining, for it is better to
have no advice at all than bad advice.

21. If a mother shall have given bad advice out of ill will, she must
be killed or driven out of the land, deprived of everything.

22. If her Burgtheeren are accomplices, they are to be treated in a
similar manner.

23. If her guilt is doubtful or only suspected, it must be considered
and debated, if necessary, for twenty-one weeks. If half the votes
are against her, she must be declared innocent. If two-thirds are
against her, she must wait a whole year. If the votes are then the
same, she must be considered guilty, but may not be put to death.

24. If any of the one-third who have voted for her wish to go away
with her, they may depart with all their live and dead stock, and
shall not be the less considered, since the majority may be wrong as
well as the minority.






UNIVERSAL LAW.


1. All free-born men are equal, wherefore they must all have equal
rights on sea and land, and on all that Wr-alda has given.

2. Every man may seek the wife of his choice, and every woman may
bestow her hand on him whom she loves.

3. When a man takes a wife, a house and yard must be given to him. If
there is none, one must be built for him.

4. If he has taken a wife in another village, and wishes to remain,
they must give him a house there, and likewise the free use of
the common.

5. To every man must be given a piece of land behind his house. No
man shall have land in front of his house, still less an enclosure,
unless he has performed some public service. In such a case it may be
given, and the youngest son may inherit it, but after him it returns
to the community.

6. Every village shall possess a common for the general good, and the
chief of the village shall take care that it is kept in good order,
so that posterity shall find it uninjured.

7. Every village shall have a market-place. All the rest of the land
shall be for tillage and forest. No one shall fell trees without the
consent of the community, or without the knowledge of the forester;
for the forests are general property, and no man can appropriate them.

8. The market charges shall not exceed one-twelfth of the value of
the goods either to natives or strangers. The portion taken for the
charges shall not be sold before the other goods.

9. All the market receipts must be divided yearly into a hundred
parts three days before the Juul-day.

10. The Grevetman and his council shall take twenty parts; the keeper
of the market ten, and his assistants five; the Volksmoeder one,
the midwife four, the village ten, and the poor and infirm shall have
fifty parts.

11. There shall be no usurers in the market.

If any should come, it will be the duty of the maidens to make it
known through the whole land, in order that such people may not be
chosen for any office, because they are hard-hearted.

For the sake of money they would betray everybody--the people, the
mother, their nearest relations, and even their own selves.

12. If any man should attempt to sell diseased cattle or damaged
goods for sound, the market-keeper shall expel him, and the maidens
shall proclaim him through the country.

In early times almost all the Finns lived together in their native
land, which was called Aldland, and is now submerged. They were thus
far away, and we had no wars. When they were driven hitherwards, and
appeared as robbers, then arose the necessity of defending ourselves,
and we had armies, kings, and wars.

For all this there were established regulations, and out of the
regulations came fixed laws.






HERE FOLLOW THE LAWS WHICH WERE THUS ESTABLISHED.


1. Every Frisian must resist the assailants with such weapons as he
can procure, invent, and use.

2. When a boy is twelve years old he must devote one day in seven to
learning how to use his weapons.

3. As soon as he is perfect in the use of them they are to be given
to him, and he is to be admitted as a warrior.

4. After serving as a warrior three years, he may become a citizen,
and may have a vote in the election of the headman.

5. When he has been seven years a voter he then may have a vote for
the chief or king, and may be himself elected.

6. Every year he must be re-elected.

7. Except the king, all other officials are re-eligible who act
according to Frya's laws.

8. No king may be in office more than three years, in order that the
office may not be permanent.

9. After an interval of seven years he may be elected again.

10. If the king is killed by the enemy, his nearest relative may be
a candidate to succeed him.

11. If he dies a natural death, or if his period of service has
expired, he shall not be succeeded by any blood relation nearer than
the fourth degree.

12. Those who fight with arms are not men of counsel, therefore no
king must bear arms. His wisdom must be his weapon, and the love of
his warriors his shield.






THESE ARE THE RIGHTS OF THE MOTHERS AND THE KINGS.


1. If war breaks out, the mother sends her messengers to the king,
who sends messengers to the Grevetmen to call the citizens to arms.

2. The Grevetmen call all the citizens together and decide how many
men shall be sent.

3. All the resolutions must immediately be sent to the mother by
messengers and witnesses.

4. The mother considers all the resolutions and decides upon them,
and with this the king as well as the people must be satisfied.

5. When in the field, the king consults only his superior officers, but
three citizens of the mother must be present, without any voice. These
citizens must send daily reports to the mother, that they may be sure
nothing is done contrary to the counsels of Frya.

6. If the king wishes to do anything which his council opposes,
he may not persist in it.

7. If an enemy appears unexpectedly, then the king's orders must
be obeyed.

8. If the king is not present, the next to him takes command, and so
on in succession according to rank.

9. If there is no leader present, one must be chosen.

10. If there is no time to choose, any one may come forward who feels
himself capable of leading.

11. If a king has conquered a dangerous enemy, his successors may take
his name after their own. The king may, if he wishes, choose an open
piece of ground for a house and ground; the ground shall be enclosed,
and may be so large that there shall be seven hundred steps to the
boundary in all directions from the house.

12. His youngest son may inherit this, and that son's youngest son
after him; then it shall return to the community.






HERE ARE THE RULES ESTABLISHED FOR THE SECURITY OF ALL FRISIANS.


1. Whenever new laws are made or new regulations established, they
must be for the common good, and not for individual advantage.

2. Whenever in time of war either ships or houses are destroyed,
either by the enemy or as a matter of precaution, a general levy
shall be assessed on the people to make it good again, so that no
one may neglect the general welfare to preserve his own interest.

3. At the conclusion of a war, if any men are so severely wounded as
to be unable to work, they shall be maintained at the public expense,
and shall have the best seats at festivals, in order that the young
may learn to honour them.

4. If there are widows and orphans, they shall likewise be maintained
at the public expense; and the sons may inscribe the names of their
fathers on their shields for the honour of their families.

5. If any who have been taken prisoners should return, they must be
kept separate from the camp, because they may have obtained their
liberty by making treacherous promises, and thus they may avoid
keeping their promises without forfeiting their honour.

6. If any enemies be taken prisoners, they must be sent to the interior
of the country, that they may learn our free customs.

7. If they are afterwards set free, it must be done with kindness
by the maidens, in order that we may make them comrades and friends,
instead of haters and enemies.






FROM MINNO'S WRITINGS.


If any one should be so wicked as to commit robbery, murder, arson,
rape, or any other crime, upon a neighbouring state, and our people
wish to inflict punishment, the culprit shall be put to death in
the presence of the offended, in order that no war may arise, and
the innocent suffer for the guilty. If the offended will spare his
life and forego their revenge, it may be permitted. If the culprit
should be a king, Grevetman, or other person in authority, we must
make good his fault, but he must be punished.

If he bears on his shield the honourable name of his forefathers,
his kinsmen shall no longer wear it, in order that every man may look
after the conduct of his relatives.






LAWS FOR THE NAVIGATORS.

Navigator is the title of those who make foreign voyages.


1. All Frya's sons have equal rights, and every stalwart youth may
offer himself as a navigator to the Olderman, who may not refuse him
as long as there is any vacancy.

2. The navigators may choose their own masters.

3. The traders must be chosen and named by the community to which
they belong, and the navigators have no voice in their election.

4. If during a voyage it is found that the king is bad or incompetent,
another may be put in his place, and on the return home he may make
his complaint to the Olderman.

5. If the fleet returns with profits, the sailors may divide one-third
among themselves in the following manner: The king twelve portions,
the admiral seven, the boatswains each two portions, the captains
three, and the rest of the crew each one part; the youngest boys
each one-third of a portion, the second boys half a portion each,
and the eldest boys two-thirds of a portion each.

6. If any have been disabled, they must be maintained at the public
expense, and honoured in the same way as the soldiers.

7. If any have died on the voyage, their nearest relatives inherit
their portion.

8. Their widows and orphans must be maintained at the public expense;
and if they were killed in a sea-fight, their sons may bear the names
of their fathers on their shields.

9. If a topsailman is lost, his heirs shall receive a whole portion.

10. If he was betrothed, his bride may claim seven portions in order
to erect a monument to her bridegroom, but then she must remain a
widow all her life.

11. If the community is fitting out a fleet, the purveyors must provide
the best provisions for the voyage, and for the women and children.

12. If a sailor is worn out and poor, and has no house or patrimony,
one must be given him. If he does not wish for a house, his friends
may take him home; and the community must bear the expense, unless
his friends decline to receive it.






USEFUL EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS LEFT BY MINNO.


Minno was an ancient sea-king. He was a seer and a philosopher, and
he gave laws to the Cretans. He was born at Lindaoord, and after all
his wanderings he had the happiness to die at Lindahem.

If our neighbours have a piece of land or water which it would be
advantageous for us to possess, it is proper that we should offer to
buy it. If they refuse to sell it, we must let them keep it. This is
Frya's Tex, and it would be unjust to act contrary to it.

If any of our neighbours quarrel and fight about any matter except
land, and they request us to arbitrate, our best course will be
to decline; but if they insist upon it, it must be done honourably
and justly.

If any one comes and says, I am at war, you must help me; or another
comes and says, My son is an infant and incompetent, and I am old,
so I wish you to be his guardian, and to take charge of my property
until he is of age, it is proper to refuse in order that we may not
come into disputes about matters foreign to our free customs.

Whenever a foreign trader comes to the open markets at Wyringen and
Almanland, if he cheats, he must immediately be fined, and it must
be published by the maidens throughout the whole country.

If he should come back, no one must deal with him. He must return as
he came.

Whenever traders are chosen to go to trading stations, or to sail
with the fleets, they must be well known and of good reputation with
the maidens.

If, however, a bad man should by chance be chosen and should try to
cheat, the others are bound to remove him. If he should have committed
a cheat, it must be made good, and the culprit must be banished from
the land in order that our name may be everywhere held in honour.

If we should be ill-treated in a foreign market, whether distant or
near, we must immediately attack them; for though we desire to be at
peace, we must not let our neighbours underrate us or think that we
are afraid.

In my youth I often grumbled at the strictness of the laws, but
afterwards I learned to thank Frya for her Tex and our forefathers
for the laws which they established upon it. Wr-alda or Alvader has
given me many years, and I have travelled over many lands and seas,
and after all that I have seen, I am convinced that we alone are
chosen by Alvader to have laws. Lyda's people can neither make laws
nor obey them, they are too stupid and uncivilised. Many are like
Finda. They are clever enough, but they are too rapacious, haughty,
false, immoral, and bloodthirsty.

The toad blows himself out, but he can only crawl. The frog cries
"Work, work;" but he can do nothing but hop and make himself
ridiculous. The raven cries "Spare, spare;" but he steals and wastes
everything that he gets into his beak.

Finda's people are just like these. They say a great deal about
making good laws, and every one wishes to make regulations against
misconduct, but does not wish to submit to them himself. Whoever is
the most crafty crows over the others, and tries to make them submit
to him, till another comes who drives him off his perch.

The word "Eva" is too sacred for common use, therefore men have
learned to say "Evin."

"Eva" means that sentiment which is implanted in the breast of every
man in order that he may know what is right and what is wrong, and by
which he is able to judge his own deeds and those of others; that is,
if he has been well and properly brought up. "Eva" has also another
meaning; that is, tranquil, smooth, like water that is not stirred by a
breath of wind. If the water is disturbed it becomes troubled, uneven,
but it always has a tendency to return to its tranquil condition. That
is its nature, just as the inclination towards justice and freedom
exists in Frya's children. We derive this disposition from the spirit
of our father Wr-alda, which speaks strongly in Frya's children,
and will eternally remain so. Eternity is another symbol of Wr-alda,
who remains always just and unchangeable.

Eternal and unalterable are the signs wisdom and rectitude, which
must be sought after by all pious people, and must be possessed by
all judges. If, therefore, it is desired to make laws and regulations
which shall be permanent, they must be equal for all men. The judges
must pronounce their decisions according to these laws. If any crime
is committed respecting which no law has been made, a general assembly
of the people shall be called, where judgment shall be pronounced in
accordance with the inspiration of Wr-alda's spirit. If we act thus,
our judgment will never fail to be right.

If instead of doing right, men will commit wrong, there will arise
quarrels and differences among people and states. Thence arise civil
wars, and everything is thrown into confusion and destroyed; and,
O foolish people! while you are injuring each other the spiteful
Finda's people with their false priests come and attack your ports,
ravish your daughters, corrupt your morals, and at last throw the
bonds of slavery over every freeman's neck.






FROM MINNO'S WRITINGS.


When Nyhalennia, whose real name was Min-erva, was well established,
and the Krekalanders loved her as well as our own people did, there
came some princes and priests to her citadel and asked Min-erva, where
her possessions lay. Hellenia answered, I carry my possessions in
my own bosom. What I have inherited is the love of wisdom, justice,
and freedom. If I lose these I shall become as the least of your
slaves; now I give advice for nothing, but then I should sell it. The
gentlemen went away laughing and saying, Your humble servants, wise
Hellenia. But they missed their object, for the people took up this
name as a name of honour. When they saw that their shot had missed they
began to calumniate her, and to say that she had bewitched the people;
but our people and the good Krekalanders understood at once that it
was calumny. She was once asked, If you are not a witch, what is the
use of the eggs that you always carry with you? Min-erva answered,
These eggs are the symbols of Frya's counsels, in which our future
and that of the whole human race lies concealed. Time will hatch them,
and we must watch that no harm happens to them. The priests said, Well
answered; but what is the use of the dog on your right hand? Hellenia
replied, Does not the shepherd have a sheep-dog to keep his flock
together? What the dog is to the shepherd I am in Frya's service. I
must watch over Frya's flocks. We understand that very well, said the
priests; but tell us what means the owl that always sits upon your
head, is that light-shunning animal a sign of your clear vision? No,
answered Hellenia; he reminds me that there are people on earth who,
like him, have their homes in churches and holes, who go about in the
twilight, not, like him, to deliver us from mice and other plagues,
but to invent tricks to steal away the knowledge of other people, in
order to take advantage of them, to make slaves of them, and to suck
their blood like leeches. Another time they came with a whole troop
of people, when the plague was in the country, and said: We are all
making offerings to the gods that they may take away the plague. Will
you not help to turn away their anger, or have you yourself brought the
plague into the land with all your arts? No, said Min-erva; I know no
gods that do evil, therefore I cannot ask them to do better. I only
know one good spirit, that is Wr-alda's; and as he is good he never
does evil. Where, then, does evil come from? asked the priests. All
the evil comes from you, and from the stupidity of the people who let
themselves be deceived by you. If, then, your god is so exceedingly
good, why does he not turn away the bad? asked the priests. Hellenia
answered: Frya has placed us here, and the carrier, that is, Time,
must do the rest. For all calamities there is counsel and remedy to
be found, but Wr-alda wills that we should search it out ourselves,
in order that we may become strong and wise. If we will not do that,
he leaves us to our own devices, in order that we may experience the
results of wise or foolish conduct. Then a prince said, I should think
it best to submit. Very possibly, answered Hellenia; for then men
would be like sheep, and you and the priests would take care of them,
shearing them and leading them to the shambles. This is what our god
does not desire, he desires that we should help one another, but that
all should be free and wise. That is also our desire, and therefore our
people choose their princes, counts, councillors, chiefs, and masters
among the wisest of the good men, in order that every man shall do
his best to be wise and good. Thus doing, we learn ourselves and
teach the people that being wise and acting wisely can alone lead to
holiness. That seems very good judgment, said the priests; but if you
mean that the plague is caused by our stupidity, then Nyhellenia will
perhaps be so good as to bestow upon us a little of that new light of
which she is so proud. Yes, said Hellenia, but ravens and other birds
of prey feed only on dead carrion, whereas the plague feeds not only
on carrion but on bad laws and customs and wicked passions. If you
wish the plague to depart from you and not return, you must put away
your bad passions and become pure within and without. We admit that
the advice is good, said the priests, but how shall we induce all the
people under our rule to agree to it? Then Hellenia stood up and said:
The sparrows follow the sower, and the people their good princes,
therefore it becomes you to begin by rendering yourselves pure, so
that you may look within and without, and not be ashamed of your own
conduct. Now, instead of purifying the people, you have invented foul
festivals, in which they have so long revelled that they wallow like
swine in the mire to atone for your evil passions. The people began
to mock and to jeer, so that she did not dare to pursue the subject;
and one would have thought that they would have called all the people
together to drive us out of the land; but no, in place of abusing
her they went all about from the heathenish Krekaland to the Alps,
proclaiming that it had pleased the Almighty God to send his clever
daughter Min-erva, surnamed Nyhellenia, over the sea in a cloud to
give people good counsel, and that all who listened to her should
become rich and happy, and in the end governors of all the kingdoms
of the earth. They erected statues to her on all their altars,
they announced and sold to the simple people advice that she had
never given, and related miracles that she had never performed. They
cunningly made themselves masters of our laws and customs, and by
craft and subtlety were able to explain and spread them around. They
appointed priestesses under their own care, who were apparently
under the protection of Festa, our first Eeremoeder, to watch over
the holy lamp; but that lamp they lit themselves, and instead of
imbuing the priestesses with wisdom, and then sending them to watch
the sick and educate the young, they made them stupid and ignorant,
and never allowed them to come out. They were employed as advisers,
but the advice which seemed to come from them was but the repetition of
the behests of the priests. When Nyhellenia died, we wished to choose
another mother, and some of us wished to go to Texland to look for
her; but the priests, who were all-powerful among their own people,
would not permit it, and accused us before the people of being unholy.






FROM THE WRITINGS OF MINNO.


When I came away from Athenia with my followers, we arrived at
an island named by my crew Kreta, because of the cries that the
inhabitants raised on our arrival. When they really saw that we did
not come to make war, they were quiet, so that at last I was able to
buy a harbour in exchange for a boat and some iron implements, and a
piece of land. When we had been settled there a short time, and they
discovered that we had no slaves, they were very much astonished;
and when I explained to them that we had laws which made everybody
equal, they wished to have the same; but they had hardly established
them before the whole land was in confusion.

The priests and the princes declared that we had excited their
subjects to rebellion, and the people appealed to us for aid and
protection. When the princes saw that they were about to lose their
kingdom, they gave freedom to their people, and came to me to establish
a code of laws. The people, however, got no freedom, and the princes
remained masters, acting according to their own pleasure. When this
storm had passed, they began to sow divisions among us. They told my
people that I had invoked their assistance to make myself permanent
king. Once I found poison in my food. So when a ship from Flyland
sailed past, I quietly took my departure. Leaving alone, then, my own
adventures, I will conclude this history by saying that we must not
have anything to do with Finda's people, wherever it may be, because
they are full of false tricks, fully as much to be feared as their
sweet wine with deadly poison.


                       HERE ENDS MINNO'S WRITING.






THESE ARE THE THREE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THESE LAWS ARE FOUNDED.


1. Everybody knows that he requires the necessaries of life, and if
he cannot obtain them he does not know how to preserve his life.

2. All men have a natural desire to have children, and if it is not
satisfied they are not aware what evil may spring from it.

3. Every man knows that he wishes to live free and undisturbed,
and that others wish the same thing.

To secure this, these laws and regulations are made.

The people of Finda have also their rules and regulations, but these
are not made according to what is just--only for the advantage of
priests and princes--therefore their states are full of disputes
and murder.

1. If any man falls into a state of destitution, his case must be
brought before the count by the maidens, because a high-minded Frisian
cannot bear to do that himself.

2. If any man becomes poor because he will not work, he must be sent
out of the country, because the cowardly and lazy are troublesome
and ill-disposed, therefore they ought to be got rid of.

3. Every young man ought to seek a bride and to be married at
five-and-twenty.

4. If a young man is not married at five-and-twenty, he must be
driven from his home, and the younger men must avoid him. If then
he will not marry, he must be declared dead, and leave the country,
so that he may not give offence.

5. If a man is impotent, he must openly declare that no one has
anything to fear from him, then he may come or go where he likes.

6. If after that he commits any act of incontinence, then he must
flee away; if he does not, he may be given over to the vengeance of
those whom he has offended, and no one may aid him.

7. Any one who commits a theft shall restore it threefold. For a
second offence he shall be sent to the tin mines. The person robbed
may forgive him if he pleases, but for a third offence no one shall
protect him.






THESE RULES ARE MADE FOR ANGRY PEOPLE.


1. If a man in a passion or out of ill will breaks another's limb
or puts out an eye or a tooth, he must pay whatever the injured
man demands. If he cannot pay, he must suffer the same injury as
he has done to the other. If he refuses this, he must appeal to the
Burgtmaagd in order to be sent to work in the iron or tin mines until
he has expiated his crime under the general law.

2. If a man is so wicked as to kill a Frisian, he must forfeit his
own life; but if the Burgtmaagd can send him to the tin mines for
his life before he is taken, she may do so.

3. If the prisoner can prove by proper witnesses that the death was
accidental, he may go free; but if it happens a second time, he must go
to the tin mines, in order to avoid any unseemly hatred or vengeance.






THESE ARE THE RULES CONCERNING BASTARDS.


1. If any man sets fire to another's house, he is no Frisian, he is
a bastard. If he is caught in the act, he must be thrown into the
fire; and wherever he may flee, he shall never be secure from the
avenging justice.

2. No true Frisian shall speak ill of the faults of his neighbours. If
any man injures himself, but does no harm to others, he must be his
own judge; but if he becomes so bad that he is dangerous to others,
they must bring it before the count. But if instead of going to the
count a man accuses another behind his back, he must be put on the
pillory in the market-place, and then sent out of the country, but
not to the tin mines, because even there a backbiter is to be feared.

3. If any man should prove a traitor and show to our enemies the paths
leading to our places of refuge, or creep into them by night, he must
be the offspring of Finda; he must be burnt. The sailors must take his
mother and all his relations to a desolate island, and there scatter
his ashes, in order that no poisonous herbs may spring from them. The
maidens must curse his name in all the states, in order that no child
may be called by his name, and that his ancestors may repudiate him.

War had come to an end, but famine came in its place. There were
three men who each stole a sack of corn from different owners, but
they were all caught. The first owner brought his thief to the judge,
and the maidens said everywhere that he had done right. The second
owner took the corn away from his thief and let him go in peace. The
maidens said he has done well. The third owner went to the thief's
house, and when he saw what misery was there, he went and brought a
waggon-load of necessaries to relieve their distress. Frya's maidens
came around him and wrote his deed in the eternal book, and wiped
out all his sins. This was reported to the Eeremoeder, and she had
it made known over the whole country.






WHAT IS WRITTEN HEREUNDER IS INSCRIBED ON THE WALLS OF WARABURGT.

(See Plate I.)


What appears at the top is the signs of the Juul--that is, the first
symbol of Wr-alda, also of the origin or beginning from which Time
is derived; this is the Kroder, which must always go round with the
Juul. According to this model Frya formed the set hand which she
used to write her Tex. When Fasta was Eeremoeder she made a running
hand out of it. The Witkoning--that is, the Sea-King Godfried the
Old--made separate numbers for the set hand and for the runic hand. It
is therefore not too much that we celebrate it once a year. We may be
eternally thankful to Wr-alda that he allowed his spirit to exercise
such an influence over our forefathers.

In her time Finda also invented a mode of writing, but that was so
high-flown and full of flourishes that her descendants have soon lost
the meaning of it.

Afterwards they learned our writing--that is, the Finns, the Thyriers,
and the Krekalanders--but they did not know that it was taken
from the Juul, and most therefore always be written round like the
sun. Furthermore, they wished that their writing should be illegible
by other people, because they always had matters to conceal. In
doing this they acted very unwisely, because their children could
only with great difficulty read the writings of their predecessors,
whereas our most ancient writings are as easy to read as those that
were written yesterday.

Here is a specimen of the set hand and of the running hand, as well
as of the figures, in both.

(See Plate II.)






THIS STANDS INSCRIBED UPON ALL CITADELS.


Before the bad time came our country was the most beautiful in the
world. The sun rose higher, and there was seldom frost. The trees and
shrubs produced various fruits, which are now lost. In the fields we
had not only barley, oats, and rye, but wheat which shone like gold,
and which could be baked in the sun's rays. The years were not counted,
for one was as happy as another.

On one side we were bounded by Wr-alda's Sea, on which no one but us
might or could sail; on the other side we were hedged in by the broad
Twiskland (Tusschenland, Duitschland), through which the Finda people
dared not come on account of the thick forests and the wild beasts.

Eastward our boundary went to the extremity of the East Sea, and
westward to the Mediterranean Sea; so that besides the small rivers
we had twelve large rivers given us by Wr-alda to keep our land moist,
and to show our seafaring men the way to his sea.

The banks of these rivers were at one time entirely inhabited
by our people, as well as the banks of the Rhine from one end
to the other. Opposite Denmark and Jutland we had colonies and a
Burgtmaagd. Thence we obtained copper and iron, as well as tar and
pitch, and some other necessaries. Opposite to us we had Britain,
formerly Westland, with her tin mines.

Britain was the land of the exiles, who with the help of their
Burgtmaagd had gone away to save their lives; but in order that they
might not come back they were tattooed with a B on the forehead, the
banished with a red dye, the other criminals with blue. Moreover, our
sailors and merchants had many factories among the distant Krekalanders
and in Lydia. In Lydia (Lybia) the people are black. As our country
was so great and extensive, we had many different names. Those who
were settled to the east of Denmark were called Jutten, because often
they did nothing else than look for amber (jutten) on the shore. Those
who lived in the islands were called Letten, because they lived an
isolated life. All those who lived between Denmark and the Sandval,
now the Scheldt, were called Stuurlieden (pilots), Zeekampers (naval
men), and Angelaren (fishermen). The Angelaren were men who fished in
the sea, and were so named because they used lines and hooks instead of
nets. From there to the nearest part of Krekaland the inhabitants were
called Kadhemers, because they never went to sea but remained ashore.

Those who were settled in the higher marches bounded by Twisklanden
(Germany) were called Saxmannen, because they were always armed
against the wild beasts and the savage Britons. Besides these we had
the names Landzaten (natives of the land), Marzaten (natives of the
fens), and Woud or Hout zaten (natives of the woods).






HOW THE BAD TIME CAME.


During the whole summer the sun had been hid behind the clouds,
as if unwilling to look upon the earth. There was perpetual calm,
and the damp mist hung like a wet sail over the houses and the
marshes. The air was heavy and oppressive, and in men's hearts was
neither joy nor cheerfulness. In the midst of this stillness the
earth began to tremble as if she was dying. The mountains opened to
vomit forth fire and flames. Some sank into the bosom of the earth,
and in other places mountains rose out of the plain. Aldland, called
by the seafaring people, Atland, disappeared, and the wild waves
rose so high over hill and dale that everything was buried in the
sea. Many people were swallowed up by the earth, and others who had
escaped the fire perished in the water.

It was not only in Finda's land that the earth vomited fire, but also
in Twiskland (Germany). Whole forests were burned one after the other,
and when the wind blew from that quarter our land was covered with
ashes. Rivers changed their course, and at their mouths new islands
were formed of sand and drift.

During three years this continued, but at length it ceased, and
forests became visible. Many countries were submerged, and in other
places land rose above the sea, and the wood was destroyed through
the half of Twiskland (Germany). Troops of Finda's people came and
settled in the empty places. Our dispersed people were exterminated
or made slaves. Then watchfulness was doubly impressed upon us,
and time taught us that union is force.






THIS IS INSCRIBED ON THE WARABURGT BY THE ALDEGAMUDE.


The Waraburgt is not a maiden's city, but the place where all the
foreign articles brought by sailors were stored. It lies three hours
south from Medeasblik.



THUS IS THE PREFACE.

Hills, bow your heads; weep, ye streams and clouds. Yes. Schoonland
(Scandinavia) blushes, an enslaved people tramples on your garment,
O Frya.



THIS IS THE HISTORY.

One hundred and one years after the submersion of Aldland a people
came out of the East. That people was driven by another. Behind us,
in Twiskland (Germany), they fell into disputes, divided into two
parties, and each went its own way. Of the one no account has come to
us, but the other came in the back of our Schoonland, which was thinly
inhabited, particularly the upper part. Therefore they were able to
take possession of it without contest, and as they did no other harm,
we would not make war about it. Now that we have learned to know them,
we will describe their customs, and after that how matters went between
us. They were not wild people, like most of Finda's race; but, like the
Egyptians, they have priests and also statues in their churches. The
priests are the only rulers; they call themselves Magyars, and their
headman Magy. He is high priest and king in one. The rest of the people
are of no account, and in subjection to them. This people have not even
a name; but we call them Finns, because although all the festivals are
melancholy and bloody, they are so formal that we are inferior to them
in that respect. But still they are not to be envied, because they are
slaves to their priests, and still more to their creeds. They believe
that evil spirits abound everywhere, and enter into men and beasts,
but of Wr-alda's spirit they know nothing. They have weapons of stone,
the Magyars of copper. The Magyars affirm that they can exorcise
and recall the evil spirits, and this frightens the people, so that
you never see a cheerful face. When they were well established, the
Magyars sought our friendship, they praised our language and customs,
our cattle and iron weapons, which they would willingly have exchanged
for their gold and silver ornaments, and they always kept their people
within their own boundaries, and that outwitted our watchfulness.

Eighty years afterwards, just at the time of the Juulfeest, they
overran our country like a snowstorm driven by the wind. All who
could not flee away were killed. Frya was appealed to, but the
Schoonlanders (Scandinavians) had neglected her advice. Then all
the forces were assembled, and three hours from Godasburgt they
were withstood, but war continued. Kat or Katerine was the name of
the priestess who was Burgtmaagd of Godasburgt. Kat was proud and
haughty, and would neither seek counsel nor aid from the mother;
but when the Burgtheeren (citizens) knew this, they themselves
sent messengers to Texland to the Eeremoeder. Minna--this was the
name of the mother--summoned all the sailors and the young men from
Oostflyland and Denmark. From this expedition the history of Wodin
sprang, which is inscribed on the citadels, and is here copied. At
Aldergamude there lived an old sea-king whose name was Sterik, and
whose deeds were famous. This old fellow had three nephews. Wodin,
the eldest, lived at Lumkamakia, near the Eemude, in Oostflyland,
with his parents. He had once commanded troops. Teunis and Inka were
naval warriors, and were just then staying with their father at
Aldergamude. When the young warriors had assembled together, they
chose Wodin to be their leader or king, and the naval force chose
Teunis for their sea-king and Inka for their admiral. The navy then
sailed to Denmark, where they took on board Wodin and his valiant host.

The wind was fair, so they arrived immediately in Schoonland. When the
northern brothers met together, Wodin divided his powerful army into
three bodies. Frya was their war-cry, and they drove back the Finns
and Magyars like children. When the Magy heard how his forces had
been utterly defeated, he sent messengers with truncheon and crown,
who said to Wodin: O almighty king, we are guilty, but all that we
have done was done from necessity. You think that we attacked your
brothers out of ill will, but we were driven out by our enemies, who
are still at our heels. We have often asked your Burgtmaagd for help,
but she took no notice of us. The Magy says that if we kill half our
numbers in fighting with each other, then the wild shepherds will come
and kill all the rest. The Magy possesses great riches, but he has
seen that Frya is much more powerful than all our spirits together. He
will lay down his head in her lap. You are the most warlike king on
the earth, and your people are of iron. Become our king, and we will
all be your slaves. What glory it would be for you if you could drive
back the savages! Our trumpets would resound with your praises, and
the fame of your deeds would precede you everywhere. Wodin was strong,
fierce, and warlike, but he was not clear-sighted, therefore he was
taken in their toils, and crowned by the Magy.

Very many of the sailors and soldiers to whom this proceeding was
displeasing went away secretly, taking Kat with them. But Kat, who did
not wish to appear before either the mother or the general assembly,
jumped overboard. Then a storm arose and drove the ships upon the
banks of Denmark, with the total destruction of their crews. This
strait was afterwards called the Kattegat. When Wodin was crowned,
he attacked the savages, who were all horsemen, and fell upon Wodin's
troops like a hailstorm; but like a whirl-wind they were turned back,
and did not dare to appear again. When Wodin returned, Magy gave him
his daughter to wife. Whereupon he was incensed with herbs; but they
were magic herbs, and by degrees he became so audacious that he dared
to disavow and ridicule the spirits of Frya and Wr-alda, while he
bent his free head before the false and deceitful images. His reign
lasted seven years, and then he disappeared. The Magy said that he
was taken up by their gods and still reigned over us, but our people
laughed at what they said. When Wodin had disappeared some time,
disputes arose. We wished to choose another king, but the Magy would
not permit it. He asserted that it was his right given him by his
idols. But besides this dispute there was one between the Magyars and
Finns, who would honour neither Frya nor Wodin; but the Magy did just
as he pleased, because his daughter had a son by Wodin, and he would
have it that this son was of high descent. While all were disputing and
quarrelling, he crowned the boy as king, and set up himself as guardian
and counsellor. Those who cared more for themselves than for justice
let him work his own way, but the good men took their departure. Many
Magyars fled back with their troops, and the sea-people took ship,
accompanied by a body of stalwart Finns as rowers.

Next comes upon the stage the history of Neef Teunis and Neef Inka.






ALL THIS IS INSCRIBED NOT ONLY ON THE WARABURGT, BUT ALSO ON THE
BURGT STAVIA, WHICH LIES BEHIND THE PORT OF STAVRE.


When Teunis wished to return home, he went first towards Denmark;
but he might not land there, for so the mother had ordered, nor
was he to land at Flyland nor anywhere about there. In this way he
would have lost all his people by want and hardship, so he landed
at night to steal and sailed on by day. Thus coasting along, he at
length arrived at the colony of Kadik (Cadiz), so called because it
was built with a stone quay. Here they bought all kinds of stores,
but Tuntia the Burgtmaagd would not allow them to settle there. When
they were ready they began to disagree. Teunis wished to sail through
the straits to the Mediterranean Sea, and enter the service of the
rich Egyptian king, as he had done before, but Inka said he had had
enough of all those Finda's people. Inka thought that perchance some
high-lying part of Atland might remain as an island, where he and
his people might live in peace. As the two cousins could not agree,
Teunis planted a red flag on the shore, and Inka a blue flag. Every
man could choose which he pleased, and to their astonishment the
greater part of the Finns and Magyars followed Inka, who had objected
to serve the kings of Finda's people. When they had counted the people
and divided the ships accordingly, the fleet separated. We shall hear
of Teunis afterwards, but nothing more of Inka.

Neef Teunis coasted through the straits to the Mediterranean
Sea. When Atland was submerged there was much suffering also on
the shores of the Mediterranean, on which account many of Finda's
people, Krekalanders, and people from Lyda's land, came to us. On
the other hand, many of our people went to Lyda's land. The result
of all this was that the Krekalanders far and wide were lost to the
superintendence of the mother. Teunis had reckoned on this, and had
therefore wished to find there a good haven from which he might go
and serve under the rich princes; but as his fleet and his people had
such a shattered appearance, the inhabitants on the coasts thought
that they were pirates, and drove them away. At last they arrived
at the Phoenician coast, one hundred and ninety-three years after
Atland was submerged. Near the coast they found an island with two
deep bays, so that there appeared to be three islands. In the middle
one they established themselves, and afterwards built a city wall
round the place. Then they wanted to give it a name, but disagreed
about it. Some wanted to call it Fryasburgt, others Neeftunia; but
the Magyars and Finns begged that it might be called Thyrhisburgt.

Thyr was the name of one of their idols, and it was upon his feast-day
that they had landed there; and in return they offered to recognise
Teunis as their perpetual king. Teunis let himself be persuaded, and
the others would not make any quarrel about it. When they were well
established, they sent some old seamen and Magyars on an expedition as
far as the town of Sidon; but at first the inhabitants of the coast
would have nothing to do with them, saying, You are only foreign
adventurers whom we do not respect. But when we sold them some of
our iron weapons, everything went well. They also wished to buy our
amber, and their inquiries about it were incessant. But Teunis, who was
far-seeing, pretended that he had no more iron weapons or amber. Then
merchants came and begged him to let them have twenty vessels, which
they would freight with the finest goods, and they would provide as
many people to row as he would require. Twelve ships were then laden
with wine, honey, tanned leather, and saddles and bridles mounted in
gold, such as had never been seen before.

Teunis sailed to the Flymeer with all this treasure, which so
enchanted the Grevetman of Westflyland that he induced Teunis to
build a warehouse at the mouth of the Flymeer. Afterwards this place
was called Almanaland, and the market where they traded at Wyringen
was called Toelaatmarkt. The mother advised that they should sell
everything except iron weapons, but no attention was paid to what she
said. As the Thyriers had thus free play, they came from far and near
to take away our goods, to the loss of our seafaring people. Therefore
it was resolved in a general assembly to allow only seven Thyrian
ships and no more in a year.






WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS WAS.


In the northernmost part of the Mediterranean there lies an island
close to the coast. They now came and asked to buy that, on which a
general council was held.

The mother's advice was asked, and she wished to see them at
some distance, so she saw no harm in it; but as we afterwards
saw what a mistake we had made, we called the island Missellia
(Marseilles). Hereafter will be seen what reason we had. The Golen,
as the missionary priests of Sidon were called, had observed that
the land there was thinly peopled, and was far from the mother. In
order to make a favourable impression, they had themselves called
in our language followers of the truth; but they had better have
been called abstainers from the truth, or, in short, "Triuwenden,"
as our seafaring people afterwards called them. When they were well
established, their merchants exchanged their beautiful copper weapons
and all sorts of jewels for our iron weapons and hides of wild beasts,
which were abundant in our southern countries; but the Golen celebrated
all sorts of vile and monstrous festivals, which the inhabitants
of the coast promoted with their wanton women and sweet poisonous
wine. If any of our people had so conducted himself that his life was
in danger, the Golen afforded him a refuge, and sent him to Phonisia,
that is, Palmland. When he was settled there, they made him write to
his family, friends, and connections that the country was so good and
the people so happy that no one could form any idea of it. In Britain
there were plenty of men, but few women. When the Golen knew this,
they carried off girls everywhere and gave them to the Britons for
nothing. So all these girls served their purpose to steal children
from Wr-alda in order to give them to false gods.






NOW WE WILL WRITE ABOUT THE WAR BETWEEN THE BURGTMAAGDEN KALTA AND
MIN-ERVA,

And how we thereby lost all our southern lands and Britain to the
Golen.


Near the southern mouth of the Rhine and the Scheldt there are seven
islands, named after Frya's seven virgins of the week. In the middle
of one island is the city of Walhallagara (Middelburg), and on the
walls of this city the following history is inscribed. Above it are
the words "Read, learn, and watch."

Five hundred and sixty-three years after the submersion of Atland--that
is, 1600 years before Christ--a wise town priestess presided here,
whose name was Min-erva--called by the sailors Nyhellenia. This name
was well chosen, for her counsels were new and clear above all others.

On the other side of the Scheldt, at Flyburgt, Sijrhed presided. This
maiden was full of tricks. Her face was beautiful, and her tongue
was nimble; but the advice that she gave was always conveyed in
mysterious terms. Therefore the mariners called her Kalta, and the
landsmen thought it was a title. In the last will of the dead mother,
Rosamond was named first, Min-erva second, and Sijrhed third in
succession. Min-erva did not mind that, but Sijrhed was very much
offended. Like a foreign princess, she wished to be honoured, feared,
and worshipped; but Min-erva only desired to be loved. At last all
the sailors, even from Denmark and Flymeer, did homage to her. This
hurt Sijrhed, because she wanted to excel Min-erva. In order to
give an impression of her great watchfulness, she had a cock put
on her banner. So then Min-erva went and put a sheep-dog and an owl
on her banner. The dog, she said, guards his master and his flock,
and the owl watches that the mice shall not devastate the fields;
but the cock in his lewdness and his pride is only fit to murder his
nearest relations. When Kalta found that her scheme had failed she
was still more vexed, so she secretly sent for the Magyars to teach
her conjuring. When she had had enough of this she threw herself into
the hands of the Gauls; but all her malpractices did not improve her
position. When she saw that the sailors kept more and more aloof from
her, she tried to win them back by fear. At the full moon, when the
sea was stormy, she ran over the wild waves, calling to the sailors
that they would all be lost if they did not worship her. Then she
blinded their eyes, so that they mistook land for water and water for
land, and in this way many a good ship was totally lost. At the first
war-feast, when all her countrymen were armed, she brought casks of
beer, which she had drugged. When they were all drunk she mounted her
war-horse, leaning her head upon her spear. Sunrise could not be more
beautiful. When she saw that the eyes of all were fixed upon her,
she opened her lips and said:--

Sons and daughters of Frya, you know that in these last times we have
suffered much loss and misery because the sailors no longer come to
buy our paper, but you do not know what the reason of it is. I have
long kept silence about it, but can do so no longer. Listen, then,
my friends, that you may know on which side to show your teeth. On
the other side of the Scheldt, where from time to time there come
ships from all parts, they make now paper from pumpkin leaves, by
which they save flax and outdo us. Now, as the making of paper was
always our principal industry, the mother willed that people should
learn it from us; but Min-erva has bewitched all the people--yes,
bewitched, my friends--as well as all our cattle that died lately. I
must come out with it. If I were not Burgtmaagd, I should know what
to do. I should burn the witch in her nest.

As soon as she had uttered these words she sped away to her citadel;
but the drunken people were so excited that they did not stop to weigh
what they had heard. In mad haste they hurried over the Sandfal,
and as night came on they burst into the citadel. However, Kalta
again missed her aim; for Min-erva, her maidens, and her lamp were
all saved by the alertness of the seamen.






WE NOW COME TO THE HISTORY OF JON.


Jon, Jon, Jhon, Jan, are all the same name, though the pronunciation
varies, as the seamen like to shorten everything to be able to make
it easier to call. Jon--that is, "Given"--was a sea-king, born at
Alberga, who sailed from the Flymeer with a fleet of 127 ships fitted
out for a long voyage, and laden with amber, tin, copper, cloth, linen,
felt, otter-skins, beaver and rabbit skins. He would also have taken
paper from here, but when he saw how Kalta had destroyed the citadel
he became so angry that he went off with all his people to Flyburgt,
and out of revenge set fire to it. His admiral and some of his people
saved the lamp and the maidens, but they could not catch Sijrhed
(or Kalta). She climbed up on the furthest battlement, and they
thought she must be killed in the flames; but what happened? While
all her people stood transfixed with horror, she appeared upon her
steed more beautiful than ever, calling to them, "To Kalta!" Then the
other Schelda people poured out towards her. When the seamen saw that,
they shouted, "We are for Min-erva!" from which arose a war in which
thousands were killed.

At this time Rosamond the mother, who had done all in her power by
gentle means to preserve peace, when she saw how bad it was, made
short work of it. Immediately she sent messengers throughout all
the districts to call a general levy, which brought together all
the defenders of the country. The landsmen who were fighting were
all caught, but Jon with his seamen took refuge on board his fleet,
taking with him the two lamps, as well as Min-erva and the maidens
of both the citadels. Helprik, the chief, summoned him to appear;
but while all the soldiers were on the other side of the Scheldt,
Jon sailed back to the Flymeer, and then straight to our islands. His
fighting men and many of our people took women and children on board,
and when Jon saw that he and his people would be punished for their
misdeeds, he secretly took his departure. He did well, for all our
islanders, and the other Scheldt people who had been fighting were
transported to Britain. This step was a mistake, for now came the
beginning of the end. Kalta, who, people said, could go as easily on
the water as on the land, went to the mainland and on to Missellia
(Marseilles). Then came the Gauls out of the Mediterranean Sea with
their ships to Cadiz, and along all our coasts, and fell upon Britain;
but they could not make any good footing there, because the government
was powerful and the exiles were still Frisians. But now came Kalta and
said: You were born free, and for small offences have been sent away,
not for your own improvement, but to get tin by your labour. If you
wish to be free again, and take my advice, and live under my care,
come away. I will provide you with arms, and will watch over you. The
news flew through the land like lightning, and before the carrier's
wheel had made one revolution she was mistress of all the Thyriers
in all our southern states as far as the Seine. She built herself a
citadel on the high land to the north, and called it Kaltasburgh. It
still exists under the name of Kerenak. From this castle she ruled
as a true mother, against their will, not for her followers, but over
them, who were thenceforth called Kelts. The Gauls gradually obtained
dominion over the whole of Britain, partly because they no longer
had any citadel; secondly, because they had there no Burgtmaagden;
and thirdly, because they had no real lamps. From all these causes
the people could not learn anything. They were stupid and foolish,
and having allowed the Gauls to rob them of their arms, they were
led about like a bull with a ring in his nose.






NOW WE SHALL WRITE HOW IT FARED WITH JON.

IT IS INSCRIBED AT TEXLAND.


Ten years after Jon went away, there arrived three ships in the
Flymeer; the people cried Huzza! (What a blessing!) and from their
accounts the mother had this written.

When Jon reached the Mediterranean Sea, the reports of the Gauls had
preceded him, so that on the nearest Italian coast he was nowhere
safe. Therefore he went with his fleet straight over to Lybia. There
the black men wanted to catch them and eat them. At last they came
to Tyre, but Min-erva said, Keep clear, for here the air has been
long poisoned by the priests. The king was a descendant of Teunis,
as we were afterwards informed; but as the priests wished to have a
king, who, according to their ideas, was of long descent, they deified
Teunis, to the vexation of his followers. After they had passed Tyre,
the Tyrians seized one of the rearmost ships, and as the ship was
too far behind us, we could not take it back again; but Jon swore to
be revenged for it. When night came, Jon bent his course towards the
distant Krekalanden. At last they arrived at a country that looked
very barren, but they found a harbour there. Here, said Min-erva,
we need not perhaps have any fear of princes or priests, as they
always look out for rich fat lands. When they entered the harbour,
there was not room for all the ships, and yet most of the people were
too cowardly to go any further. Then Jon, who wished to get away, went
with his spear and banner, calling to the young people, to know who
would volunteer to share his adventures. Min-erva did the same thing,
but she wished to remain there. The greater part stopped with Min-erva,
but the young sailors went with Jon. Jon took the lamp of Kalta and
her maidens with him. Min-erva retained her lamp and her own maidens.

Between the near and the distant coasts of Italy Jon found some
islands, which he thought desirable. Upon the largest he built a city
in the wood between the mountains. From the smaller islands he made
expeditions for vengeance on the Tyrians, and plundered their ships
and their lands. Therefore these islands were called Insulae Piratarum,
as well as Johannis Insulae.

When Min-erva had examined the country which is called by the
inhabitants Attica, she saw that the people were all goatherds,
and that they lived on meat, wild roots, herbs, and honey. They were
clothed in skins, and had their dwellings on the slopes (hellinga)
of the hills, wherefore they were called Hellingers. At first they
ran away, but when they found that we did not attack them, they came
back and showed great friendship. Min-erva asked if we might settle
there peaceably. This was agreed to on the condition that we should
help them to fight against their neighbours, who came continually to
carry away their children and to rob their dwellings. Then we built
a citadel at an hour's distance from the harbour. By the advice of
Min-erva it was called Athens, because, she said, those who come
after us ought to know that we are not here by cunning or violence,
but were received as friends (atha). While we were building the citadel
the principal personages came to see us, and when they saw that we had
no slaves it did not please them, and they gave her to understand it,
as they thought that she was a princess. But Min-erva said, How did
you get your slaves? They answered, We bought some and took others
in war. Min-erva replied, If nobody would buy slaves they would not
steal your children, and you would have no wars about it. If you wish
to remain our allies, you will free your slaves. The chiefs did not
like this, and wanted to drive us away; but the most enlightened of
the people came and helped us to build our citadel, which was built
of stone.

This is the history of Jon and of Min-erva.

When they had finished their story they asked respectfully for iron
weapons; for, said they, our foes are powerful, but if we have good
arms we can withstand them. When this had been agreed to, the people
asked if Frya's customs would flourish in Athens and in other parts
of Greece (Krekalanden). The mother answered, If the distant Greeks
belong to the direct descent of Frya, then they will flourish; but if
they do not descend from Frya, then there will be a long contention
about it, because the carrier must make five thousand revolutions of
his Juul before Finda's people will be ripe for liberty.






THIS IS ABOUT THE GEERTMEN.

When Hellenia or Min-erva died, the priests pretended to be with us,
and in order to make it appear so, they deified Hellenia. They refused
to have any other mother chosen, saying that they feared there was
no one among her maidens whom they could trust as they had trusted
Min-erva, surnamed Nyhellenia.

But we would not recognise Min-erva as a goddess, because she herself
had told us that no one could be perfectly good except the spirit of
Wr-alda. Therefore we chose Geert Pyre's daughter for our mother. When
the priests saw that they could not fry their herrings on our fire
(have everything their own way), they left Athens, and said that we
refused to acknowledge Min-erva as a goddess out of envy, because she
had shown so much affection to the natives. Thereupon they gave the
people statues of her, declaring that they might ask of them whatever
they liked, as long as they were obedient to her. By these kinds
of tales the stupid people were estranged from us, and at last they
attacked us; but as we had built our stone city wall with two horns
down to the sea, they could not get at us. Then, lo and behold! an
Egyptian high priest, bright of eye, clear of brain, and enlightened
of mind, whose name was Cecrops, came to give them advice.

When he saw that with his people he could not storm our wall, he sent
messengers to Tyre. Thereupon there arrived three hundred ships full
of wild mountain soldiers, which sailed unexpectedly into our haven
while we were defending the walls. When they had taken our harbour,
the wild soldiers wanted to plunder the village and our ships--one
had already ravished a girl--but Cecrops would not permit it; and
the Tyrian sailors, who still had Frisian blood in their veins, said,
If you do that we will burn our ships, and you shall never see your
mountains again. Cecrops, who had no inclination towards murder
or devastation, sent messengers to Geert, requiring her to give
up the citadel, offering her free exit with all her live and dead
property, and her followers the same. The wisest of the citizens,
seeing that they could not hold the citadel, advised Geert to accept
at once, before Cecrops became furious and changed his mind. Three
months afterwards Geert departed with the best of Frya's sons, and
seven times twelve ships. Soon after they had left the harbour they
fell in with at least thirty ships coming from Tyre with women and
children. They were on their way to Athens, but when they heard how
things stood there they went with Geert. The sea-king of the Tyrians
brought them altogether through the strait which at that time ran
into the Red Sea (now re-established as the Suez Canal). At last
they landed at the Punjab, called in our language the Five Rivers,
because five rivers flow together to the sea. Here they settled, and
called it Geertmania. The King of Tyre afterwards, seeing that all
his best sailors were gone, sent all his ships with his wild soldiers
to catch them, dead or alive. When they arrived at the strait, both
the sea and the earth trembled. The land was upheaved so that all the
water ran out of the strait, and the muddy shores were raised up like
a rampart. This happened on account of the virtues of the Geertmen,
as every one can plainly understand.






IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND AND FIVE AFTER ATLAND WAS SUBMERGED, THIS
WAS INSCRIBED ON THE EASTERN WALL OF FRYASBURGT.


After twelve years had elapsed without our seeing any Italians in
Almanland, there came three ships, finer than any that we possessed
or had ever seen.

On the largest of them was a king of the Jonischen Islands whose name
was Ulysses, the fame of whose wisdom was great. To him a priestess
had prophesied that he should become the king of all Italy provided he
could obtain a lamp that had been lighted at the lamp in Texland. For
this purpose he had brought great treasures with him, above all,
jewels for women more beautiful than had ever been seen before. They
were from Troy, a town that the Greeks had taken. All these treasures
he offered to the mother, but the mother would have nothing to do with
them. At last, when he found that there was nothing to be got from
her, he went to Walhallagara (Walcheren). There there was established
a Burgtmaagd whose name was Kaat, but who was commonly called Kalip,
because her lower lip stuck out like a mast-head. Here he tarried for
years, to the scandal of all that knew it. According to the report
of the maidens, he obtained a lamp from her; but it did him no good,
because when he got to sea his ship was lost, and he was taken up
naked and destitute by another ship. There was left behind by this
king a writer of pure Frya's blood, born in the new harbour of Athens,
who wrote for us what follows about Athens, from which may be seen
how truly the mother Hel-licht spoke when she said that the customs
of Frya could never take firm hold in Athens.

From the other Greeks you will have heard a great deal of bad about
Cecrops, because he was not in good repute; but I dare affirm that he
was an enlightened man; very renowned both among the inhabitants and
among us, for he was against oppression, unlike the other priests,
and was virtuous, and knew how to value the wisdom of distant
nations. Knowing that, he permitted us to live according to our own
Asegaboek. There was a story current that he was favourable to us
because he was the son of a Frisian girl and an Egyptian priest: the
reason of this was that he had blue eyes, and that many of our girls
had been stolen and sold to Egypt, but he never confirmed this. However
it may have been, certain it is that he showed us more friendship than
all the other priests together. When he died, his successors soon began
to tear up our charters, and gradually to enact so many unsuitable
statutes that at long last nothing remained of liberty but the shadow
and the name. Besides, they would not allow the laws to be written,
so that the knowledge of them was hidden from us. Formerly all the
cases in Athens were pleaded in our language, but afterwards in both
languages, and at last in the native language only. At first the men of
Athens only married women of our own race, but the young men as they
grew up with the girls of the country took them to wife. The bastard
children of this connection were the handsomest and cleverest in the
world; but they were likewise the wickedest, wavering between the two
parties, paying no regard to laws or customs except where they suited
their own interests. As long as a ray of Frya's spirit existed, all
the building materials were for common use, and no one might build a
house larger or better than his neighbours; but when some degenerate
townspeople got rich by sea-voyages and by the silver that their slaves
got in the silver countries, they went to live out on the hills or
in the valleys. There, behind high enclosures of trees or walls,
they built palaces with costly furniture, and in order to remain
in good odour with the nasty priests, they placed there likenesses
of false gods and unchaste statues. Sometimes the dirty priests and
princes wished for the boys rather than the girls, and often led them
astray from the paths of virtue by rich presents or by force. Because
riches were more valued by this lost and degenerate race than virtue
or honour, one sometimes saw boys dressed in splendid flowing robes,
to the disgrace of their parents and maidens, and to the shame of
their own sex. If our simple parents came to a general assembly at
Athens and made complaints, a cry was raised, Hear, hear! there is
a sea-monster going to speak. Such is Athens become, like a morass
in a tropical country full of leeches, toads, and poisonous snakes,
in which no man of decent habits can set his foot.






THIS IS INSCRIBED IN ALL OUR CITADELS.


How our Denmark was lost to us 1602 years after the submersion of
Atland. Through the mad wantonness of Wodin, Magy had become master
of the east part of Scandinavia. They dare not come over the hills
and over the sea. The mother would not prevent it. She said, I see
no danger in their weapons, but much in taking the Scandinavians
back again, because they are so degenerate and spoilt. The general
assembly were of the same opinion. Therefore it was left to him. A
good hundred years ago Denmark began to trade; they gave their iron
weapons in exchange for gold ornaments, as well as for copper and
iron-ore. The mother sent messengers to advise them to have nothing
to do with this trade. There was danger to their morals in it, and if
they lost their morals they would soon lose their liberty. But the
Denmarkers paid no attention to her. They did not believe that they
could lose their morals, therefore they would not listen to her. At
last they were at a loss themselves for weapons and necessaries, and
this difficulty was their punishment. Their bodies were brilliantly
adorned, but their cupboards and their sheds were empty. Just one
hundred years after the first ship with provisions sailed from
the coast, poverty and want made their appearance, hunger spread
her wings all over the country, dissension marched proudly about
the streets and into the houses, charity found no place, and unity
departed. The child asked its mother for food; she had no food to
give, only jewels. The women applied to their husbands, the husbands
appealed to the counts; the counts had nothing to give, or if they had,
they hid it away. Now the jewels must be sold, but while the sailors
were away for that purpose, the frost came and laid a plank upon the
sea and the strait (the Sound). When the frost had made the bridge,
vigilance ceased in the land, and treachery took its place. Instead
of watching on the shores, they put their horses in their sledges
and drove off to Scandinavia. Then the Scandinavians, who hungered
after the land of their forefathers, came to Denmark. One bright
night they all came. Now, they said, we have a right to the land of
our fathers; and while they were fighting about it, the Finns came to
the defenceless villages and ran away with the children. As they had
no good weapons, they lost the battle, and with it their freedom,
and Magy became master. All this was the consequence of their not
reading Frya's Tex, and neglecting her counsels. There are some who
think that they were betrayed by the counts, and that the maidens
had long suspected it; but if any one attempted to speak about it,
his mouth was shut by golden chains.

We can express no opinion about it, we can only say to you, Do not
trust too much to the wisdom of your princes or of your maidens;
but if you wish to keep things straight, everybody must watch over
his own passions, as well as the general welfare.

Two years afterwards Magy himself came with a fleet of light boats
to steal the lamp from the mother of Texland. This wicked deed he
accomplished one stormy winter night, while the wind roared and the
hail rattled against the windows. The watchman on the tower hearing
the noise, lighted his torch. As soon as the light from the tower fell
upon the bastion, he saw that already armed men had got over the wall.

He immediately gave the alarm, but it was too late. Before the guard
was ready, there were two thousand people battering the gate. The
struggle did not last long. As the guard had not kept a good watch,
they were overwhelmed. While the fight was going on, a rascally
Finn stole into the chamber of the mother, and would have done her
violence. She resisted him, and threw him down against the wall. When
he got up, he ran his sword through her: If you will not have me,
you shall have my sword. A Danish soldier came behind him and clave
his head in two. There came from it a stream of black blood and a
wreath of blue flame.

The Magy had the mother nursed on his own ship. As soon as she was well
enough to speak clearly, the Magy told her that she must sail with him,
but that she should keep her lamp and her maidens, and should hold a
station higher than she had ever done before. Moreover, he said that
he should ask her, in presence of all his chief men, if he would become
the ruler of all the country and people of Frya; that she must declare
and affirm this, or he would let her die a painful death. Then, when
he had gathered all his chiefs around her bed, he asked, in a loud
voice, Frana, since you are a prophetess, shall I become ruler over
all the lands and people of Frya? Frana did as if she took no notice
of him; but at last she opened her lips, and said: My eyes are dim,
but the other light dawns upon my soul. Yes, I see it. Hear, Irtha,
and rejoice with me. At the time of the submersion of Atland, the
first spoke of the Juul stood at the top. After that it went down,
and our freedom with it. When two spokes, or two thousand years,
shall have rolled down, the sons shall arise who have been bred
of the fornication of the princes and priests with the people, and
shall witness against their fathers. They shall all fall by murder,
but what they have proclaimed shall endure, and shall bear fruit in
the bosoms of able men, like good seed which is laid in thy lap. Yet a
thousand years shall the spoke descend, and sink deeper in darkness,
and in the blood shed over you by the wickedness of the princes and
priests. After that, the dawn shall begin to glow. When they perceive
this, the false princes and priests will strive and wrestle against
freedom; but freedom, love, and unity will take the people under their
protection, and rise out of the vile pool. The light which at first
only glimmered shall gradually become a flame. The blood of the bad
shall flow over your surface, but you must not absorb it. At last
the poisoned animals shall eat it, and die of it. All the stories
that have been written in praise of the princes and priests shall
be committed to the flames. Thenceforth your children shall live in
peace. When she had finished speaking she sank down.

The Magy, who had not understood her, shrieked out, I have asked
you if I should become master of all the lands and people of Frya,
and now you have been speaking to another. Frana raised herself up,
stared at him, and said, Before seven days have passed your soul
shall haunt the tombs with the night-birds, and your body shall be at
the bottom of the sea. Very good, said the Magy, swelling with rage;
say that I am coming. Then he said to his executioners, Throw this
woman overboard. This was the end of the last of the mothers. We do
not ask for revenge. Time will provide that; but a thousand thousand
times we will call with Frya, Watch! watch! watch!






HOW IT FARED AFTERWARDS WITH THE MAGY.


After the murder of the mother, he brought the lamp and the
maidens into his own ship, together with all the booty that he
chose. Afterwards he went up the Flymeer because he wished to take
the maiden of Medeasblik or Stavoren and install her as mother;
but there they were on their guard. The seafaring men of Stavoren
and Alderga would gladly have gone to Jon, but the great fleet was
out on a distant voyage; so they proceeded in their small fleet to
Medeasblik, and kept themselves concealed in a sheltered place behind
trees. The Magy approached Medeasblik in broad daylight; nevertheless,
his men boldly stormed the citadel. But as they landed from the boats,
our people sallied forth from the creek, and shot their arrows with
balls of burning turpentine upon the fleet. They were so well aimed
that many of the ships were instantly on fire. Those left to guard
the ships shot at us, but they could not reach us. When at last a
burning ship drifted towards the ship of the Magy, he ordered the man
at the helm to sheer off, but this man was the Dane who had cleft the
head of the Finn. He said, You sent our Eeremoeder to the bottom of
the sea to say that you were coming. In the bustle of the fight you
might forget it; now I will take care that you keep your word. The
Magy tried to push him off, but the sailor, a real Frisian and strong
as an ox, clutched his head with both hands, and pitched him into
the surging billows. Then he hoisted up his brown shield, and sailed
straight to our fleet. Thus the maidens came unhurt to us; but the
lamp was extinguished, and no one knew how that had happened. When
those on the uninjured ships heard that the Magy was drowned, they
sailed away, because their crews were Danes. When the fleet was far
enough off, our sailors turned and shot their burning arrows at the
Finns. When the Finns saw that, and found that they were betrayed,
they fell into confusion, and lost all discipline and order. At this
moment the garrison sallied forth from the citadel. Those who resisted
were killed, and those who fled found their death in the marshes of
the Krylinger wood.






POSTSCRIPT.


When the sailors were in the creek, there was a wag from Stavoren
among them, who said, Medea may well laugh if we rescue her from
her citadel. Upon this, the maidens gave to the creek the name Medea
meilakkia (Lake of Medea). The occurrences that happened after this
everybody can remember. The maidens ought to relate it in their
own way, and have it well inscribed. We consider that our task is
fulfilled. Hail!


                          THE END OF THE BOOK.






THE WRITINGS OF ADELBROST AND APOLLONIA.


My name is Adelbrost, the son of Apol and Adela. I was elected by my
people as Grevetman over the Lindaoorden. Therefore I will continue
this book in the same way as my mother has spoken it.

After the Magy was killed and Fryasburgt was restored, a mother
had to be chosen. The mother had not named her successor, and her
will was nowhere to be found. Seven months later a general assembly
was called at Grenega (Groningen), because it was on the boundary of
Saxamarken. My mother was chosen, but she would not be the mother. She
had saved my father's life, in consequence of which they had fallen
in love with each other, and she wished to marry. Many people wished
my mother to alter her decision, but she said an Eeremoeder ought to
be as pure in her conscience as she appears outwardly, and to have
the same love for all her children. Now, as I love Apol better than
anything else in the world, I cannot be such a mother. Thus spoke and
reasoned Adela, but all the other maidens wished to be the mother. Each
state was in favour of its own maiden, and would not yield. Therefore
none was chosen, and the kingdom was without any restraint. From what
follows you will understand Liudgert, the king who had lately died,
had been chosen in the lifetime of the mother, and seemingly with
the love and confidence of all the states. It was his turn to live
at the great court of Dokhem, and in the lifetime of the mother
great honour was done to him there, as there were more messengers
and knights there than had ever been seen there before. But now he
was lonely and forsaken, because every one was afraid that he would
set himself above the law, and rule them like the slave kings. Every
headman imagined that he did enough if he looked after his own state,
and did not care for the others. With the Burgtmaagden it was still
worse. Each of them depended upon her own judgment, and whenever a
Grevetman did anything without her, she raised distrust between him
and his people. If any case happened which concerned several states,
and one maid had been consulted, the rest all exclaimed that she had
spoken only in the interest of her own state. By such proceedings
they brought disputes among the states, and so severed the bond of
union that the people of one state were jealous of those of the rest,
or at least considered them as strangers; the consequence of which
was that the Gauls or Truwenden (Druids) took possession of our lands
as far as the Scheldt, and the Magy as far as the Wesara. How this
happened my mother has explained, otherwise this book would not have
been written, although I have lost all hope that it would be of any
use. I do not write in the hope that I shall win back the land or
preserve it: in my opinion that is impossible. I write only for the
future generations, that they may all know in what way we were lost,
and that each may learn that every crime brings its punishment.

My name is Apollonia. Two-and-thirty days after my mother's death
my brother Adelbrost was found murdered on the wharf, his skull
fractured and his limbs torn asunder. My father, who lay ill, died of
fright. Then my younger brother, Apol, sailed from here to the west
side of Schoonland. There he built a citadel named Lindasburgt, in
order there to avenge our wrong. Wr-alda accorded him many years for
that. He had five sons, who all caused fear to Magy, and brought fame
to my brother. After the death of my mother and my brother, all the
bravest of the land joined together and made a covenant, called the
Adelbond. In order to preserve us from injury, they brought me and my
youngest brother, Adelhirt, to the burgt--me to the maidens, and him to
the warriors. When I was thirty years old I was chosen as Burgtmaagd,
and my brother at fifty was chosen Grevetman. From mother's side my
brother was the sixth, but from father's side the third. By right,
therefore, his descendants could not put "overa Linda" after their
names, but they all wished to do it in honour of their mother. In
addition to this, there was given to us also a copy of "The Book of
Adela's Followers." That gave me the most pleasure, because it came
into the world by my mother's wisdom. In the burgt I have found other
writings also in praise of my mother. All this I will write afterwards.

These are the writings left by Bruno, who was the writer of this
burgt. After the followers of Adela had made copies, each in his
kingdom, of what was inscribed upon the walls of the burgt, they
resolved to choose a mother. For this purpose a general assembly
was called at this farm. By the first advice of Adela, Teuntje was
recommended. That would have been arranged, only that my Burgtmaagd
asked to speak: she had always supposed that she would be chosen
mother, because she was at the burgt from which mothers had generally
been chosen. When she was allowed to speak, she opened her false
lips and said: You all seem to place great value on Adela's advice,
but that shall not shut my mouth. Who is Adela, and whence comes it
that you respect her so highly? She was what I am now, a Burgtmaagd
of this place; is she, then, wiser and better than I and all the
others? or is she more conversant with our laws and customs? If that
had been the case, she would have become mother when she was chosen;
but instead of that, she preferred matrimony to a single life, watching
over herself and her people. She is certainly very clear-sighted,
but my eyes are far from being dim. I have observed that she is very
much attached to her husband, which is very praiseworthy; but I see,
likewise, that Teuntje is Apol's niece. Further I say nothing.

The principal people understood very well which way the wind
blew with her; but among the people there arose disputes, and as
most of the people came from here, they would not give the honour
to Teuntje. The conferences were ended, knives were drawn, and no
mother was chosen. Shortly afterwards one of our messengers killed his
comrade. As he had been a man of good character hitherto, my Burgtmaagd
had permission to help him over the frontier; but instead of helping
him over to Twiskland (Germany), she fled with him herself to Wesara,
and then to the Magy. The Magy, who wished to please his sons of Frya,
appointed her mother of Godaburgt, in Schoonland; but she wished for
more, and she told him that if he could get Adela out of the way
he might become master of the whole of Frya's land. She said she
hated Adela for having prevented her from being chosen mother. If
he would promise her Texland, her messenger should serve as guide to
his warriors. All this was confessed by her messenger.






THE SECOND WRITING.


Fifteen months after the last general assembly, at the festival of the
harvest month, everybody gave himself up to pleasure and merry-making,
and no one thought of anything but diversion; but Wr-alda wished
to teach us that watchfulness should never be relaxed. In the
midst of the festivities the fog came and enveloped every place in
darkness. Cheerfulness melted away, but watchfulness did not take its
place. The coastguard deserted their beacons, and no one was to be
seen on any of the paths. When the fog rose, the sun scarcely appeared
among the clouds; but the people all came out shouting with joy, and
the young folks went about singing to their bagpipes, filling the air
with their melody. But while every one was intoxicated with pleasure,
treachery had landed with its horses and riders. As usual, darkness
had favoured the wicked, and they had slipped in through the paths
of Linda's wood. Before Adela's door twelve girls led twelve lambs,
and twelve boys led twelve calves. A young Saxon bestrode a wild bull
which he had caught and tamed. They were decked with all kinds of
flowers, and the girls' dresses were fringed with gold from the Rhine.

When Adela came out of her house, a shower of flowers fell on her head;
they all cheered loudly, and the fifes of the boys were heard over
everything. Poor Adela! poor people! how short will be your joy! When
the procession was out of sight, a troop of Magyar soldiers rushed
up to Adela's house. Her father and her husband were sitting on the
steps. The door was open, and within stood Adelbrost her son. When he
saw the danger of his parents, he took his bow from the wall and shot
the leader of the pirates, who staggered and fell on the grass. The
second and third met a similar fate. In the meantime his parents had
seized their weapons, and went slowly to Jon's house. They would soon
have been taken, but Adela came. She had learned in the burgt to use
all kinds of weapons. She was seven feet high, and her sword was the
same length. She waved it three times over her head, and each time
a knight bit the earth. Reinforcements came, and the pirates were
made prisoners; but too late--an arrow had penetrated her bosom! The
treacherous Magy had poisoned it, and she died of it.






THE ELEGY OF THE BURGTMAAGD.


Yes, departed friend, thousands are arrived, and more are coming. They
wish to hear the wisdom of Adela. Truly, she was a princess, for she
had always been the leader. O Sorrow, what good can you do!

Her garments of linen and wool she spun and wove herself. How
could she add to her beauty? Not with pearls, for her teeth were
more white; not with gold, for her tresses were more brilliant; not
with precious stones, for her eyes, though soft as those of a lamb,
were so lustrous that you could scarcely look into them. But why
do I talk of beauty? Frya was certainly not more beautiful; yes, my
friends, Frya, who possessed seven perfections, of which each of her
daughters inherited one, or at most three. But even if she had been
ugly, she would still have been dear to us. Is she warlike? Listen, my
friend. Adela was the only daughter of our Grevetman. She stood seven
feet high. Her wisdom exceeded her stature, and her courage was equal
to both together. Here is an instance. There was once a turf-ground on
fire. Three children got upon yonder gravestone. There was a furious
wind. The people were all shouting, and the mother was helpless. Then
came Adela. What are you all standing still here for? she cried. Try
to help them, and Wr-alda will give you strength. Then she ran
to the Krylwood and got some elder branches, of which she made a
bridge. The others then came to assist her, and the children were
saved. The children bring flowers to the place every year. There came
once three Phoenician sailors, who began to ill-treat the children,
when Adela, having heard their screams, beat the scoundrels till they
were insensible, and then, to prove to them what miserable wretches
they were, she tied them all three to a spindle.

The foreign lords came to look after their people, and when they saw
how ridiculously they had been treated they were very angry, till
they were told what had happened. Upon that they bowed themselves
before Adela, and kissed the hem of her garment. But come, distant
living friend. The birds of the forest fled before the numerous
visitors. Come, friend, and you shall hear her wisdom. By the
gravestone of which mention has already been made her body is
buried. Upon the stone the following words are inscribed:--


        Tread softly, for here lies Adela.


The old legend which is written on the outside wall of the city tower
is not written in "The Book of Adela's Followers." Why this has been
neglected I do not know; but this book is my own, so I will put it
in out of regard to my relations.






THE OLDEST DOCTRINE.


Hail to all the well-intentioned children of Frya! Through them the
earth shall become holy. Learn and announce to the people Wr-alda is
the ancient of ancients, for he created all things. Wr-alda is all in
all, for he is eternal and everlasting. Wr-alda is omnipresent but
invisible, and therefore is called a spirit. All that we can see of
him are the created beings who come to life through him and go again,
because from Wr-alda all things proceed and return to him. Wr-alda is
the beginning and the end. Wr-alda is the only almighty being, because
from him all other strength comes, and returns to him. Therefore
he alone is the creator, and nothing exists without him. Wr-alda
established eternal principles, upon which the laws of creation were
founded, and no good laws could stand on any other foundation. But
although everything is derived from Wr-alda, the wickedness of men
does not come from him. Wickedness comes from heaviness, carelessness,
and stupidity; therefore they may well be injurious to men, but never
to Wr-alda. Wr-alda is wisdom, and the laws that he has made are the
books from which we learn, nor is any wisdom to be found or gathered
but in them. Men may see a great deal, but Wr-alda sees everything. Men
can learn a great deal, but Wr-alda knows everything. Men can discover
much, but to Wr-alda everything is open. Mankind are male and female,
but Wr-alda created both. Mankind love and hate, but Wr-alda alone
is just. Therefore Wr-alda is good, and there is no good without
him. In the progress of time all creation alters and changes, but
goodness alone is unalterable; and since Wr-alda is good, he cannot
change. As he endures, he alone exists; everything else is show.






THE SECOND PART OF THE OLDEST DOCTRINE.


Among Finda's people there are false teachers, who, by their
over-inventiveness, have become so wicked that they make themselves
and their adherents believe that they are the best part of Wr-alda,
that their spirit is the best part of Wr-alda's spirit, and that
Wr-alda can only think by the help of their brains.

That every creature is a part of Wr-alda's eternal being, that they
have stolen from us; but their false reasoning and ungovernable pride
have brought them on the road to ruin. If their spirit was Wr-alda's
spirit, then Wr-alda would be very stupid, instead of being sensible
and wise; for their spirit labours to create beautiful statues,
which they afterwards worship. Finda's people are a wicked people,
for although they presumptuously pretend among themselves that they
are gods, they proclaim the unconsecrated false gods, and declare
everywhere that these idols created the world and all that therein
is--greedy idols, full of envy and anger, who desire to be served
and honoured by the people, and who exact bloody sacrifices and rich
offerings; but these presumptuous and false men, who call themselves
God's servants and priests, receive and collect everything in the
name of the idols that have no real existence, for their own benefit.

They do all this with an easy conscience, as they think themselves
gods not answerable to any one. If there are some who discover their
tricks and expose them, they hand them over to the executioners to
be burnt for their calumnies, with solemn ceremonies in honour of the
false gods; but really in order to save themselves. In order that our
children may be protected against their idolatrous doctrine, the duty
of the maidens is to make them learn by heart the following: Wr-alda
existed before all things, and will endure after all things. Wr-alda
is also eternal and everlasting, therefore nothing exists without
him. From Wr-alda's life sprang time and all living things, and his
life takes away time and every other thing. These things must be made
clear and manifest in every way, so that they can be made clear and
comprehensible to all. When we have learned thus much, then we say
further: In what regards our existence, we are a part of Wr-alda's
everlasting being, like the existence of all created beings; but as
regards our form, our qualities, our spirit, and all our thoughts,
these do not belong to the being. All these are passing things which
appear through Wr-alda's life, and which appear through his wisdom,
and not otherwise; but whereas his life is continually progressing,
nothing can remain stationary, therefore all created things change
their locality, their form, and their thoughts. So neither the earth
nor any other created object can say, I am; but rather, I was. So no
man can say, I think; but rather, I thought. The boy is greater and
different from the child; he has different desires, inclinations,
and thoughts. The man and father feels and thinks differently from
the boy, the old man just the same. Everybody knows that. Besides,
everybody knows and must acknowledge that he is now changing, that he
changes every minute even while he says, I am, and that his thoughts
change even while he says, I think. Instead, then, of imitating
Finda's wicked people, and saying, I am the best part of Wr-alda,
and through us alone he can think, we proclaim everywhere where it
is necessary, We, Frya's children, exist through Wr-alda's life--in
the beginning mean and base, but always advancing towards perfection
without ever attaining the excellence of Wr-alda himself. Our spirit
is not Wr-alda's spirit, it is merely a shadow of it. When Wr-alda
created us, he lent us his wisdom, brains, organs, memory, and many
other good qualities. By this means we are able to contemplate his
creatures and his laws; by this means we can learn and can speak of
them always, and only for our own benefit. If Wr-alda had given us
no organs, we should have known nothing, and been more irrational
than a piece of sea-weed driven up and down by the ebb and flood.






THIS IS WRITTEN ON PARCHMENT--"SKRIVFILT." SPEECH AND ANSWER TO OTHER
MAIDENS AS AN EXAMPLE.


An unsociable, avaricious man came to complain to Troost, who was the
maid of Stavia. He said a thunderstorm had destroyed his house. He
had prayed to Wr-alda, but Wr-alda had given him no help. Are you
a true Frisian? Troost asked. From father and forefathers, replied
the man. Then she said, I will sow something in your conscience,
in confidence that it will take root, grow, and bear fruit. She
continued, When Frya was born, our mother stood naked and bare,
unprotected from the rays of the sun. She could ask no one, and
there was no one who could give her any help. Then Wr-alda wrought
in her conscience inclination and love, anxiety and fright. She
looked round her, and her inclination chose the best. She sought a
hiding-place under the sheltering lime-trees, but the rain came, and
the difficulty was that she got wet. She had seen how the water ran
down the pendent leaves; so she made a roof of leaves fastened with
sticks, but the wind blew the rain under it. She observed that the
stem would afford protection. She then built a wall of sods, first on
one side, and then all round. The wind grew stronger and blew away the
roof, but she made no complaint of Wr-alda. She made a roof of rushes,
and put stones upon it. Having found how hard it is to toil alone,
she showed her children how and why she had done it. They acted and
thought as she did. This is the way in which we became possessed
of houses and porches, a street, and lime-trees to protect us from
the rays of the sun. At last we have built a citadel, and all the
rest. If your house is not strong enough, then you must try and make
another. My house was strong enough, he said, but the flood and the
wind destroyed it. Where did your house stand? Troost asked. On the
bank of the Rhine, he answered. Did it not stand on a knoll? Troost
asked. No, said the man; my house stood alone on the bank. I built
it alone, but I could not alone make a hillock. I knew it, Troost
answered; the maidens told me. All your life you have avoided your
neighbours, fearing that you might have to give or do something for
them; but one cannot get on in the world in that way, for Wr-alda,
who is kind, turns away from the niggardly. Fasta has advised us,
and it is engraved in stone over all our doors. If you are selfish,
distrustful towards your neighbours, teach your neighbours, help your
neighbours, and they will return the same to you. If this advice is
not good enough for you, I can give you no better. The man blushed
for shame, and slunk away.






NOW I WILL WRITE MYSELF, FIRST ABOUT MY CITADEL, AND THEN ABOUT WHAT
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE.


My city lies near the north end of the Liudgaarde. The tower has six
sides, and is ninety feet high, flat-roofed, with a small house upon
it out of which they look at the stars. On either side of the tower
is a house three hundred feet long, and twenty-one feet broad, and
twenty-one feet high, besides the roof, which is round. All this is
built of hard-baked bricks, and outside there is nothing else. The
citadel is surrounded by a dyke, with a moat thirty-six feet broad
and twenty-one feet deep. If one looks down from the tower, he sees
the form of the Juul. In the ground among the houses on the south
side all kinds of native and foreign herbs grow, of which the maidens
must study the qualities. Among the houses on the north side there
are only fields. The three houses on the north are full of corn and
other necessaries; the two houses on the south are for the maidens
to live in and keep school. The most southern house is the dwelling
of the Burgtmaagd. In the tower hangs the lamp. The walls of the
tower are decorated with precious stones. On the south wall the Tex
is inscribed. On the right side of this are the formulae, and on the
other side the laws; the other things are found upon the three other
sides. Against the dyke, near the house of the Burgtmaagd, stand the
oven and the mill, worked by four oxen. Outside the citadel wall is the
place where the Burgtheeren and the soldiers live. The fortification
outside is an hour long--not a seaman's hour, but an hour of the sun,
of which twenty-four go to a day. Inside it is a plain five feet
below the top. On it are three hundred crossbows covered with wood
and leather.

Besides the houses of the inhabitants, there are along the inside
of the dyke thirty-six refuge-houses for the people who live in the
neighbourhood. The field serves for a camp and for a meadow. On the
south side of the outer fortification is the Liudgaarde, enclosed by
the great wood of lime-trees. Its shape is three-cornered, with the
widest part outside, so that the sun may shine in it, for there are a
great number of foreign trees and flowers brought by the seafarers. All
the other citadels are the same shape as ours, only not so large;
but the largest of all is that of Texland. The tower of the Fryaburgt
is so high that it rends the sky, and all the rest is in proportion
to the tower. In our citadel this is the arrangement: Seven young
maidens attend to the lamp; each watch is three hours. In the rest of
their time they do housework, learn, and sleep. When they have watched
for seven years, they are free; then they may go among the people,
to look after their morals and to give advice. When they have been
three years maidens, they may sometimes accompany the older ones.

The writer must teach the girls to read, to write, and to reckon. The
elders, or "Greva," must teach them justice and duty, morals, botany,
and medicine, history, traditions, and singing, besides all that may be
necessary for them to give advice. The Burgtmaagd must teach them how
to set to work when they go among the people. Before a Burgtmaagd can
take office, she must travel through the country a whole year. Three
grey-headed Burgtheeren and three old maidens must go with her. This
was the way that I did. My journey was along the Rhine--on this side
up, and on the other side down. The higher I went, the poorer the
people seemed to be. Everywhere about the Rhine the people dug holes,
and the sand that was got out was poured with water over fleeces to
get the gold, but the girls did not wear golden crowns of it. Formerly
they were more numerous, but since we lost Schoonland they have gone
up to the mountains. There they dig ore and make iron. Above the Rhine
among the mountains I have seen Marsaten. The Marsaten are people who
live on the lakes. Their houses are built upon piles, for protection
from the wild beasts and wicked people. There are wolves, bears, and
horrible lions. Then come the Swiss, the nearest to the frontiers of
the distant Italians, the followers of Kalta and the savage Twiskar,
all greedy for robbery and booty. The Marsaten gain their livelihood
by fishing and hunting. The skins are sewn together by the women,
and prepared with birch bark. The small skins are as soft as a woman's
skin. The Burgtmaagd at Fryasburgt (Freiburg) told us that they were
good, simple people; but if I had not heard her speak of them first,
I should have thought that they were not Frya's people, they looked
so impudent. Their wool and herbs are bought by the Rhine people, and
taken to foreign countries by the ship captains. Along the other side
of the Rhine it was just the same as at Lydasburcht (Leiden). There
was a great river or lake, and upon this lake also there were people
living upon piles. But they were not Frya's people; they were black
and brown men who had been employed as rowers to bring home the men
who had been making foreign voyages, and they had to stay there till
the fleet went back.

At last we came to Alderga. At the head of the south harbour lies the
Waraburgt, built of stone, in which all kinds of clothes, weapons,
shells, and horns are kept, which were brought by the sea-people from
distant lands. A quarter of an hour's distance from there is Alderga,
a great river surrounded by houses, sheds, and gardens, all richly
decorated. In the river lay a great fleet ready, with banners of
all sorts of colours. On Frya's day the shields were hung on board
likewise. Some shone like the sun. The shields of the sea-king and
the admiral were bordered with gold. From the river a canal was dug
going past the citadel Forana (Vroonen), with a narrow outlet to the
sea. This was the egress of the fleet; the Fly was the ingress. On
both sides of the river are fine houses built, painted in bright
colours. The gardens are all surrounded by green hedges. I saw there
women wearing felt tunics, as if it were writing felt. [3] Just as at
Staveren, the girls wore golden crowns on their heads, and rings on
their arms and ankles. To the south of Forana lies Alkmarum. Alkmarum
is a lake or river in which there is an island. On this island the
black and brown people must remain, the same as at Lydasburgt. The
Burgtmaagd of Forana told me that the burgtheeren go every day to teach
them what real freedom is, and how it behoves men to live in order to
obtain the blessing of Wr-alda's spirit. If there was any one who was
willing to listen and could comprehend, he was kept there till he was
fully taught. That was done in order to instruct the distant people,
and to make friends everywhere. I had been before in the Saxenmarken,
at the Mannagardaforde castle (Munster). There I saw more poverty
than I could discover wealth here. She answered: So whenever at
the Saxenmarken a young man courts a young girl, the girls ask: Can
you keep your house free from the banished Twisklanders? Have you
ever killed any of them? How many cattle have you already caught,
and how many bear and wolfskins have you brought to market? And
from this it comes that the Saxons have left the cultivation of
the soil to the women, that not one in a hundred can read or write;
from this it comes, too, that no one has a motto on his shield, but
only a misshapen form of some animal that he has killed; and lastly,
from this comes also that they are very warlike, but sometimes as
stupid as the beasts that they catch, and as poor as the Twisklanders
with whom they go to war. The earth and the sea were made for Frya's
people. All our rivers run into the sea. The Lydas people and the
Findas people will exterminate each other, and we must people the
empty countries. In movement and sailing is our prosperity. If you
wish the highlanders to share our riches and wisdom, I will give
you a piece of advice. Let the girls, when they are asked to marry,
before they say yes, ask their lovers: What parts of the world have
you travelled in? What can you tell your children about distant lands
and distant people? If they do this, then the young warriors will
come to us; they will become wiser and richer, and we shall have no
occasion to deal with those nasty people. The youngest of the maids
who were with me came from the Saxenmarken. When we came back she
asked leave to go home. Afterwards she became Burgtmaagd there, and
that is the reason why in these days so many of our sailors are Saxons.


                        END OF APOLLONIA'S BOOK.






THE WRITINGS OF FRETHORIK AND WILJOW.


My name is Frethorik, surnamed oera Linda, which means over the
Linden. In Ljudwardia I was chosen as Asga. Ljudwardia is a new
village within the fortification of the Ljudgaarda, of which the
name has fallen into disrepute. In my time much has happened. I had
written a good deal about it, but afterwards much more was related to
me. I will write an account of both one and the other after this book,
to the honour of the good people and to the disgrace of the bad.

In my youth I heard complaints on all sides. The bad time was coming;
the bad time did come--Frya had forsaken us. She withheld from us all
her watch-maidens, because monstrous idolatrous images had been found
within our landmarks. I burnt with curiosity to see those images. In
our neighbourhood a little old woman tottered in and out of the houses,
always calling out about the bad times. I came to her; she stroked
my chin; then I became bold, and asked her if she would show me the
bad times and the images. She laughed good-naturedly, and took me
to the citadel. An old man asked me if I could read and write. No,
I said. Then you must first go and learn, he replied, otherwise it
may not be shown to you. I went daily to the writer and learnt. Eight
years afterwards I heard that our Burgtmaagd had been unchaste, and
that some of the burgtheeren had committed treason with the Magy, and
many people took their part. Everywhere disputes arose. There were
children rebelling against their parents; good people were secretly
murdered. The little old woman who had brought everything to light
was found dead in a ditch. My father, who was a judge, would have
her avenged. He was murdered in the night in his own house. Three
years after that the Magy was master without any resistance. The
Saxmen had remained religious and upright. All the good people fled
to them. My mother died of it. Now I did like the others. The Magy
prided himself upon his cunning, but Irtha made him know that she
would not tolerate any Magy or idol on the holy bosom that had borne
Frya. As a wild horse tosses his mane after he has thrown his rider,
so Irtha shook her forests and her mountains. Rivers flowed over the
land; the sea raged; mountains spouted fire to the clouds, and what
they vomited forth the clouds flung upon the earth. At the beginning
of the Arnemaand (harvest month) the earth bowed towards the north,
and sank down lower and lower. In the Welvenmaand (winter month)
the low lands of Fryasland were buried under the sea. The woods in
which the images were, were torn up and scattered by the wind. The
following year the frost came in the Hardemaand (Louwmaand, January),
and laid Fryasland concealed under a sheet of ice. In Sellemaand
(Sprokkelmaand, February) there were storms of wind from the north,
driving mountains of ice and stones. When the spring-tides came the
earth raised herself up, the ice melted; with the ebb the forests
with the images drifted out to sea. In the Winne, or Minnemaand
(Bloeimaand, May), every one who dared went home. I came with a maiden
to the citadel Liudgaarde. How sad it looked there. The forests of
the Lindaoorden were almost all gone. Where Liudgaarde used to be was
sea. The waves swept over the fortifications. Ice had destroyed the
tower, and the houses lay heaped over each other. On the slope of the
dyke I found a stone on which the writer had inscribed his name. That
was a sign to me. The same thing had happened to other citadels as
to ours. In the upper lands they had been destroyed by the earth, in
the lower lands by the water. Fryasburgt, at Texland, was the only one
found uninjured, but all the land to the north was sunk under the sea,
and has never been recovered. At the mouth of the Flymeer, as we were
told, thirty salt swamps were found, consisting of the forest and the
ground that had been swept away. At Westflyland there were fifty. The
canal which had run across the land from Alderga was filled up with
sand and destroyed. The seafaring people and other travellers who
were at home had saved themselves, their goods, and their relations
upon their ships. But the black people at Lydasburgt and Alkmarum
had done the same; and as they went south they saved many girls, and
as no one came to claim them, they took them for their wives. The
people who came back all lived within the lines of the citadel, as
outside there was nothing but mud and marsh. The old houses were all
smashed together. People bought cattle and sheep from the upper lands,
and in the great houses where formerly the maidens were established
cloth and felt were made for a livelihood. This happened 1888 years
after the submersion of Atland.

For 282 years we had not had an Eeremoeder, and now, when everything
seemed lost, they set about choosing one. The lot fell upon Gosa,
surnamed Makonta. She was Burgtmaagd at Fryasburgt, in Texland. She
had a clear head and strong sense, and was very good; and as her
citadel was the only one that had been spared, every one saw in that
her call. Ten years after that the seafarers came from Forana and
Lydasburgt. They wished to drive the black men, with their wives and
children, out of the country. They wished to obtain the opinion of
the mother upon the subject. She asked them: Can you send them all
back to their country? If so, then lose no time, or they will find
no relatives alive. No, they said. Gosa replied: They have eaten
your bread and salt; they have placed themselves entirely under
your protection. You must consult your own hearts. But I will give
you one piece of advice. Keep them till you are able to send them
back, but keep them outside your citadels. Watch over their morals,
and educate them as if they were Frya's sons. Their women are the
strongest here. Their blood will disappear like smoke, till at last
nothing but Frya's blood will remain in their descendants. So they
remained here. Now, I should wish that my descendants should observe
in how far Gosa spoke the truth. When our country began to recover,
there came troops of poor Saxon men and women to the neighbourhoods
of Staveren and Alderga, to search for gold and other treasures in
the swampy lands. But the sea-people would not permit it, so they
went and settled in the empty village of the West Flyland in order
to preserve their lives.






NOW I WILL RELATE HOW THE GEERTMAN AND MANY FOLLOWERS OF HELLENIA
CAME BACK.


Two years after Gosa had become the mother (303 B.C.) there
arrived a fleet at Flymeer. The people shouted "Ho-n-seen" (What a
blessing). They sailed to Staveren, where they shouted again. Their
flags were hoisted, and at night they shot lighted arrows into the
air. At daylight some of them rowed into the harbour in a boat,
shouting again, "Ho-n-seen." When they landed a young fellow jumped
upon the rampart. In his hand he held a shield on which bread and salt
were laid. After him came a grey-headed man, who said we come from
the distant Greek land to preserve our customs. Now we wish you to
be kind enough to give us as much land as will enable us to live. He
told a long story, which I will hereafter relate more fully. The old
man did not know what to do. They sent messengers all round, also to
me. I went, and said now that we have a mother it behoves us to ask
her advice. I went with them myself. The mother, who already knew
it all, said: Let them come, they will help us to keep our lands,
but do not let them remain in one place, that they may not become
too powerful over us. We did as she said, which was quite to their
liking. Fryso remained with his people at Staveren, which they made
again into a port as well as they could. Wichhirte went with his people
eastwards to the Emude. Some of the descendants of Jon who imagined
that they sprang from the Alderga people went there. A small number,
who fancied that their forefathers had come from the seven islands,
went there and set themselves down within the enclosure of the citadel
of Walhallagara. Liudgert, the admiral of Wichhirt, was my comrade,
and afterwards my friend. Out of his diary I have taken the following
history.

After we had been settled 12 times 100 and twice 12 years in the Five
Waters (Punjab), whilst our naval warriors were navigating all the
seas they could find, came Alexander the King, with a powerful army
descending the river towards our villages. No one could withstand him;
but we sea-people, who lived by the sea, put all our possessions on
board ships and took our departure. When Alexander heard that such
a large fleet had escaped him, he became furious, and swore that
he would burn all the villages if we did not come back. Wichhirte
was ill in bed. When Alexander heard that, he waited till he was
better. After that he came to him, speaking very kindly--but he
deceived, as he had done before. Wichhirte answered: Oh greatest of
kings, we sailors go everywhere; we have heard of your great deeds,
therefore we are full of respect for your arms, and still more for
your wisdom; but we who are free-born Fryas children, we may not
become your slaves; and even if I would, the others would sooner
die, for so it is commanded in our laws. Alexander said: I do not
desire to take your land or make slaves of your people, I only wish
to hire your services. That I will swear by both our Gods, so that
no one may be dissatisfied. When Alexander shared bread and salt
with him, Wichhirte had chosen the wisest part. He let his son fetch
the ships. When they were all come back Alexander hired them all. By
means of them he wished to transport his people to the holy Ganges,
which he had not been able to reach. Then he chose among all his
people and soldiers those who were accustomed to the sea. Wichhirte
had fallen sick again, therefore I went alone with Nearchus, sent by
the king. The voyage came to an end without any advantage, because the
Joniers and the Phoenicians were always quarrelling, so that Nearchus
himself could not keep them in order. In the meantime, the king had
not sat still. He had let his soldiers cut down trees and make planks,
with which, with the help of our carpenters, he had built ships. Now he
would himself become a sea-king, and sail with his whole army up the
Ganges; but the soldiers who came from the mountainous countries were
afraid of the sea. When they heard that they must sail, they set fire
to the timber yards, and so our whole village was laid in ashes. At
first we thought that this had been done by Alexander's orders, and
we were all ready to cast ourselves into the sea: but Alexander was
furious, and wished his own people to kill the soldiers. However,
Nearchus, who was not only his chief officer, but also his friend,
advised him not to do so. So he pretended to believe that it had
happened by accident, and said no more about it. He wished now
to return, but before going he made an inquiry who really were the
guilty ones. As soon as he ascertained it, he had them all disarmed,
and made them build a new village. His own people he kept under arms to
overawe the others, and to build a citadel. We were to take the women
and children with us. When we arrived at the mouth of the Euphrates,
we might either choose a place to settle there or come back. Our pay
would be guaranteed to us the same in either case. Upon the new ships
which had been saved from the fire he embarked the Joniers and the
Greeks. He himself went with the rest of his people along the coast,
through the barren wilderness; that is, through the land that Irtha
had heaved up out of the sea when she had raised up the strait as
soon as our forefathers had passed into the Red Sea.

When we arrived at New Gertmania (New Gertmania is the port that
we had made in order to take in water), we met Alexander with his
army. Nearchus went ashore, and stayed three days. Then we proceeded
further on. When we came to the Euphrates, Nearchus went ashore
with the soldiers and a large body of people; but he soon returned,
and said, The King requests you, for his sake, to go a voyage up
the Red Sea; after that each shall receive as much gold as he can
carry. When we arrived there, he showed us where the strait had
formerly been. There he spent thirty-one days, always looking steadily
towards the desert.

At last there arrived a great troop of people, bringing with them 200
elephants, 1000 camels, a quantity of timber, ropes, and all kinds of
implements necessary to drag our fleet to the Mediterranean Sea. This
astounded us, and seemed most extraordinary; but Nearchus told us that
his king wished to show to the other kings that he was more powerful
than any kings of Tyre had ever been. We were only to assist, and that
surely could do us no harm. We were obliged to yield, and Nearchus
knew so well how to regulate everything, that before three months
had elapsed our ships lay in the Mediterranean Sea. When Alexander
ascertained how his project had succeeded, he became so audacious
that he wished to dig out the dried-up strait in defiance of Irtha;
but Wr-alda deserted his soul, so that he destroyed himself by wine
and rashness before he could begin it. After his death his kingdom
was divided among his princes. They were each to have preserved a
share for his sons, but that was not their intention. Each wished
to keep his own share, and to get more. Then war arose, and we could
not return. Nearchus wished us to settle on the coast of Phoenicia,
but that no one would do. We said we would rather risk the attempt to
return to Fryasland. Then he brought us to the new port of Athens,
where all the true children of Frya had formerly gone. We went,
soldiers with our goods and weapons. Among the many princes Nearchus
had a friend named Antigonus. These two had only one object in view,
as they told us--to help the royal race, and to restore freedom to
all the Greek lands. Antigonus had, among many others, one son named
Demetrius, afterwards called the "City Winner." He went once to the
town of Salamis, and after he had been some time fighting there, he
had an engagement with the fleet of Ptolemy. Ptolemy was the name of
the prince who reigned over Egypt. Demetrius won the battle, not by
his own soldiers, but because we helped him. We had done this out
of friendship for Nearchus, because we knew that he was of bastard
birth by his white skin, blue eyes, and fair hair. Afterwards,
Demetrius attacked Rhodes, and we transported thither his soldiers
and provisions. When we made our last voyage to Rhodes, the war
was finished. Demetrius had sailed to Athens. When we came into the
harbour, the whole village was in deep mourning. Friso, who was king
over the fleet, had a son and a daughter so remarkably fair, as if
they had just come out of Fryasland, and more beautiful than any one
could picture to himself. The fame of this went all over Greece, and
came to the ears of Demetrius. Demetrius was vile and immoral, and
thought he could do as he pleased. He carried off the daughter. The
mother did not dare await the return of her joi (the sailors wives
call their husbands joi or zoethart (sweetheart). The men call their
wives troost (comfort) and fro or frow, that is, vreuyde (delight)
and frolic; that is the same as vreugde.)

As she dared not wait for her husband's return, she went with her
son to Demetrius, and implored him to send back her daughter; but
when Demetrius saw the son he had him taken to his palace, and did
to him as he had done to his sister. He sent a bag of gold to the
mother, which she flung into the sea. When she came home she was out
of her mind, and ran about the streets calling out: Have you seen my
children. Woe is me! let me find a place to hide in, for my husband
will kill me because I have lost his children.

When Demetrius heard that Friso had come home, he sent messengers
to him to say that he had taken his children to raise them to high
rank, and to reward him for his services. But Friso was proud and
passionate, and sent a messenger with a letter to his children, in
which he recommended them to accept the will of Demetrius, as he
wished to promote their happiness; but the messenger had another
letter with poison, which he ordered them to take: But, said he,
your bodies have been defiled against your will. That you are not to
blame for; but if your souls are not pure, you will never come into
Walhalla. Your spirits will haunt the earth in darkness. Like the bats
and owls, you will hide yourselves in the daytime in holes, and in
the night will come and shriek and cry about our graves, while Frya
must turn her head away from you. The children did as their father
had commanded. The messenger had their bodies thrown into the sea,
and it was reported that they had fled. Now Friso wished to go with
all his people to Frya's land, where he had been formerly, but most of
them would not go. So Friso set fire to the village and all the royal
storehouses; then no one could remain there, and all were glad to be
out of it. We left everything behind us except wives and children,
but we had an ample stock of provisions and warlike implements.

Friso was not yet satisfied. When we came to the old harbour, he went
off with his stout soldiers and threw fire into all the ships that
he could reach with his arrows. Six days later we saw the war-fleet
of Demetrius coming down upon us. Friso ordered us to keep back the
small ships in a broad line, and to put the large ships with the women
and children in front. Further, he ordered us to take the crossbows
that were in the fore part and fix them on the sterns of the ships,
because, said he, we must fight a retreating battle. No man must
presume to pursue a single enemy--that is my order. While we were
busy about this, all at once the wind came ahead, to the great alarm
of the cowards and the women, because we had no slaves except those
who had voluntarily followed us. Therefore we could not escape the
enemy by rowing. But Wr-alda knew well why he did this; and Friso,
who understood it, immediately had the fire-arrows placed on the
crossbows. At the same time he gave the order that no one should shoot
before he did, and that we should all aim at the centre ship. If we
succeeded in this, he said, the others would all go to its assistance,
and then everybody might shoot as he best was able. When we were at
a cable and a half distance from them the Phoenicians began to shoot,
but Friso did not reply till the first arrow fell six fathoms from his
ship. Then he fired, and the rest followed. It was like a shower of
fire; and as our arrows went with the wind, they all remained alight
and reached the third line. Everybody shouted and cheered, but the
screams of our opponents were so loud that our hearts shrank. When
Friso thought that it was sufficient he called us off, and we sped
away; but after two days' slow sailing another fleet of thirty ships
came in sight and gained upon us. Friso cleared for action again,
but the others sent forward a small rowing-boat with messengers,
who asked permission to sail with us, as they were Joniers. They
had been compelled by Demetrius to go to the old haven; there they
had heard of the battle, and girding on their stout swords, had
followed us. Friso, who had sailed a good deal with the Joniers,
said Yes; but Wichirte, our king, said No. The Joniers, said he,
are worshippers of heathen gods; I myself have heard them call upon
them. That comes from their intercourse with the real Greeks, Friso
said. I have often done it myself, and yet I am as pious a Fryas man
as any of you. Friso was the man to take us to Friesland, therefore
the Joniers went with us. It seems that this was pleasing to Wr-alda,
for before three months were past we coasted along Britain, and three
days later we could shout huzza.






THIS WRITING HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ME ABOUT NORTHLAND AND SCHOONLAND
(SCANDINAVIA).


When our land was submerged I was in Schoonland. It was very bad
there. There were great lakes which rose from the earth like bubbles,
then burst asunder, and from the rents flowed a stuff like red-hot
iron. The tops of high mountains fell and destroyed whole forests
and villages. I myself saw one mountain torn from another and fall
straight down. When I afterwards went to see the place there was
a lake there. When the earth was composed there came a duke of
Lindasburgt with his people, and one maiden who cried everywhere,
Magy is the cause of all the misery that we have suffered. They
continued their progress, and their hosts increased. The Magy fled,
and his corpse was found where he had killed himself. Then the Finns
were driven to one place where they might live. There were some of
mixed blood who were allowed to stay, but most of them went with the
Finns. The duke was chosen as king. The temples which had remained
whole were destroyed. Since that time the good Northmen come often to
Texland for the advice of the mother; still we cannot consider them
real Frisians. In Denmark it has certainly happened as with us. The
sea-people, who call themselves famous sea-warriors, went on board
their ships, and afterwards went back again.

                                 Hail!

Whenever the Carrier has completed a period, then posterity shall
understand that the faults and misdeeds that the Brokmannen have
brought with them belonged to their forefathers; therefore I will
watch, and will describe as much of their manners as I have seen. The
Geertmannen I can readily pass by. I have not had much to do with them,
but as far as I have seen they have mostly retained their language and
customs. I cannot say that of the others. Those who descend from the
Greeks speak a bad language, and have not much to boast of in their
manners. Many have brown eyes and hair. They are envious and impudent,
and cowardly from superstition. When they speak, they put the words
first that ought to come last. For old they at; for salt, sat; and for
man, ma--too many to mention. They also use abbreviations of names,
which have no meaning. The Joniers speak better, but they drop the
H, and put it where it ought not to be. When they make a statue of
a dead person they believe that the spirit of the departed enters
into it; therefore they have hidden their statues of Frya, Fasta,
Medea, Thiania, Hellenia, and many others. When a child is born, all
the relatives come together and pray to Frya to send her servants to
bless the child. When they have prayed, they must neither move nor
speak. If the child begins to cry, and continues some time, it is a
bad sign, and they suspect that the mother has committed adultery. I
have seen very bad things come from that. If the child sleeps, that
is a good sign--Frya's servants are come. If it laughs in its sleep,
the servants have promised it happiness. Moreover, they believe in bad
spirits, witches, sorcerers, dwarfs, and elves, as if they descended
from the Finns. Herewith I will finish, and I think I have written
more than any of my forefathers. Frethorik.

Frethorik, my husband, lived to the age of 63. Since 108 years he
is the first of his race who died a peaceable death; all the others
died by violence, because they all fought with their own people,
and with foreigners for right and duty.

My name is Wiljo. I am the maiden who came home with him from
Saxsenmarken. In the course of conversation it came out that we
were both of Adela's race--thus our affection commenced, and we
became man and wife. He left me with five children, two sons and
three daughters. Konreed was my eldest son, Hachgana my second. My
eldest daughter is called Adela, my second Frulik, and the youngest
Nocht. When I went to Saxsenmarken I preserved three books--the book
of songs, the book of narratives, and the Hellenia book.

I write this in order that people may not think they were by
Apollonia. I have had a good deal of annoyance about this, and
therefore now wish to have the honour of it. I also did more. When
Gosa Makonta died, whose goodness and clear-sightedness have become
a proverb, I went alone to Texland to copy the writings that she had
left; and when the last will of Frana was found, and the writings
left by Adela or Hellenia, I did that again. These are the writings
of Hellenia. I have put them first because they are the oldest.


                       HAIL TO ALL TRUE FRISIANS.


In the olden times, the Slavonic race knew nothing of liberty. They
were brought under the yoke like oxen. They were driven into the
bowels of the earth to dig metals, and had to build houses of stone as
dwelling-places for princes and priests. Of all that they did nothing
came to themselves, everything must serve to enrich and make more
powerful the priests and the princes, and to satisfy them. Under this
treatment they grew gray and old before their time, and died without
any enjoyment; although the earth produces abundantly for the good of
all her children. But our runaways and exiles came through Twiskland
to their boundaries, and our sailors came to their harbours. From
them they heard of liberty, of justice, and laws, without which
men cannot exist. This was all absorbed by the unhappy people like
dew into an arid soil. When they fully understood this, the most
courageous among them began to clank their chains, which grieved the
princes. The princes are proud and warlike; there is therefore some
virtue in their hearts. They consulted together and bestowed some of
their superfluity; but the cowardly hypocritical priests could not
suffer this. Among their false gods they had invented also wicked
cruel monsters. Pestilence broke out in the country; and they said
that the gods were angry with the domineering of the wicked. Then the
boldest of the people were strangled in their chains. The earth drank
their blood, and that blood produced corn and fruits that inspired
with wisdom those who ate them.

Sixteen hundred years ago (she writes, 593 B.C.), Atland was submerged;
and at that time something happened which nobody had reckoned upon. In
the heart of Findasland, upon a mountain, lies a plain called Kasamyr
(Cashmere) that is "extraordinary." There was a child born whose mother
was the daughter of a king, and whose father was a high-priest. In
order to hide the shame they were obliged to renounce their own
blood. Therefore it was taken out of the town to poor people. As the
boy grew up, nothing was concealed from him, so he did all in his
power to acquire wisdom. His intellect was so great that he understood
everything that he saw or heard. The people regarded him with respect,
and the priests were afraid of his questions. When he was of full age
he went to his parents. They had to listen to some hard language;
and to get rid of him they gave him a quantity of jewels, but they
dared not openly acknowledge him. Overcome with sorrow at the false
shame of his parents, he wandered about. While travelling he fell in
with a Frisian sailor who was serving as a slave, and who taught him
our manners and customs. He bought the freedom of the slave, and they
remained friends till death. Wherever he went he taught the people not
to tolerate rich men or priests, and that they must guard themselves
against false shame, which everywhere did harm to love and charity. The
earth, he said, bestowed her treasures on those who scratch her skin;
so all are obliged to dig, and plough, and sow if they wish to reap,
but no one is obliged to do anything for another unless it be out of
goodwill. He taught that men should not seek in her bowels for gold,
or silver, or precious stones, which occasion envy and destroy love. To
embellish your wives and daughters, he said, the river offers her pure
stream. No man is able to make everybody equally rich and happy, but
it is the duty of all men to make each other as equally rich and as
happy as possible. Men should not despise any knowledge; but justice
is the greatest knowledge that time can teach, because she wards off
offences and promotes love.

His first name was Jessos, but the priests, who hated him, called him
Fo, that is, false; the people called him Krishna, that is, shepherd;
and his Frisian friend called him Buddha (purse), because he had in
his head a treasure of wisdom, and in his heart a treasure of love.

At last he was obliged to flee from the wrath of the priests; but
wherever he went his teaching had preceded him, whilst his enemies
followed him like his shadow. When Jessos had thus travelled for
twelve years he died; but his friends preserved his teaching, and
spread it wherever they found listeners.

What do you think the priests did then? That I must tell you, and
you must give your best attention to it. Moreover, you must keep
guard against their acts and their tricks with all the strength
that Wr-alda has given you. While the doctrine of Jessos was thus
spreading over the earth, the false priests went to the land of
his birth to make his death known. They said they were his friends,
and they pretended to show great sorrow by tearing their clothes and
shaving their heads. They went to live in caves in the mountains, but
in them they had hid all their treasures, and they made in them images
of Jessos. They gave these statues to simple people, and at last they
said that Jessos was a god, that he had declared this himself to them,
and that all those who followed his doctrine should enter his kingdom
hereafter, where all was joy and happiness. Because they knew that
he was opposed to the rich, they announced everywhere that poverty,
suffering, and humility were the door by which to enter into his
kingdom, and that those who had suffered the most on earth should enjoy
the greatest happiness there. Although they knew that Jessos had taught
that men should regulate and control their passions, they taught that
men should stifle their passions, and that the perfection of humanity
consisted in being as unfeeling as the cold stones. In order to make
the people believe that they did as they preached, they pretended to
outward poverty; and that they had overcome all sensual feelings,
they took no wives. But if any young girl had made a false step,
it was quickly forgiven; the weak, they said, were to be assisted,
and to save their souls men must give largely to the Church. Acting
in this way, they had wives and children without households, and were
rich without working; but the people grew poorer and more miserable
than they had ever been before. This doctrine, which requires the
priests to possess no further knowledge than to speak deceitfully,
and to pretend to be pious while acting unjustly, spreads from east
to west, and will come to our land also.

But when the priests fancy that they have entirely extinguished the
light of Frya and Jessos, then shall all classes of men rise up who
have quietly preserved the truth among themselves, and have hidden
it from the priests. They shall be of princely blood of priests,
Slavonic, and Frya's blood. They will make their light visible,
so that all men shall see the truth; they shall cry woe to the acts
of the princes and the priests. The princes who love the truth and
justice shall separate themselves from the priests; blood shall flow,
but from it the people will gather new strength. Finda's folk shall
contribute their industry to the common good, Linda's folk their
strength, and we our wisdom. Then the false priests shall be swept
away from the earth. Wr-alda's spirit shall be invoked everywhere
and always; the laws that Wr-alda in the beginning instilled into
our consciences shall alone be listened to. There shall be neither
princes, nor masters, nor rulers, except those chosen by the general
voice. Then Frya shall rejoice, and the earth will only bestow her
gifts on those who work. All this shall begin 4000 years after the
submersion of Atland, and 1000 years later there shall exist no longer
either priest or oppression.

Dela, surnamed Hellenia, watch!

Thus runs Frana's last will: All noble Frisians, Heil! In the name of
Wr-alda, of Frya, and of Freedom, I greet you; and pray you if I die
before I have named a successor, then I recommend to you Teuntja, who
is Burgtmaagd in the citadel of Medeasblik; till now she is the best.

This Gosa has left behind her: Hail to all men! I have named no
Eeremoeder, because I know none, and because it is better for you to
have no mother than to have one you cannot trust. One bad time is
passed by, but there is still another coming. Irtha has not given
it birth, and Wr-alda has not decreed it. It comes from the East,
out of the bosom of the priests. It will breed so much mischief that
Irtha will not be able to drink the blood of her slain children. It
will spread darkness over the minds of men like storm-clouds over the
sunlight. Everywhere craft and deception shall contend with freedom and
justice. Freedom and justice shall be overcome, and we with them. But
this success will work out its own loss. Our descendants shall teach
their people and their slaves the meaning of three words; they are
universal love, freedom, and justice. At first they shall shine, then
struggle with darkness, until every man's head and heart has become
bright and clear. Then shall oppression be driven from the earth,
like the thunder-clouds by the storm-wind, and all deceit will cease
to have any more power. Gosa.






THE WRITING OF KONERED.


My forefathers have written this book in succession. I will do this,
the more because there exists no longer in my state any citadel on
which events are inscribed as used to be the case. My name is Konered
(Koenraad). My father's name was Frethorik, my mother's name was
Wiljow. After my father's death I was chosen as his successor. When
I was fifty years old I was chosen for chief Grevetman. My father has
written how the Lindaoorden and Liudgaarden were destroyed. Lindahem is
still lost, the Lindaoorden partially, and the north Lindgaarden are
still concealed by the salt sea. The foaming sea washes the ramparts
of the castle. As my father has mentioned, the people, being deprived
of their harbour, went away and built houses inside the ramparts of
the citadel; therefore that bastion is called Lindwerd. The sea-people
say Linwerd, but that is nonsense. In my youth there was a portion of
land lying outside the rampart all mud and marsh; but Frya's people
were neither tired nor exhausted when they had a good object in
view. By digging ditches, and making dams of the earth that came out
of the ditches, we recovered a good space of land outside the rampart,
which had the form of a hoof three poles eastward, three southwards,
and three westwards. At present we are engaged in ramming piles into
the ground to make a harbour to protect our rampart. When the work
is finished we shall attract mariners. In my youth it looked very
queer, but now there stands a row of houses. Leaks and deficiencies
produced by poverty have been remedied by industry. From this men may
learn that Wr-alda, our universal father, protects all his creatures,
if they preserve their courage and help each other.






NOW I WILL WRITE ABOUT FRISO.


Friso, who was already powerful by his troops, was chosen chief
Grevetman of the districts round Staveren. He laughed at our mode
of defending our land and our sea-fights; therefore he established a
school where the boys might learn to fight in the Greek manner, but
I believe that he did it to attach the young people to himself. I
sent my brother there ten years ago, because I thought, now that
we have not got any mother, it behoves me to be doubly watchful,
in order that he may not become our master.

Gosa has given us no successors. I will not give any opinion about
that; but there are still old suspicious people who think that
she and Friso had an understanding about it. When Gosa died, the
people from all parts wished to choose another mother; but Friso,
who was busy establishing a kingdom for himself, did not desire to
have any advice or messenger from Texland. When the messengers of
the Landsaten came to him, he said that Gosa had been far-seeing and
wiser than all the counts together, and yet she had been unable to
see any light or way out of this affair; therefore she had not had
the courage to choose a successor, and to choose a doubtful one she
thought would be very bad; therefore she wrote in her last will,
It is better to have no mother than to have one on whom you cannot
rely. Friso had seen a great deal. He had been brought up in the wars,
and he had just learned and gathered as much of the tricks and cunning
ways of the Gauls and the princes as he required, to lead the other
counts wherever he wished. See here how he went to work about that.

Friso had taken here another wife, a daughter of Wilfrethe, who in
his lifetime had been chief count of Staveren. By her he had two sons
and two daughters. By his wish Kornelia, his youngest daughter, was
married to my brother. Kornelia is not good Frisian; her name ought
to be written Korn-helia. Weemoed, his eldest daughter, he married
to Kauch. Kauch, who went to school to him, is the son of Wichhirte,
the king of the Geertmen. But Kauch is likewise not good Frisian,
and ought to be Kaap (Koop). So they have learned more bad language
than good manners.

Now I must return to my story.

After the great flood of which my father wrote an account, there came
many Jutlanders and Letlanders out of the Baltic, or bad sea. They
were driven down the Kattegat in their boats by the ice as far as the
coast of Denmark, and there they remained. There was not a creature
to be seen; so they took possession of the land, and named it after
themselves, Jutland. Afterwards many of the Denmarkers returned from
the higher lands, but they settled more to the south; and when the
mariners returned who had not been lost, they all went together to
Zeeland. By this arrangement the Jutlanders retained the land to
which Wr-alda had conducted them. The Zeeland skippers, who were
not satisfied to live upon fish, and who hated the Gauls, took to
robbing the Phoenician ships. In the south-west point of Scandinavia
there lies Lindasburgt, called Lindasnose, built by one Apol, as is
written in the book. All the people who live on the coasts, and in
the neighbouring districts, had remained true Frisians; but by their
desire for vengeance upon the Gauls, and the followers of Kaltona,
they joined the Zeelanders. But that connection did not hold together,
because the Zeelanders had adopted many evil manners and customs
of the wicked Magyars, in opposition to Frya's people. Afterwards,
everybody went stealing on his own account; but when it suited them
they held all together. At last the Zeelanders began to be in want
of good ships. Their shipbuilders had died, and their forests as
well as their land had been washed out to sea. Now there arrived
unexpectedly three ships, which anchored off the ringdyk of our
citadel. By the disruption of our land they had lost themselves,
and had missed Flymond. The merchant who was with them wished to
buy new ships from us, and for that purpose had brought all kinds of
valuables, which they had stolen from the Celtic country and Phoenician
ships. As we had no ships, I gave them active horses and four armed
couriers to Friso; because at Stavere, along the Alberga, the best
ships of war were built of hard oak which never rots. While these
sea rovers remained with us, some of the Jutmen had gone to Texland,
and thence to Friso. The Zeelanders had stolen many of their strongest
boys to row their ships, and many of their finest daughters to have
children by. The great Jutlanders could not prevent it, as they were
not properly armed. When they had related all their misfortunes,
and a good deal of conversation had taken place, Friso asked them
at last if they had no good harbours in their country. Oh, yes, they
answered; a beautiful one, created by Wr-alda. It is like a bottle,
the neck narrow, but in the belly a thousand large boats may lie; but
we have no citadel and no defences to keep out the pirate ships. Then
you should make them, said Friso. That is very good advice, said
the Jutlanders; but we have no workmen and no building materials;
we are all fishermen and trawlers. The others are drowned or fled to
the higher lands. While they were talking in this way, my messengers
arrived at the court with the Zeeland gentlemen. Here you must
observe how Friso understood deceiving everybody, to the satisfaction
of both parties, and to the accomplishment of his own ends. To the
Zeelanders he promised that they should have yearly fifty ships of a
fixed size for a fixed price, fitted with iron chains and crossbows,
and full rigging as is necessary and useful for men-of-war, but that
they should leave in peace the Jutlanders and all the people of Frya's
race. But he wished to do more; he wanted to engage all our sea rovers
to go with him upon his fighting expedition. When the Zeelanders
had gone, he loaded forty old ships with weapons for wall defences,
wood, bricks, carpenters, masons, and smiths, in order to build
citadels. Witto, or Witte, his son, he sent to superintend. I have
never been well informed of what happened; but this much is clear to
me, that on each side of the harbour a strong citadel has been built,
and garrisoned by people brought by Friso out of Saksenmarken. Witto
courted Siuchthirte and married her. Wilhem, her father, was chief
Alderman of the Jutmen--that is, chief Grevetman or Count. Wilhem
died shortly afterwards, and Witto was chosen in his place.






WHAT FRISO DID FURTHER.


Of his first wife he still had two brothers-in-law, who were very
daring. Hetto--that is, heat--the youngest, he sent as messenger to
Kattaburgt, which lies far in the Saxsenmarken. Friso gave him to take
seven horses, besides his own, laden with precious things stolen by
the sea-rovers. With each horse there were two young sea-rovers and
two young horsemen, clad in rich garments, and with money in their
purses. In the same way as he sent Hetto to Kattaburgt, he sent
Bruno--that is, brown--the other brother-in-law, to Mannagarda oord,
Mannagarda oord was written Mannagarda ford in the earlier part of
this book, but that is wrong. All the riches that they took with them
were given away, according to circumstances, to princes, princesses,
and chosen young girls. When his young men went to the tavern to
dance with the young people there, they ordered baskets of spice,
gingerbread, and tuns of the best beer. After these messengers he let
his young people constantly go over to the Saxsenmarken, always with
money in their purses and presents to give away, and they spent money
carelessly in the taverns. When the Saxsen youths looked with envy
at this they smiled, and said, If you dare go and fight the common
enemy you would be able to give much richer presents to your brides,
and live much more princely. Both the brothers-in-law of Friso had
married daughters of the chief princes, and afterwards the Saxsen
youths and girls came in whole troops to the Flymeer.

The burgtmaidens and old maidens who still remembered their greatness
did not hold with Friso's object, and therefore they said no good
of him; but Friso, more cunning than they, let them chatter, but
the younger maidens he led to his side with golden fingers. They
said everywhere, For a long time we have had no mother, but that
comes from our being fit to take care of ourselves. At present it
suits us best to have a king to win back our lands that we have lost
through the imprudence of our mothers. Further they said, Every child
of Frya has permission to let his voice be heard before the choice
of a prince is decided; but if it comes to that, that you choose
a king, then also we will have our say. From all that we can see,
Wr-alda has appointed Friso for it, for he has brought him here in a
wonderful way. Friso knows the tricks of the Gauls, whose language he
speaks; he can therefore watch against their craftiness. Then there
is something else to keep the eye upon. What count could be chosen
as king without the others being jealous of him? All such nonsense
the young maidens talked; but the old maidens, though few in number,
tapped their advice out of another cask. They said always and to every
one: Friso does like the spiders. At night he spreads his webs in all
directions, and in the day he catches in them all his unsuspecting
friends. Friso says he cannot suffer any priests or foreign princes,
but we say that he cannot suffer anybody but himself; therefore he
will not allow the citadel of Stavia to be rebuilt; therefore he
will not have the mother again. To-day Friso is your counsellor,
to-morrow he will be your king, in order to have full power over
you. Among the people there now existed two parties. The old and the
poor wished to have the mother again, but the young and the warlike
wished for a father and a king. The first called themselves mother's
sons, the others father's sons, but the mother's sons did not count
for much; because there were many ships to build, there was a good
time for all kinds of workmen. Moreover, the sea-rovers brought all
sorts of treasures, with which the maidens were pleased, the girls
were pleased, and their relations and friends.

When Friso had been nearly forty years at Staveren he died. Owing to
him many of the states had been joined together again, but that we
were the better for it I am not prepared to certify. Of all the counts
that preceded him there was none so renowned as Friso; for, as I said
before, the young maidens spoke in his praise, while the old maidens
did all in their power to make him hateful to everybody. Although the
old women could not prevent his meddling, they made so much fuss that
he died without becoming king.






NOW I WILL WRITE ABOUT HIS SON ADEL.


Friso, who had learned our history from the book of the Adelingen,
had done everything in his power to win their friendship. His eldest
son, whom he had by his wife Swethirte, he named Adel; and although
he strove with all his might to prevent the building or restoring
any citadels, he sent Adel to the citadel of Texland in order to make
himself better acquainted with our laws, language, and customs. When
Adel was twenty years old Friso brought him into his own school,
and when he had fully educated him he sent him to travel through
all the states. Adel was an amiable young man, and in his travels
he made many friends, so the people called him Atharik--that is,
rich in friends--which was very useful to him afterwards, for when
his father died he took his place without a question of any other
count being chosen.

While Adel was studying at Texland there was a lovely maiden at the
citadel. She came from Saxenmarken, from the state of Suobaland,
therefore she was called at Texland Suobene, although her name was
Ifkja. Adel fell in love with her, and she with him, but his father
wished him to wait a little. Adel did as he wished; but as soon as
he was dead, sent messengers to Berthold, her father, to ask her in
marriage. Berthold was a prince of high-principled feelings. He had
sent his daughter to Texland in the hope that she might be chosen
Burgtmaagd in her country, but when he knew of their mutual affection
he bestowed his blessing upon them. Ifkja was a clever Frisian. As
far as I have been able to learn, she always toiled and worked to
bring the Frya's people back under the same laws and customs. To
bring the people to her side, she travelled with her husband through
all Saxenmarken, and also to Geertmannia--as the Geertmen had named
the country which they had obtained by means of Gosa. Thence they
went to Denmark, and from Denmark by sea to Texland. From Texland
they went to Westflyland, and so along the coast to Walhallagara;
thence they followed the Zuiderryn (the Waal), till, with great
apprehension, they arrived beyond the Rhine at the Marsaten of whom
our Apollonia has written. When they had stayed there a little time,
they returned to the lowlands. When they had been some time descending
towards the lowlands, and had reached about the old citadel of Aken,
four of their servants were suddenly murdered and stripped. They had
loitered a little behind. My brother, who was always on the alert,
had forbidden them to do so, but they did not listen to him. The
murderers that had committed this crime were Twisklanders, who had at
that time audaciously crossed the Rhine to murder and to steal. The
Twisklanders are banished and fugitive children of Frya, but their
wives they have stolen from the Tartars. The Tartars are a brown
tribe of Finda's people, who are thus named because they make war on
everybody. They are all horsemen and robbers. This is what makes the
Twisklanders so bloodthirsty. The Twisklanders who had done the wicked
deed called themselves Frijen or Franken. There were among them,
my brother said, red, brown, and white men. The red and brown made
their hair white with lime-water--but as their faces remained brown,
they were only the more ugly. In the same way as Apollonia, they
visited Lydasburgt and the Alderga. Afterwards they made a tour of all
the neighbourhood of Stavera. They behaved with so much amiability,
that everywhere the people wished to keep them. Three months later,
Adel sent messengers to all the friends that he had made, requesting
them to send to him their "wise men" in the month of May.

his wife, he said, who had been maagd of Texland, had received a copy
of it. In Texland many writings are still found which are not copied
in the book of the Adelingen. One of these writings had been placed by
Gosa with her last will, which was to be opened by the oldest maiden,
Albetha, as soon as Friso was dead.






HERE IS THE WRITING WITH GOSA'S ADVICE.


When Wr-alda gave children to the mothers of mankind, he gave one
language to every tongue and to all lips. This gift Wr-alda had
bestowed upon men in order that by its means they might make known
to each other what must be avoided and what must be followed to find
salvation, and to hold salvation to all eternity. Wr-alda is wise
and good, and all-foreseeing. As he knew that happiness and holiness
would flee from the earth when wickedness could overcome virtue,
he has attached to the language an equitable property. This property
consists in this, that men can neither lie nor use deceitful words
without stammering or blushing, by which means the innately bad are
easily known.

As thus our language opens the way to happiness and blessedness,
and thus helps to guard against evil inclinations, it is rightly
named the language of the gods, and all those by whom it is held in
honour derive honour from it. But what has happened? As soon as among
our half brothers and sisters deceivers arose, who gave themselves
out as servants of the good, it soon became otherwise. The deceitful
priests and the malignant princes, who always clung together, wished
to live according to their own inclinations, without regard to the
laws of right. In their wickedness they went so far as to invent other
languages, so that they might speak secretly in anybody's presence
of their wicked and unworthy affairs without betraying themselves by
stammering, and without showing a blush upon their countenances. But
what has that produced? Just as the seed of good herbs which has
been sown by good men in the open day springs up from the ground,
so time brings to light the evil seed which has been sown by wicked
men in secret and in darkness.

The wanton girls and effeminate youths who consorted with the immoral
priests and princes, taught the new language to their companions,
and thus spread it among the people till God's language was clean
forgotten. Would you know what came of all this? how that stammering
and blushing no longer betrayed their evil doings;--virtue passed
away, wisdom and liberty followed; unity was lost, and quarrelling
took its place; love flew away, and unchastity and envy met round
their tables; and where previously justice reigned, now it is the
sword. All are slaves--the subjects of their masters, envy, bad
passions and covetousness. If they had only invented one language
things might possibly have still gone on well; but they invented as
many languages as there are states, so that one people can no more
understand another people than a cow a dog, or a wolf a sheep. The
mariners can bear witness to this. From all this it results that
all the slave people look upon each other as strangers; and that as
a punishment of their inconsiderateness and presumption, they must
quarrel and fight till they are all destroyed.






HERE IS MY COUNSEL.


If you wish that you alone should inherit the earth, you must never
allow any language but God's language to pass your lips, and take care
that your own language remains free from outlandish sounds. If you
wish that some of Lyda's children and some of Finda's children remain,
you must do the same. The language of the East Schoonlanders has been
perverted by the vile Magyars, and the language of the followers
of Kaltana has been spoiled by the dirty Gauls. Now, we have been
weak enough to admit among us the returned followers of Hellenia,
but I anxiously fear that they will reward our weakness by debasing
our pure language.

Many things have happened to us, but among all the citadels that have
been disturbed and destroyed in the bad time, Irtha has preserved
Fryasburgt uninjured; and I may remark that Frya's or God's language
has always remained here untainted.

Here in Texland, therefore, schools should be established; and from all
the states that have kept to the old customs the young people should
be sent here, and afterwards those whose education is complete can
help those who remain at home. If foreigners come to buy ironwares
from you, and want to talk and bargain, they must come back to God's
language. If they learn God's language, then the words, "to be free"
and "to have justice," will come to them, and glimmer and glitter in
their brains to a perfect light, and that flame will destroy all bad
princes and hypocritical dirty priests.

The native and foreign messengers were pleased with that writing, but
no schools came from it. Then Adel established schools himself. Every
year Adel and Ifkja went to inspect the schools. If they found a
friendly feeling existing between the natives and foreigners, they
were extremely pleased. If there were any who had sworn friendship
together, they assembled the people, and with great ceremony let them
inscribe their names in a book which was called the Book of Friendship,
and afterwards a festival was held. All these customs were kept up
in order to bring together the separate branches of Frya's race;
but the maidens who were opposed to Adel and Ifkja said that they
did it for no other reason than to make a name for themselves, and
to bring all the other states under their subjection.

Among my father's papers I found a letter from Liudgert the
Geertman. Omitting some passages which only concern my father,
I proceed to relate the rest.

Punjab, that is five rivers, and by which we travel, is a river of
extraordinary beauty, and is called Five Rivers, because four other
streams flow into the sea by its mouth. Far away to the eastward is
another large river, the Holy or Sacred Ganges. Between these two
rivers is the land of the Hindoos. Both rivers run from the high
mountains to the plains. The mountains in which their sources lie
are so high that they reach the heavens (laia), and therefore these
mountains are called Himmellaia. Among the Hindoos and others out of
these countries there are people who meet together secretly. They
believe that they are pure children of Finda, and that Finda was
born in the Himmellaia mountains, whence she went with her children
to the lowlands. Some of them believe that she, with her children,
floated down upon the foam of the Ganges, and that that is the reason
why the river is called the Sacred Ganges. But the priests, who came
from another country, traced out these people and had them burnt, so
that they do not dare to declare openly their creed. In this country
all the priests are fat and rich. In their churches there are all
kinds of monstrous images, many of them of gold. To the west of the
Punjab are the Yren (Iraniers), or morose (Drangianen), the Gedrosten
(Gedrosiers), or runaways, and the Urgetten, or forgotten. These
names are given by the priests out of spite, because they fled
from their customs and religion. On their arrival our forefathers
likewise established themselves to the east of the Punjab, but on
account of the priests they likewise went to the west. In that way we
learned to know the Yren and other people. The Yren are not savages,
but good people, who neither pray to nor tolerate images; neither
will they suffer priests or churches; but as we adhere to the light
of Fasta, so they everywhere maintain fire in their houses. Coming
still further westward, we arrive at the Gedrosten. Regarding the
Gedrosten: They have been mixed with other people, and speak a variety
of languages. These people are really savage murderers, who always
wander about the country on horseback hunting and robbing, and hire
themselves as soldiers to the surrounding princes, at whose command
they destroy whatever they can reach.

The country between the Punjab and the Ganges is as flat as Friesland
near the sea, and consists of forests and fields, fertile in every
part, but this does not prevent the people from dying by thousands
of hunger. The famines, however, must not be attributed to Wr-alda
or Irtha, but to the princes and priests. The Hindoos are timid and
submissive before their princes, like hinds before wolves. Therefore
the Yren and others have called them Hindoos, which means hinds. But
their timidity is frightfully abused. If strangers come to purchase
corn, everything is turned into money, and this is not prevented by
the priests, because they, being more crafty and rapacious than all
the princes put together, know very well that all the money will come
into their pockets. Besides what the people suffer from their princes,
they suffer a great deal from poisonous and wild beasts. There are
great elephants that sometimes go about in whole flocks and trample
down corn-fields and whole villages. There are great black and white
cats which are called tigers. They are as large as calves, and they
devour both men and beasts. Besides other creeping animals there are
snakes from the size of a worm to the size of a tree. The largest
can swallow a cow, but the smallest are the most deadly. They conceal
themselves among the fruits and flowers, and surprise the people who
come to gather them. Any one who is bitten by them is sure to die,
as Irtha has given no antidote to their poison, because the people
have so given themselves up to idolatry. There are, besides, all
sorts of lizards, tortoises, and crocodiles. All these reptiles,
like the snakes, vary from the size of a worm to the trunk of a
tree. According to their size and fierceness, they have names which I
cannot recollect, but the largest are called alligators, because they
eat as greedily the putrid cattle that float down the stream as they
do living animals that they seize. On the west of the Punjab where we
come from, and where I was born, the same fruits and crops grow as on
the east side. Formerly there existed also the same crawling animals,
but our forefathers burnt all the underwood, and so diligently hunted
all the wild animals, that there are scarcely any left. To the extreme
west of the Punjab there is found rich clay land as well as barren
heaths, which seem endless, occasionally varied lovely spots on which
the eye rests enchanted. Among the fruits there are many that I have
not found here. Among the various kinds of corn some is as yellow
as gold. There are also golden apples, of which some are as sweet as
honey and others as sour as vinegar. In our country there are nuts as
large as a child's head. They contain cheese and milk. When they are
old oil is made from them. Of the husks ropes are made, and of the
shells cups and other household utensils are made. I have found in
the woods here bramble and holly berries. In my country we have trees
bearing berries, as large as your lime-trees, the berries of which
are much sweeter and three times as large as your gooseberries. When
the days are at the longest, and the sun is in the zenith, a man's
body has no shadow. If you sail very far to the south and look to
the east at midday, the sun shines on your left side as it does in
other countries on the right side. With this I will finish. It will
be easy for you, by means of what I have written, to distinguish
between false accounts and true descriptions.--Your Luidgert.






THE WRITING OF BEEDEN.


My name is Beeden, son of Hachgana. My uncle, not having married,
left no children. I was elected in his place. Adel, the third king
of that name, approved of the choice, provided I should acknowledge
him as master. In addition to the entire inheritance of my uncle,
he gave me some land which joined my inheritance, on condition that
I would settle people there who should never his people



therefore I will allow it a place here.






LETTER OF RIKA THE OUDMAAGD, READ AT STAVEREN AT THE JUUL FEAST.


My greeting to all of you whose forefathers came here with
Friso. According to what you say, you are not guilty of idolatry. I
will not speak about that now, but will at once mention a failing which
is very little better. You know, or you do not know, how many titles
Wr-alda has; but you all know that he is named universal provider,
because that everything comes and proceeds from him for the sustenance
of his creatures. It is true that Irtha is named sometimes the feeder
of all, because she brings forth all the fruits and grains on which men
and beasts are fed; but she would not bear any fruit or grain unless
Wr-alda gave her the power. Women who nourish their children at their
breasts are called nurses, but if Wr-alda did not give them milk the
children would find no advantage; so that, in short, Wr-alda really is
the nourisher. That Irtha should be called the universal nourisher,
and that a mother should be called a feeder, one can understand,
figuratively speaking; but that a father should be called a feeder,
because he is a father, goes against all reason. Now I know whence
all this folly comes. Listen to me. It comes from our enemies; and
if this is followed up you will become slaves, to the sorrow of Frya
and to the punishment of your pride, I will tell you what happened to
the slave people; from that you may take warning. The foreign kings,
who follow their own will, place Wr-alda below the crown. From envy
that Wr-alda is called the universal father, they wish also to be
called fathers of the people. Now, everybody knows that kings do
not regulate the productiveness of the earth; and that they have
their sustenance by means of the people, but still they will persist
in their arrogance. In order to attain their object they were not
satisfied from the beginning with free gifts, but imposed a tax upon
the people. With the tax thus raised they hired foreign soldiers, whom
they retained about their courts. Afterwards they took as many wives as
they pleased, and the smaller princes and gentry did the same. When,
in consequence, quarrels and disputes arose in the households, and
complaints were made about it, they said every man is the father
(feeder) of his household, therefore he shall be master and judge
over it. Thus arose arbitrariness, and as the men ruled over their
households the kings would do over their people. When the kings had
accomplished that, they should be called fathers of the people,
they had statues of themselves made, and erected in the churches
beside the statues of the idols, and those who would not bow down
to them were either killed or put in chains. Your forefathers and
the Twisklanders had intercourse with the kings, and learned these
follies from them. But it is not only that some of your men have been
guilty of stealing titles, I have also much to complain of against
your wives. If there are men among you who wish to put themselves
on a level with Wr-alda, there are also women who wish to consider
themselves equals of Frya. Because they have borne children, they call
themselves mothers; but they forget that Frya bore children without
having intercourse with a man. Yes, they not only have desired to rob
Frya and the Eeremoeders of their honourable title (with whom they
cannot put themselves upon an equality), but they do the same with
the honourable titles of their fellow-creatures. There are women who
allow themselves to be called ladies, although they know that that
only belongs to the wives of princes. They also let their daughters be
called maagden, although they know that no young girls are so called
unless they belong to a citadel. You all fancy that you are the better
for this name-stealing, but you forget that jealousy clings to it,
and that every wrong sows the seed of its own rod. If you do not alter
your course, in time it will grow so strong that you cannot see what
will be the end. Your descendants will be flogged by it, and will not
know whence the stripes come. But although you do not build citadels
for the maidens and leave them to their fate, there will still remain
some who will come out of woods and caves, and will prove to your
descendants that you have by your disorderliness been the cause of
it. Then you will be damned. Your ghosts will rise frightened out of
their graves. They will call upon Wr-alda, Frya, and her maidens, but
they shall receive no succour before the Juul shall enter upon a new
circuit, and that will only be three thousand years after this century.


                       THE END OF RIKA'S LETTER.






therefore I will first write about black Adel. Black Adel was the
fourth king after Friso. In his youth he studied first at Texland, and
then at Staveren, and afterwards travelled through all the states. When
he was twenty-four years old his father had him elected Asega-Asker. As
soon as he became Asker he always took the part of the poor. The rich,
he said, do enough of wrong by means of their wealth, therefore we
ought to take care that the poor look up to us. By arguments of this
kind he became the friend of the poor and the terror of the rich. It
was carried so far that his father looked up to him. When his father
died he succeeded, and then he wished to retain his office as well,
as the kings of the East used to do. The rich would not suffer this,
so all the people rose up, and the rich were glad to get out of the
assembly with whole skins. From that time there was no more talk of
equality. He oppressed the rich and flattered the poor, by whose
assistance he succeeded in all his wishes. King Askar, as he was
always called, was seven feet high, and his strength was as remarkable
as his height. He had a clear intellect, so that he understood all
that was talked about, but in his actions he did not display much
wisdom. He had a handsome countenance and a smooth tongue, but his
soul was blacker than his hair. When he had been king for a year,
he obliged all the young men in the state to come once a year to the
camp to have a sham fight. At first he had some trouble with it, but
at last it became such a habit that old and young came from all sides
to ask if they might take part in it. When he had brought it to this
point, he established military schools. The rich complained that their
children no longer learned to read and write. Askar paid no attention
to it; but shortly afterwards, when a sham fight was held, he mounted
a throne and spoke aloud: The rich have come to complain to me that
their boys do not learn to read and write. I answered nothing; but I
will now declare my opinion, and let the general assembly decide. While
they all regarded him with curiosity, he said further: According to my
idea, we ought to leave reading and writing at present to the maagden
and wise people. I do not wish to speak ill of our forefathers; I
will only say that in the times so vaunted by some, the Burgtmaagden
introduced disputes into our country, which the mothers were unable,
either first or last, to put an end to. Worse still, while they talked
and chattered about useless customs the Gauls came and seized all our
beautiful southern country. Even at this very time our degenerate
brothers and their soldiers have already come over the Scheldt. It
therefore remains for us to choose whether we will carry a yoke or
a sword. If we wish to be and to remain free, it behoves our young
men to leave reading and writing alone for a time; and instead of
playing games of swinging and wrestling, they must learn to play with
sword and spear. When we are completely prepared, and the boys are
big enough to carry helmet and shield and to use their weapons, then,
with your help, I will attack the enemy. The Gauls may then record the
defeat of their helpers and soldiers upon our fields with the blood
that flows from their wounds. When we have once expelled the enemy,
then we must follow it up till there are no more Gauls, Slaves,
or Tartars to be driven out of Frya's inheritance. That is right,
the majority shouted, and the rich did not dare to open their mouths.

He must certainly have thought over this address and had it written
out, for on the evening of the same day there were copies in at least
twenty different hands, and they all sounded the same. Afterwards
he ordered the ship people to make double prows, upon which steel
crossbows could be fixed. Those who were backward in doing this
were fined, and if they swore that they had no means, the rich men
of the village were obliged to pay. Now we shall see what resulted
from all this bustle. In the north part of Britain there exists a
Scotch people--the most of them spring from Frya's blood--some of
them are descended from the followers of Keltana, and, for the rest,
from Britons and fugitives who gradually, in the course of time, took
refuge there from the tin mines. Those who come from the tin mines
have wives, either altogether foreign or of foreign descent They are
all under the dominion of the Gauls. Their arms are wooden bows and
arrows pointed with stag's-horn or flint. Their houses are of turf and
straw, and some of them live in caves in the mountains. Sheep that
they have stolen form their only wealth. Some of the descendants of
Keltana's followers still have iron weapons, which they have inherited
from their forefathers. In order to make myself well understood,
I must let alone for a while my account of the Scotch people,
and write something about the near Krekalanders (Italians). The
Krekalanders formerly belonged to us only, but from time immemorial
descendants of Lyda and Finda have established themselves there. Of
these last there came in the end a whole troop from Troy. Troy is
the name of a town that the far Krekalanders (Greeks) had taken and
destroyed. When the Trojans had nestled themselves among the near
Krekalanders, with time and industry they built a strong town with
walls and citadels named Rome, that is, Spacious. When this was done,
the people by craft and force made themselves masters of the whole
land. The people who live on the south side of the Mediterranean Sea,
come for the most part from Phoenicia. The Phoenicians (Puniers or
Carthaginians) are a bastard race of the blood of Frya, Finda, and
Lyda. The Lyda people were there as slaves, but by the unchastity of
the women these black people have degenerated the other people and
dyed them brown. These people and the Romans are constantly struggling
for the supremacy over the Mediterranean Sea. The Romans, moreover,
live at enmity with the Phoenicians; and their priests, who wish to
assume the sole government of the world, cannot bear the sight of the
Gauls. First they took from the Phoenicians Marseilles--then all the
countries lying to the south, the west, and the north, as well as
the southern part of Britain--and they have always driven away the
Phoenician priests, that is the Gauls, of whom thousands have sought
refuge in North Britain. A short time ago the chief of the Gauls was
established in the citadel, which is called Kerenac (Karnac), that
is the corner, whence he issued his commands to the Gauls. All their
gold was likewise collected there. Keeren Herne (chosen corner), or
Kerenac, is a stone citadel which did belong to Kalta. Therefore the
maidens of the descendants of Kaltana's followers wished to have the
citadel again. Thus through the enmity of the maidens and the Gaul's,
hatred and quarrelling spread ever the mountain country with fire and
sword. Our sea people often came there to get wool, which they paid
for with prepared hides and linen. Askar had often gone with them,
and had secretly made friendship with the maidens and some princes,
and bound himself to drive the Gauls out of Kerenac. When he came
back there again he gave to the princes and the fighting men iron
helmets and steel bows. War had come with him, and soon blood was
streaming down the slopes of the mountains. When Askar thought a
favourable opportunity occurred, he vent with forty ships and took
Kerenac and the chief of the Gauls, with all his gold. The people
with whom he fought against the soldiers of the Gauls, he had enticed
out of the Saxenmarken by promises of much booty and plunder. Thus
nothing was left to the Gauls. After that he took two islands for
stations for his ships, from which he used later to sally forth and
plunder all the Phoenician ships and towns that he could reach. When
he returned he brought nearly six hundred of the finest youths of the
Scotch mountaineers with him. He said that they had been given him as
hostages, that he might be sure that the parents would remain faithful
to him; but this was untrue. He kept them as a bodyguard at his court,
where they had daily lessons in riding and in the use of all kinds of
arms. The Denmarkers, who proudly considered themselves sea-warriors
above all the other sea-people, no sooner heard of the glorious
deeds of Askar, than they became jealous of him to such a degree,
that they would bring war over the sea and over his lands. See here,
then, how he was able to avoid a war. Among the ruins of the destroyed
citadel of Stavia there was still established a clever Burgtmaagd,
with a few maidens. Her name was Reintja, and she was famed for
her wisdom. This maid offered her assistance to Askar, on condition
that he should afterwards rebuild the citadel of Stavia. When he had
bound himself to do this, Reintja went with three maidens to Hals
(Holstein). She travelled by night, and by day she made speeches in
all the markets and in all the assemblies. Wr-alda, she said, had told
her by his thunder that all the Frya's people must become friends,
and united as brothers and sisters, otherwise Finda's people would
come and sweep them off the face of the earth. After the thunder
Frya's seven watch-maidens appeared to her in a dream seven nights
in succession. They had said, Disaster hovers over Frya's land with
yoke and chains; therefore all the people who have sprung from Frya's
blood must do away with their surnames, and only call themselves Frya's
children, or Frya's people. They must all rise up and drive Finda's
people out of Frya's inheritance. If you will not do that, you will
bring the slave-chains round your necks, and the foreign chiefs will
ill-treat your children and flog them till the blood streams into your
graves. Then shall the spirits of your forefathers appear to you, and
reproach your cowardice and thoughtlessness. The stupid people who,
by the acts of the Magyars, were already so much accustomed to folly,
believed all that she said, and the mothers clasped their children
to their bosoms. When Reintja had brought the king of Holstein and
the others to an agreement, she sent messengers to Askar, and went
herself along the Baltic Sea. From there she went to the Lithauers
(Face-hewers), so called because they always strike at their enemy's
face. The Lithauers are fugitives and banished people of our own race,
who wander about in the Twisklanden. Their wives have been mostly
stolen from the Tartars. The Tartars are a branch of Finda's race,
and are thus named by the Twisklanders because they never will be
at peace, but provoke people to fight. She proceeded on beyond the
Saxsenmarken, crossing through the other Twisklanders in order always
to repeat the same thing. After two years had passed, she came along
the Rhine home. Among the Twisklanders she gave herself out for a
mother, and said that they might return as free and true people;
but then they must go over the Rhine and drive the Gauls out of
Frya's south lands. If they did that, then her King Askar would go
over the Scheldt and win back the land. Among the Twisklanders many
bad customs of the Tartars and Magyars have crept in, but likewise
many of our laws have remained. Therefore they still have Maagden,
who teach the children and advise the old. In the beginning they were
opposed to Reintja, but at last she was followed, obeyed, and praised
by them where it was useful or necessary.

As soon as Askar heard from Reintja's messengers how the Jutlanders
were disposed, he immediately, on his side, sent messengers to the
King of Hals. The ship in which the messengers went was laden with
women's ornaments, and took also a golden shield on which Askar's
portrait was artistically represented. These messengers were to ask
the King's daughter, Frethogunsta, in marriage for Askar. Frethogunsta
came a year after that to Staveren. Among her followers was a Magy,
for the Jutlanders had been long ago corrupted. Soon after Askar had
married Frethogunsta, a church was built at Staveren. In the church
were placed monstrous images, bedecked with gold-woven dresses. It is
also said that Askar, by night, and at unseasonable times, kneeled
to them with Frethogunsta; but one thing is certain, the citadel of
Stavia was never rebuilt. Reintja was already come back, and went
angrily to Prontlik the mother, at Texland, to complain. Prontlik sent
out messengers in all directions, who proclaimed that Askar is gone
over to Idolatry. Askar took no notice of this, but unexpectedly a
fleet arrived from Hals. In the night the maidens were driven out
of the citadel, and in the morning there was nothing to be seen
of the citadel but a glowing heap of rubbish. Prontlik and Reintja
came to me for shelter. When I reflected upon it, I thought that it
might prove bad for my state. Therefore, we hit upon a plan which
might serve us all. This is the way we went to work. In the middle
of the Krijlwood, to the east of Liudwerd, lies our place of refuge,
which can only be reached by a concealed path. A long time ago I had
established a garrison of young men who all hated Askar, and kept away
all other people. Now it was come to such a pitch among us, that many
women, and even men, talked about ghosts, white women, and gnomes,
just like the Denmarkers. Askar had made use of all these follies
for his own advantage, and we wished to do the same. One dark night
I brought the Maagden to the citadel, and afterwards they went with
their serving-maids dressed in white along the path, so that nobody
dare go there any more. When Askar thought he had his hands free, he
let the Magyars travel through his states under all kinds of names,
and, except in my state, they were not turned away anywhere. After
that Askar had become so connected with the Jutlanders and the
Denmarkers, they all went roving together; but it produced no real
good to them. They brought all sorts of foreign treasures home, and
just for that reason the young men would learn no trades, nor work
in the fields; so at last he was obliged to take slaves; but that was
altogether contrary to Wr-alda's wish and to Frya's counsel. Therefore
the punishment was sure to follow it. This is the way in which the
punishment came. They had all together taken a whole fleet that came
out of the Mediterranean Sea. This fleet was laden with purple cloths
and other valuables that came from Phoenicia. The weak people of
the fleet were put ashore south of the Seine, but the strong people
were kept to serve as slaves. The handsomest were retained ashore,
and the ugly and black were kept on board ship as rowers. In the
Fly the plunder was divided, but, without their knowing it, they
divided the punishment too. Of those who were placed in the foreign
ships six died of colic. It was thought that the food and drink were
poisoned, so it was all thrown overboard, but the colic remained all
the same. Wherever the slaves or the goods came, there it came too. The
Saxsenmen took it over to their marches. The Jutlanders brought it to
Schoonland and along the coasts of the Baltic Sea, and with Askar's
mariners it was taken to Britain. We and the people of Grenega did not
allow either the people or the goods to come over our boundaries, and
therefore we remained free from it. How many people were carried off
by this disease I cannot tell; but Prontlik, who heard it afterwards
from the maidens, told me that Askar had helped out of his states a
thousand times more free-men than he had brought dirty slaves in. When
the pest had ceased, the Twisklanders who had become free came to
the Rhine, but Askar would not put himself on an equality with the
princes of that vile degenerate race. He would not suffer them to
call themselves Frya's children, as Reintja had offered them, but he
forgot then that he himself had black hair. Among the Twisklanders
there were two tribes who did not call themselves Twisklanders. One
came from the far south-east, and called themselves Allemannen. They
had given themselves this name when they had no women among them,
and were wandering as exiles in the forests. Later on they stole
women from the slave people like the Lithauers, but they kept their
name. The other tribe, that wandered about in the neighbourhood,
called themselves Franks, not because they were free, but the name
of their first king was Frank, who, by the help of the degenerate
maidens, had had himself made hereditary king over his people. The
people nearest to him called themselves Thioth--his sons--that is,
sons of the people. They had remained free, because they never would
acknowledge any king, or prince, or master except those chosen by
general consent in a general assembly. Askar had already learned from
Reintja that the Twisklander princes were almost always at war with
each other. He proposed to them that they should choose a duke from
his people, because, as he said, he was afraid that they would quarrel
among themselves for the supremacy. He said also that his princes
could speak with the Gauls. This, he said, was also the opinion of the
mother. Then the princes of the Twisklanders came together, and after
twenty-one days they chose Alrik as duke. Alrik was Askar's nephew. He
gave him two hundred Scotch and one hundred of the greatest Saksmannen
to go with him as a bodyguard, The princes were to send twenty-one
of their sons as hostages for their fidelity. Thus far all had gone
according to his wishes; but when they were to go over the Rhine, the
king of the Franks would not be under Alrik's command. Thereupon all
was confusion. Askar, who thought that all was going on well, landed
with his ships on the other side of the Scheldt; but there they were
already aware of his coming, and were on their guard. He had to flee
as quickly as he had come, and was himself taken prisoner. The Gauls
did not know whom they had taken, so he was afterwards exchanged for
a noble Gaul whom Askar's people had taken with them. While all this
was going on, the Magyars went about audaciously over the lands of
our neighbours. Near Egmuda, where formerly the citadel Forana had
stood, they built a church larger and richer than that which Askar
had built at Staveren. They said afterwards that Askar had lost the
battle against the Gauls, because the people did not believe that
Wodin could help them, and therefore they would not pray to him. They
went about stealing young children, whom they kept and brought up in
the mysteries of their abominable doctrines. Were there people who

That was Frya his dei and to there stonde was et vrleden sjvgun wara

That is vsa forma skednise.

Wr.alda [10] tham allena god and evg is, makade t.anfang, dana kem
tid, tid wrochte alle thinga ak jrtha. Jrtha barde alle garsa, krudon

nachtis forth. Afteret twilifte jol-ferste barde hja thrja mangerta.

Lyda warth ut glyande,

Finda warth ut heta and

Frya ut warme stof.

Tha hja blat kemon spisde Wr.alda hjam mith sina adama; til thju tha

Lyda was swart, krolhered alsa tha lomera: lik stara blonken hjra ogon;
ja thes gyrfuegels blikkar weron vnmodich by hjras.

Skarpe Lyda. Annen sanaka kvn hju kruppa hera, and hwersa ther fiska

Radbvwde Lyda. En store bam kvn hju bugja and sahwersa hja run ne

Weldige Lyda. Hard was hjra steme and kret hju ut grimme sa run ek

Wonderfvlle Lyda. Fon ewa nilde hju navt neta: hjra deda wrdon thrvch

Vrledalike Finda. Svet was hjra stemme and nannen fuegel kvn sjonga

Vnredalika Finda. Hju skref thusande ewa, tha hju ne folgde nen er

That was hir vnluk. Hjra haved was to fvl: tha hjr hirte to ydel;

Falske Finda. Huening swet weron hjra wirda, tha hok tham hja trjvwade

Selvsjochta Finda. Ovir ella wilde hju welda, and hjra svnum weron

Dubbelhirta Finda. Vmbe skotse wirda warth hju yre, and tha argste

Vnluke Finda. Hju sturf anda blomtid fon hjra leva, and-t is jeta

Skinheliga barn. Vnder kestlike stena leidon hja hjra lik del, mit
kwabbjana skriftum smukton hja tham vppa, tograjande vmbe herath to

Skene Frya. Lik strelon there middei svnne blikadon hjra heron,

Weldige Frya. Thrvch thene kraft hjrar blikkar strek thene lawa to

Rene Frya. Hjra yta was huening and hjra drank was dawa, gadvrad anda
bosma thera blommur.

Lichte Frya. That forma hwat hju hjra barn lerde was selv-twang, that
othera was lyafte to dueged, and tha hja jeroch wrdon, tha lerde hju

Milde Frya. Nammer lyt hju metal ut jrtha dalva vmb ajnbat, men

Lukigoste Frya. Alsa tha stara om jrtha omswyrmia swirmadon hjara

Utforkerena Frya. Tha hju-t seid hede, bevade jrtha lik Wr.aldas se,

10 jer after Jon wei brit was, kemon hyr thrju skepa in-t Flymar falla,

alderlangne nei hjara bigrip were, alsa hede hja Tuenis to en gode up
hejad, to argnisse sinra folgar. As hja nv Thyr after bek were, kemon,
tha Thyriar en skip uta afte hoda rawa, neidam that skip to fer was,
kvndon wi-t navt wither wina, men Jon swor wreka thervr. Tha nacht

Bitwiska tha ferum and heinda Krekalandum fand Jon svma elanda ther

Tha Minerva that land bisjan hede, that thrvch tha inhemar Attika is

That forma gvngon hja vppa run, tha as hja sagon that wi navt ne

That nv willath tha forsta navt, hja willath vs wei driwa. Men tha

Thit is thju skednesse fon Jon and Minerva.

By vs vppa burch ist alsa delad. Sjugun jonge famna wakath by there

To tha lersta kemon wi to-t Alderga. By-t suderhavahaved stet thju
Waraburch, en stenhus, therin send allerleja skulpa, hulka, wepne and

Friso ther al weldich were thrvch sin ljud, warth ak to vrste

Gosa neth vs nene folgstere nometh, ther vr nil ik nen ordel ne fella,
men ther send jeta alda arg thenkande manniska, ther mene that hju-t

that is jow betre nene Moder to havande as ene hwer vpp-i jo selva

Nw mot ik mith mine skednese a-befta kera.

Aftre grate flod hwer vr min tat skreven heth, weron felo Juttar

HO FRISO FORTHER DEDE.


Fon sin erosta wif heder twen sviaringa bihalda, ther ser klok

nei Kattaburch that djap inna Saxanamarka leid. Hi hede fon Friso
mith krejen sjugon horsa buta sin ajn, to leden mith kestlika sekum,
thrvch tha sekampar rawed. Bi jahweder hors weron twen jonga sekampar
and twen jonga hrutar mith rika kladarum klath and jeld in hiara
budar. Evin as er Hetto nei Kattaburch skikte, skikter Bruno, that
is brune, thene othera svjaring nei Mannagarda wrda, Mannagarda
wrda is far in thit bok [88] Mannagarda forda skreven, men that is
misden. Alle rikdoma ther hja mith hede wrdon nei omstand wei skankt
an tha forsta and forstene and an tha utforkerne mangertne. Kemon tha
sine knapa vppa there meid vmbe ther mith et jongkfolk to donsjane,
sa leton hja kvra mith krudkok kvma and bargum jeftha tonnum fon
tha besta bjar. After thissa bodon let-er immer jongkfolk over tha
Saxanarmarka fara, ther alle jeld inna budar hede and alle meida
jeftha skankadja mith brochton, and vppa there meid teradon hja alon
vnkvmmerlik wei. Jef-t nv berde that tha Saxana knapa ther nydich nei
utsagon, than lakton hja godlik and seidon, aste thvrath thene mena

knapa and mangertne by elle keddum nei that Flymar del.

Tha burchfamna and tha alda famna ther jeta fon hjar ere grathed wiste,
nygadon navt vr nei Frisos bedriv, thervmbe ne kethon hja nen god fon

frydom jeven, sin stem hera to letane bi fara ther bisloten warth bi
t kjasa enre forste, men ast alsa wyd kvma machte that i jo wither ne
kaning kjasa, sa wil ik ak min mene segse. Nei al hwat ik skoja mei,
sa is Friso ther to thrvch Wr.alda keren, hwand hi heth im wonderlik
hir hinne weiad. Friso wet tha hrenka thera Golum, hwam his tale hi
sprekt, hi kan thus ajen hjara lestum waka. Than is ther jeta awet to
skojande, hok Greva skolde man to kaning kjasa svnder that tha ora
ther nidich vr weron. Aldulkera talum warth thrvch tha jonga famnn
kethen, men tha alde famma afsken fe an tal, tapadon hjara redne ut en
othera barg. Hja kethon allerweikes and to alla mannalik: Friso kethon
hja dvath sa tha spinna dvan, thes nachtis sponth-i netta nei alle
sidum and thes deis vrskalkth-i ther sina vnaftertochtlika frjunda
in. Friso seith that-er nene prestera ner poppa forsta lyde ne mei,
men ik seg, hi ne mei nimman lyda as him selva. Thervmbe nil hi navt
ne daja that thju burch Stavia wither vp hejath warth. Thervmbe wil
hi nene Moder wer ha. Jud is Friso jow red jevar, men morne wil hi
jow kaning wertha, til thju hi over jo alle rjuchta mei. Inna bosm
thes folk-is antstondon nw twa partyja. Tha alda and arma wildon
wither ene Moder ha, men that jongkfolk, that fvl stredlust were
wilde ne tat jeftha kaning ha. Tha erosta heton hjara selva moder
his svna and tha othera heton hjara selva tat his svna, men tha Moder
his svna ne wrde wrde navt ni meld, hwand thrvchdam ther felo skepa
maked wrde, was ther ovirflod to fara skipmakar, smeda, sylmakar,
repmakar and to fara alle ora ambachtisljud. Ther to boppa brochton
tha sekampar allerleja syrheda mith. Ther fon hedon tha wiva nocht,
tha famna nocht, tha mangertne nocht, and therof hedon al hjara megum
nocht and al hjara frjundum and athum.

Tha Friso bi fjuwertich jer et Staveren hushalden hede sturf-er. [89]
Thrvch sin bijelda hede-r felo stata wither to manlik otherum brocht,
thach jef wi ther thrvch beter wrde thvr ik navt bijechta. Fon
alle Greva ther bifara him weron n-as ther nimman sa bifamed lik
Friso west. Tha sa as-k er seide, tha jonge famna kethon sina love,
thahwila tha alda famna ella dedon vmb-im to achtjane and hatlik to

NW WIL IK SKRIWA VR ADEL SIN SVNV.


Friso ther vsa skidnese lered hede ut-et bok thera Adellinga, hede

Thahwila Adel to Texland inna lere were, was ther tefta en elle

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
