Confessions _of a_ Caricaturist


William Dean Howells

    Not squirrels in the park alone
    His love and winter-kindness own.
    When Literary Fledglings try
    Their wings, in first attempt to fly,
    They flutter down to Franklin Square,
    Where Howells in his "Easy Chair"
    Like good Saint Francis scatters crumbs
    Of Hope, to each small bird that comes.
    And since Bread, cast upon the main,
    Must to the giver come again,
    I tender now, long overtime,
    This humble Crumb of grateful rhyme.

        (See Frontispiece)


Napoleon

    I like to draw Napoleon best
    Because one hand is in his vest,
    The other hand behind his back.
    (For drawing hands I have no knack.)

[Illustration]


Dante

    If you should ask me, whether Dante
    Drank Benedictine or Chianti,
    I should reply, "I cannot say,
    But I can draw him either way."

[Illustration]


Theodore Roosevelt

    The ways of Providence are odd.
    If THEODORE means "The Gift of God,"
    Let us give thanks, at any rate,
    The Gift was not a duplicate.


    _Aside_ (To T. R)

    Dear Theodore, should it give you pain
    To read this Rhyme, let me explain.
    If we 'exchanged' you, where on Earth
    Could we find one of Equal worth?

    O. H.

[Illustration]


Rudyard Kipling

    I seem to see a Shining One,
    With eyes that gleam, now fierce, now tender,
    Through Goggles that reflect the Sun
    "With more than Oriental Splendor";
    I see him sitting on a chest
    Heavy with padlocks, bolts, and cording,
    Where Untold Treasures hidden rest,
    Treasures of Untold Yarns he's hoarding.
    Oh, Rudyard, please unlock that chest!
    With hope deferred we're growing hoary;
    Or was it all an empty jest
    Your saying, "_That's another story_"?

[Illustration]


Ignace Jan Paderewski

    When Paderewski is forgot,
    Our children's children, like as not,
    Will worship in the Hall of Fame,
    Some great piano-maker's name.

[Illustration]


Daniel Frohman

    I love to picture Daniel Frohman
    In costume of a noble Roman.
    For Dan has just the style of hair,
    That Julius Caesar used to wear.

[Illustration]


Charles W. Eliot

    And now comes Dr. Eliot stating
    That Hell won't bear investigating.
    It looks like Charlie's out to bust
    The Great Hell-Fire Insurance Trust.

[Illustration]


J. Pierpont Morgan

      In Rome, when Morgan came to town,
      They nailed the Colosseum down.
      A great Collector! Once his Fad
      Was Coins, but when in time he had
      Collected all the coin in sight,
      To Europe's Art his thoughts took flight.
      But let not Europe palpitate
    For fear of an Art Syndicate.
      There are more Rembrandts, strange to say,
      Than ever were in Rembrandt's day;
      And statues "planted" in the sand
      Will always equal the demand.

[Illustration]


Gilbert K. Chesterton

    Unless I'm very much misled,
    Chesterton's easier done than said.
    I have not seen him, but his looks
    I can imagine from his books.

[Illustration]


Guglielmo Marconi

    I like Marconi best to see
    Beneath a Macaroni tree
    Playing that Nocturne in F Sharp
    By Chopin, on a Wireless Harp.

[Illustration]


George Bernard Shaw

    The very name of Bernard Shaw
    Fills me with mingled Mirth and Awe.
    Mixture of Mephistopheles,
    Don Quixote, and Diogenes,
    The Devil's wit, the Don's Romance
    Joined to the Cynic's arrogance.
    Framed on Pythagorean plan,
    A Vegetable Souperman.
    Here you may see him crown with bay
    The Greatest Playwright of his day;[1]
    Observe the look of Self Distrust
    And Diffidence--upon the bust.

    [1] For "his" read any.--G. B. S.

[Illustration]


Brander Matthews

    I'd best beware how I make free
    With Brander Matthews L. L. D.
    Since Prexy Wilson's paved the way
    He may be President some day.

[Illustration]


John S. Sargent

    Here's Sargent doing the Duchess X
    In pink velours and pea-green checks.
    "It helps," says he, "to lift your Grace
    A bit above the commonplace."

[Illustration]


Arnold Bennett

    'Tis very comforting to know
    That every other day or so
    A Book by Bennett will appear
    To charm the Western Hemisphere.
    I see him now, with zeal sublime,
    Pounding from dawn to dinner-time
    Four typewriters, with hands and feet.
    When the four novels are complete,
    He'll fold, and send _a grande vitesse_
    His Quadrumanuscript to press.


    P. S.

    Just think how much we'd have to read
    If Bennett were a centipede

    O. H.

[Illustration]


Shakespeare

    Will Shakespeare, the Baconians say,
    Was the Belasco of his day--
    Others more plausibly maintain
    He was the double of Hall Caine.

[Illustration]


William Howard Taft

    I'm sorry William Taft is out
    Of Politics; without a doubt
    Of all the Presidential crew
    He was the easiest to do.

[Illustration]


G. K. Chesterton

    When Plain Folk, such as you or I,
    See the Sun sinking in the sky,
    We think it is the Setting Sun,
    But Mr. Gilbert Chesterton
    Is not so easily misled.
    He calmly stands upon his head,
    And upside down obtains a new
    And Chestertonian point of view,
    Observing thus, how from his toes
    The sun creeps nearer to his nose,
    He cries with wonder and delight,
    "How Grand the SUNRISE is to-night!"

[Illustration]


David Belasco

    Behold Belasco in his den,
    Wielding the scissors, paste and pen,
    And writing with consummate skill
    A play by W. De Mille.

[Illustration]


Henrik Ibsen

    I once drew Ibsen, looking bored
    Across a deep Norwegian Fjord,
    And very nearly every one
    Mistook him for the midnight sun.

[Illustration]


J. Forbes-Robertson

    I'm told the Artist who aspires
    To draw Forbes-Robertson requires
    A Sargent's brush. Dear me! how sad!
    I've lost the only one I had.

[Illustration]


John Drew

    For Perfect Form there are but few
    That can compare with Mr. Drew;
    A Form most fittingly displayed
    In roles from London, tailor-made
    By Messrs. Maughn, Pinero, Jones,
    In quiet, gentlemanly tones.
    The _Nouveaux-Riches_ flock, day by day,
    To learn from John how to display
    (Without unnecessary gloom)
    The manners of the drawing-room.
    This possibly may be the cause
    (Or one of them) why John Drew draws.

[Illustration]


Israel Zangwill

    This picture though it is not much
      Like Zangwill, is not void of worth
    It has one true Zangwillian touch
      It looks like nothing else on earth.

[Illustration]


George Bernard Shaw

    George Bernard Shaw--Oh, yes, I know
    I did him not so long ago.
    But then, you see, I _like_ to do
    George Bernard Shaw (George likes it too).

[Illustration]


Peter Dunne

_By the Harp_

    "Shpeaking of Harps, sure me frind Pete
     Has got the Harp of Tara beat,"
     Said Mr. Dooley. "Div'l a thing
     That boy can't play upon won shtring.
     For all the wurrld, to hear him play
     You'd think 'twas a whole orchestray.
     Great Shtatesmen come from far and near
     And shtop their talking, just to hear
     Him harp upon the latest kinks
     In politics and social jinks.
     Niver was such a music sharp,
     I'd orter know, sure _I'm_ the Harp."

[Illustration]


Saint Paul

    It saddens me to think Saint Paul
    Such lengthy letters had to scrawl.
    And so to make his labor lighter
    I picture him with a typewriter.

[Illustration]


John D. Rockefeller

    Few faces interest me less
    Than Rockefeller's, I confess.
    'Twould vastly better suit my whim
    To draw his bank account, than him.

[Illustration]


Hiram Maxim

    From Hiram Maxim's hair you'd think
    His specialty was spilling ink--
    You'd never dream he'd spilt more blood
    Than any one man since the Flood.

[Illustration]


George Ade

    Somehow I always like to think
    Of GEORGEADE as a Summer Drink,
    Sparkling and cool, with just a Tang
    Of Pleasant Effervescent Slang;
    A Wholesome Tonic, without question,
    And Cure for Moral Indigestion.
    In Summer-time, beneath the shade,
    We find Refreshment in GEORGEADE.
    And 'mid the Scorching City's roar
    We drink him up and call for more.
    I often wonder what the "Trade"
    Buys half so precious as GEORGEADE.

[Illustration]


Christopher Columbus

    Columbus is an easy one
    To draw, for when the picture's done,
    Where is the captious critic who
    Can say the likeness is not true?

[Illustration]


F. W. Hohenzollern

    In things like this I've always tried
    To look upon the Brighter Side;
    And when I see the Prince, I say
    "The Crown's worth _something_ anyway."

[Illustration]


[Illustration: _Picture of O. H. and Hafiz, the "Persian Kitten," by
James Montgomery Flagg._]


[Illustration]

Hafiz

    When Hafiz saw the portrait free,
    By Monty Flagg, of him and me,
    He made remarks one can't repeat
    In any reputable sheet.

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
