  GIRLS OF THE TRUE BLUE: A School Story. By L. T. MEADE. With ten
  Illustrations by Percy Tarrant.                                  6/

      Girls of all ages are sure to be fascinated by the pathetic and
      highly interesting narrative of Nan Esterleigh, the orphan girl
      who makes her home with a friend of her mother's, where she has
      abundance of nice pets, good companions, and an atmosphere of
      wholesome comfort, and where she is quite happy until an act of
      deceit puts her in the power of an older and designing girl, and
      renders her at times very miserable. This wrong-doing is the
      shadow over her life, as she finds when Captain Richmond starts
      the Royal True Blue society, with its prize to be given for the
      best girl who had cultivated every side of her nature--moral,
      intellectual, and physical. She is seriously handicapped, and
      the prize falls, through an error, to the designing girl who has
      ruined her happiness. Misfortune brings this maiden to a better
      mind and true repentance, and Nan comes to her own again in the
      esteem and respect of every one. There are many other attractive
      girl characters in this entertaining story.

  A NEST OF GIRLS; or, Boarding School Days. By E. WESTYN TIMLOW. With
  eight Illustrations by H. R. Richards.                           6/

      Here we are introduced to a bevy of smart, clever, American
      girls in a boarding-school, just at the time that Winifred
      Douglas becomes teacher of English Literature there. Winifred
      was wise, if only four-and-twenty, and the love she felt for her
      work was only equalled by the sense of responsibility she had
      for the impressionable girls under her charge. How she helped
      and influenced them for good, although she 'hurt sometimes,'
      comes out in the story, which is brimful of life and vivacity.
      The lady principal and the doings of a circle of immensely smart
      girls keep up the interest of this wholesome picture of
      girl-life.

  A VERY NAUGHTY GIRL. By L. T. MEADE. With eight Illustrations by W.
  Rainey.                                                          5/

      All spirited maidens will follow with interest the training and
      development of the character of Evelyn Wynford, heiress of
      Castle Wynford, who, when she arrives from Tasmania at her
      uncle's house, which will afterwards be her own, is extremely
      self-conscious though clever, and is wilful, selfish, vain, and
      altogether unladylike. Her maid Jasper is her evil genius. As
      the story develops, her aunt, her cousin, and others begin to
      have a wholesome influence over her; then certain misdemeanours,
      which land her in serious trouble, humble her, and leave her
      much changed and truly repentant. The 'Naughty Girl' becomes
      transformed into a wise and comely young woman.

  COURAGE AND CONFLICT. A Series of Stories by G. A. HENTY, G.
  MANVILLE FENN, F. T. BULLEN, FRED WHISHAW, &c. With eight
  Illustrations by W. Boucher.                                     5/

      The names of the writers here are a guarantee for the sound
      entertainment provided in this companion volume to _Dash and
      Daring_, _Peril and Prowess_, and _Venture and Valour_. The
      story by Mr G. A. Henty is one of pioneering in the days of the
      early settlers in America, when the natives were troublesome,
      and who in this case rose up and nearly exterminated the white
      people. Mr G. M. Fenn tells a funny seaside story; while Andrew
      Balfour, Captain North, Walter Thornbury, James Patey, Fred
      Whishaw, Harold Bindloss, and others contribute dashing stories
      of peril and adventure, and great heroism in the hour of danger.

  THE KOPJE GARRISON: A Tale of the Boer War. By G. MANVILLE FENN.
  With eight Illustrations by W. Boucher.                          5/

      Mr Fenn transports his readers to the South African veldt,
      where, in imagination and in reality, so many of his countrymen
      have been for the past two years, and helps them to understand
      by means of this brisk and exciting tale what so many of our
      gallant soldiers have had to endure. This new story mainly
      follows the fortunes of two young men in khaki--Drew Lennox and
      Bob Dickenson--in and around the village of Groenfontein, which
      is bravely held by a little British force against the Boers.
      Sometimes half-starved, and subjected to night and day attacks,
      they make a little Gibraltar of the place, and ever render a
      good account of themselves. Something is always happening within
      or without Groenfontein, and in the end the story leaves Drew
      Lennox captain and V.C.

      _Punch_ says--'My Baronitess informs me that she has not the
      slightest hesitation in advising everybody young enough to enjoy
      the story to make the acquaintance of _Miss Nonentity_, by L. T.

  A POPULAR GIRL: A Tale of School Life in Germany. With six
  Illustrations by Jessie Wilson. By MAY BALDWIN.                 3/6

      A bright and naturally told story of school-girl life in
      Germany, in which the contrasts with school life in this country
      are strongly brought out. The heroine, a good-looking, clever
      English girl, in a high-class school in Munich, meets with a
      smart American girl who sins against many of the written and
      unwritten laws of etiquette by her pranks and the freedom of
      her manners and speech; yet all the while she is exceedingly
      liberal, good-hearted, and well-intentioned, and a good friend
      of the heroine, whom she shields from blame in connection with
      an act which led to disastrous consequences. The lady principal,
      Fraeulein Luise, one of the best of women, cautions the heroine
      about her over-anxiety to be the best girl scholar; in spite of
      this she works openly and secretly for this end, which is gained
      at the expense, for a time, of her health and memory. It is
      while the heroine is at death's door that she learns a lifelong
      lesson that goodness is by far of more importance than
      cleverness.

  COSEY CORNER; or, How they Kept a Farm. By L. T. MEADE. With eighteen
  Illustrations by Percy Tarrant.                                 3/6

      Mrs L. T. Meade, in her best vein, here tells how four children
      show great ingenuity and cleverness in playing at keeping a
      farm, and manage to support themselves for a time from the
      proceeds. It is a wholesome lesson in self-help, and the reader
      will be inclined to agree with one of the children that 'there
      never was anything so nice in all the world as was life at Cosey
      Corner.' Honeysuckle Farm, the farmer and his wife, and the life
      there are prettily described, and the story is further helped by
      the eighteen charming illustrations by Mr Percy Tarrant.

  'MY PRETTY' AND HER BROTHER 'TOO.' And other Stories. By Mrs
  MOLESWORTH. Charmingly Illustrated by Lewis Baumer.             3/6

      Mrs Molesworth, always happily inspired when she writes for or
      about children, here presents ten short stories, in which little
      children are depicted in her inimitable style. Some of them have
      a Christmas flavour; all convey in an attractive form some
      lessons which young folks, and old folks too, would be none the
      worse for learning, as in 'My Pretty,' 'The Gold Scissors,' and
      'The Princess and the Fairy,' in which the receipt for happiness
      is given as unselfishness and shared blessings.

  JERRY DODDS, MILLIONAIRE: A School Yarn of Merriment and Mystery. By
  H. BARROW-NORTH. With six Illustrations by Harold Copping.      3/6

      Jerry Dodds is the good-hearted and open-handed son of a South
      African millionaire, and his fortunes are traced from the time
      he enters Westpool School until he is kidnapped, and recovered
      in a marvellous way. There are lively times at Westpool--a fire,
      a steamer adventure, a feast to his school chums given by Jerry
      Dodds, and abundant adventures, which any boy will follow with
      breathless interest. The youth of Westpool School are as bright,
      healthy, mischief-making, and mirth-provoking youngsters as any
      boy might wish to know. Out of one prank into another seems to
      have been their motto.

  by Arthur Rackham.                                              3/6

      Mr Charles R. Kenyon, author of the popular story, _The Young
      Ranchmen_, here tells a thrilling tale of adventure in which
      three old chums, in the search for the Inca's treasure in
      the remote regions of the mighty Andes, procure a little
      steam-launch for the navigation of the Amazon and some of its
      feeders, such as the Ucayali. Their whole course teems with
      remarkable experiences and adventures, and the climax is reached
      when, after several fights with strange tribes, they are shut up
      as prisoners in the Incala's treasure-chamber. How they escape,
      discover gold in great plenty, and begin a large colonisation
      scheme is told in a spirited manner.

  OUT OF BOUNDS: A Series of School Stories. By ANDREW HOME. With
  eight Illustrations by Harold Copping.                          3/6

      Mr Andrew Home understands and can write about the average
      schoolboy with clearness, humour, and adequate knowledge. In
      this gathering of short stories many phases of boy-life are
      dealt with, in and out of school. There are humorous adventures,
      some of which are on the point of ending tragically. All the
      stories are wholesome and entertaining, and inculcate the
      virtues of truthfulness, sympathy, bravery, and attention to
      duty in the battle of life.

  MORE ANIMAL STORIES. Edited by Robert Cochrane. Including _Rab and
  his Friends_, by Dr John Brown. Fully Illustrated.              2/6

      One of the finest animal stones ever written, Dr John Brown's
      _Rab and his Friends_, is placed in the forefront of this
      volume, with an illustration from the painting of this subject
      by W. G. Stevenson, R.S.A. Like its predecessor, _Four Hundred
      Animal Stories_, it comprises a gathering of interesting,
      pathetic, or amusing animal tales, from _Chambers's Journal_,
      and from the works of Captain Brown, Charles Boner, Edward
      Jesse, John M'Diarmid, and Christopher North. Mary Russell
      Mitford found stories of which the animal world were the heroes
      'more touching than the grander histories of men and women.'
      Though the proper study of mankind is man, much may he learned
      by such stories of sympathy and kindness to the lower creation.
      A closing chapter bears on kindness to animals, as do also many
      of the illustrations.

  by Jessie Wilson.                                                1/

      No reader of this author's _Laddie_ has ever been able quite to
      forget that pathetic story. After a lapse of many years the
      same, writer has written its counterpart, in which the heroine,
      booked as a nurse for South Africa, stays at home for the
      apparently less heroic duty of keeping house for a rather
      shiftless father, and in doing so she develops much quiet
      heroism and unselfishness, shown further in her nursing work in
      the village, during which she falls a victim to an epidemic. The
      story shows how a very quiet life may be as heroic as one spent
      amid the rude alarms of war.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
