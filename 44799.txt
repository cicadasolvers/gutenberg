BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD, K.G.

ON of Isaac D'Israeli, author of _Curiosities of Literature_, of Jewish
extraction; born in London 21st December, 1805; published his political
novel, _Vivian Grey_, 1825; travelled in the East between 1828 and 1831;
contested Wycombe in 1831, and Marylebone, 1833, both unsuccessfully;
was returned for Maidstone, 1837; for Shrewsbury, 1841; for Bucks, 1847;
member of Sir R. Peel's party until Peel became a convert to Free
Trade, from which time Mr. Disraeli allied himself closely with the
Conservatives, of whom he became the leader in the House of Commons
after the death of Lord George Bentinck in 1848; conspicuous for his
attacks on Peel in Parliament; Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord
Derby's first Ministry, 1852; and in his second, 1858-9; in 1859 brought
in a Reform Bill which was defeated by the Whigs; again Chancellor of
the Exchequer in Lord Derby's third Ministry, July, 1866; brought in a
second Reform Bill, based on Household Suffrage, which was passed, 1867;
on Lord Derby's resignation, February, 1868, became Prime Minister,
which office he resigned at the end of the year; on Mr. Gladstone's
Government resigning office, in consequence of their defeat on the Irish
University Bill, March, 1873, Mr. Disraeli was commissioned by the Queen
to form a Ministry, but declined to do so under the then circumstances.
On Mr. Gladstone appealing to the country in 1874, the election returns
placed him in a minority, and he resigned without meeting the new
Parliament; Mr. Disraeli succeeded him as Prime Minister and formed his
cabinet, March, 1874; created Earl of Beaconsfield, August, 1876; first
Plenipotentiary for Great Britain at the Congress of Berlin, 1878, and
K.G. Lord Beaconsfield's principal novels (besides _Vivian Grey_) are
_The Young Duke, Henrietta Temple, and Venetia_, and, since his entrance
on political life, _Coningsby, Sybil, Tancred, and Lothair._

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
