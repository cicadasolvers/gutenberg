HUMPTY DUMPTY.

  [Illustration
  (Bare Humpty sitting)]

Humpty-Dumpty was a smooth, round little chap, with a
winning smile, and a great golden heart in his broad
breast.

Only one thing troubled Humpty, and that was, that he
might fall and crack his thin, white skin; he wished
to be hard, all the way through, for he felt his heart
wabble when he walked, or ran about, so off he went to
the Black Hen for advice.

This Hen was kind and wise, so she was just the one,
for him to go to with his trouble.

"Your father, Old Humpty," said the Hen, "was very
foolish, and would take warning from no one; you know
what the poet said of him:

  'Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall,
  Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall;
  All the king's horses, and all the king's men
  Cannot put Humpty-Dumpty together again.'

  [Illustration
  (Humpty talks to the Hen)]

"So you see, he came to a very bad end, just because
he was reckless, and would not take a hint from any
one, he was much worse than a scrambled egg; the king,
his horses and his men, did all they could for him,
but his case was hopeless," and the Hen shook her head
sadly.

  [Illustration
  (Humpty's father after his fall)]

"What you must do," continued the Hen, as she wiped
a tear from her bright blue eye, "is to go to the
Farmer's Wife, next door, and tell her to put you into
a pot of boiling hot water; your skin is so hard and
smooth, it will not hurt you, and when you come out,
you may do as you wish, nothing can break you, you can
tumble about to your heart's content, and you will not
break, nor even dent yourself."

So Humpty rolled in next door, and told the Farmer's
Wife that he wanted to be put into boiling hot water
as he was too brittle to be of any use to himself or
to any one else.

  [Illustration
  (Humpty talks to the farmer's wife)]

"Indeed you shall," said the Farmer's Wife, "what is
more I shall wrap you up in a piece of spotted calico,
so that you will have a nice colored dress; you will
come out, looking as bright as an Easter Egg."

  [Illustration
  (Humpty in his calico bundle goes into the pot)]

So she tied him up in a gay new rag, and dropped him
into the copper kettle of boiling water that was on
the hearth.

It was pretty hot for Humpty at first, but he soon got
used to it, and was happy, for he felt himself getting
harder every minute.

He did not have to stay in the water long, before he
was quite well done, and as hard as a brick all the
way through; so, untying the rag, he jumped out of the
kettle as tough and as bright as any hard boiled Egg.

  [Illustration
  (Decorated Humpty emerges from the pot)]

The calico had marked him from head to foot with big,
bright, red spots, he was as gaudy as a circus clown,
and as nimble and merry as one.

  [Illustration
  (Humpty jumps from a high shelf)]

The Farmer's Wife shook with laughter to see the
pranks of the little fellow, for he frolicked and
frisked about from table to chair, and mantelpiece; he
would fall from the shelf to the floor, just to show
how hard he was; and after thanking the good woman
most politely, for the service she had done him, he
walked out into the sunshine, on the clothes-line,
like a rope dancer, to see the wide, wide world.

       *       *       *       *       *

  [Illustration
  (Full Page: Humpty walks a tightrope while farmer's
  wife looks on)]

  [Illustration
  (Humpty sits on a wall playing the banjo)]

Of the travels of Humpty-Dumpty much could be said;
he went East, West, North and South; he sailed the
seas, he walked and rode on the land through all the
Countries of the Earth, and all his life long he was
happy and content.

  [Illustration
  (Full Page: Humpty rides a mouse jumping a hurdle)]

  [Illustration
  (Old man with ear trumpet listens to Humpty
  singing)]

Sometimes as a clown, in a circus, he would make fun
for old and young; again, as a wandering minstrel,
he twanged the strings of his banjo and sung a merry
song, and so on through all his travels, he would
lighten the cares of others, and make them forget
their sorrows, and fill every heart with joy.

  [Illustration
  (Humpty greets little girl with doll)]

But wherever he went, in sunshine or in rain, he never
forgot to sing the praises of the wise Black Hen nor
the good, kind Farmer's Wife, who had started him in
life, _hardened_ against sorrow, with a big heart in
the right place, for the cheer and comfort of OTHERS.

Denslow's Picture Books for Children

For these books W. W. Denslow has revised and
adapted several of the best classical fairy tales.
He has improved these stories by elimination of
all coarseness, cruelty, and everything that might
frighten children. They are new; more beautiful and
striking in both text and picture than any children's
books heretofore published. Each book is filled with
pictures of action and fun in brilliant colors. The
twelve books are uniform in size.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
