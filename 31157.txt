                                 PREFACE


The renderings contained in this volume are chosen from a quantity of
material, much of which had to be set aside as, for various reasons,
unsuitable. But, as can be understood, in process of reading, thoughts
linked themselves to the memory, and echoes of music, much of it
surpassingly sweet, lingered, and from those echoes and thoughts the
Centos and Suggestions have been formed. The phrases containing the
thoughts, and the echoes repeating the music, have been woven together to
form the fabric which is shewn here.

This volume is presented because the author believes that the hymnody of
the West must find much of its finest enrichment in the praise literature
of the Church of the East. It would be presumptuous to think that these
renderings and suggestions are at all a worthy expression of the noble
and richly varied praise of the Eastern Church; but they constitute,
together with those contained in two former volumes by the present
author, perhaps one-half of all the pieces which have yet appeared in
English verse.

All the renderings in this collection appear for the first time. If any
one thinks he has reason to complain of their quality, let him try to do
better. The field lies untilled for any one who will work it.

                                    I

    O destitute of all defence,
      We bow before Thee now;
    In mercy let Thy mercy come,
      For merciful art Thou.

                                   II

    Our trusting souls in quiet repose
      Would rest Thy love within;--
    O be not angry with us, Lord,
      Nor think upon our sin.

                                   III

    But from Thy high abode look down,
      With tender love the while,
    And save us from our foes who would
      Our wayward hearts beguile.

                                   IV

    For, verily Thou art our God,
      And we Thy people all;--
    Hear us, the creatures of Thy hand,
      When on Thy name we call.

                                    V

    To God the Father, God the Son,
      All praise and glory be;
    And to the Spirit, Three in One,
      To all eternity.

                                    I

    Within Thy courts my praise shall rise,
      O Saviour of the world, to Thee;
    And while I bow, will lift mine eyes,
      Unconquered Might, Thy face to see;
    At eve, at morn, at noon, alway,
    All blessing Lord, to Thee I'll pay.

                                   II

    Here in Thy courts, O Lord, we bow,
      And soul and body worship give;
    Hear us, Thy faithful servants now,
      Eternal God in Whom we live;
    And Thou the Unbeginning Son,
    And Holy Spirit Three in One.

    Why thus deceived?
      And robbed of life divine,
      That precious gift of Thine?
    Why thus deceived?

    Death with his icy hand,
    Severs each earthly band,
      And bears us all away;
    Vain are our earthly dreams,
    Shadows our substance seems,
      And nothing lasts for aye.

                                   III

    Immortal Christ, we cry,
    O let our prayers come nigh
      Thy throne of heavenly grace;
    Rest him whose form we miss,
    Grant him in endless bliss
      A lasting dwelling place.

                                    I

        Thou, Lord, hast power to heal,
          And Thou wilt quickly aid,
        For Thou dost deeply feel
          The stripes upon us laid:--
    Thou Who wast wounded by the rod
    Uplifted in the hand of God.

                                   II

        Send speedy help, we pray,
          To him who ailing lies,
        That from his couch he may
          With thankful heart arise;
    Through Her, whose prayers availing find
    Thine ear, O Lover of mankind.

                                   III

        Oh, blinded are our eyes,
          And all are held in night;
        But like the blind who cries,
          We cry to Thee for light;
    In penitence, O Christ, we pray,
    Give us the radiant light of day.

    The radiance of the brightness
      Of beauty shed by Thee,
    Descend on us who hymn Thy name,
      Sole ruling Trinity.

                                   II

    Victorious nature hymns Thee,
      Thou orb of triple ray;
    For Thou hast hallowed it through grace
      And borne its sin away.

                                   III

    In faith we laud the Father,
      The Spirit and the Son,
    One Nature, One Divinity,
      One God, yet Three in One.

                                   IV

    To Thee our God be glory,
      O Holy Trinity,
    Both now, and while the ages run
      To all eternity.

                                    I

    Thy mighty word commanding,
      The heavens were settled high,
    And earth to Thee responding
      Was spread beneath the sky.

                                   II

    O God of power, Thy servants
      Would seek Thy power divine,
    That they their hearts to love Thee
      May evermore incline.

                                   III

    And gazing on the glory
      That shines in triple ray,
    Our souls shall feast with gladness
      On Thy sweet light alway.

                                   IV

    And of Thy glory shining,
      And of Thy ruling light,
    From age to age Thy servants
      Shall hymn both day and night.

                                    V

    To Thee be lasting praises,
      Immortal Three in One,--
    Thou Father, Son, and Spirit,--
      Now, and while ages run.

    The Dayspring come at last
        And day is near.

                                   III

    For we have found the Truth;
    The Son of Virgin youth,
    The Saviour hath been born
    This glorious festal morn,
        And joys appear.

      Didst bear that cruel Cross,
    And by its agony and woes
      Bring gain for all our loss.

    Ah Thou, our Lord, the Shepherd good,
    Upon that Cross poured forth Thy blood,
    And with Thy last expiring breath
    Didst save Thy flock from endless death.

    Forgiveness bears their souls away.

    For sorrow now hath found my soul.

    In the mortal grave to lie,
      That death might no more enslave us.

    Look for the morn when night is dark and weary,
      Morning shall come when hours of night are spent;
    Clouds hide the sun, and make the noontide dreary,
      Gladness shall cheer you when the clouds are rent.

    Breaks on thy view, shall come the gladness olden
      Shared by the dwellers in those blest domains.

    Would have them come, and come again,
      Nor fainting e'er refrain.

                                   IV

    O Comforter, the Holy Ghost,
      Now, as of old, come down,
    And with the power of Pentecost
      Our drooping spirits crown.




             {exagoreuso kat' emou ten anomian mou to kyrio}


                                    I

    My sin was very great,
      Its burden bore me down,
    I dared not lift my eyes to God,
      So much I feared his frown.
    And sore my conscience smote,
      And all was sad within,
    For I had turned away from God,
      Who loved me in my sin.

                                   II

    I said, "I'll tell it all,
      The sin, the grief, the pain,
    Mayhap He'll pardon my offence,
      And take me back again."
    And then my heart was glad,
      To think it might be done,
    If I but cast myself upon
      The merits of His Son.

                                   III

    I said, "Ah God, receive
      The sacrifice I bring--
    A broken and a contrite heart,
      That is my offering;
    And for His sake Who came
      To bear the Cross of pain,
    Forgive the error of my life,
      And take me back again."

                                   IV

    'Twas then the heart of love
      That I had wounded sore,
    In loving accents spake to me,
      And bade me grieve no more;
    And spake the word of grace
      That made my spirit whole;
    And now the pain and grief are gone,
      For gladness fills my soul.

                                    I

    When the morn comes o'er the hills
      Bringing life, and light, and gladness,
    Scattering our night-born ills,
      Banishing our fear and sadness;
    Christ of God, Thou Light of light,
    Banish then our inward night.

                                   II

    Ah! our spirits pine and die
      In the chill of night that binds us;
    And we cannot see Thee nigh
      For the dark that inly blinds us;
    Morning Star, in beauty shine,
    Let us see Thy light benign.

                                   III

    On our minds Thy peace bestow,
      Let no cruel blast distress us,
    Ever onward as we go,
      May no crushing load oppress us;
    Light of light, when night is near,
    Give Thy peace, and banish fear.

                                   IV

    When the noontide all ablaze
      Fills the heaven with light supernal,
    And we dwell with glad amaze
      In the bliss of the Eternal;
    Light that cheered my life below,
    Still Thy joy and peace bestow.

                                    I

    The promise which the Saviour made
      When His disciples sorrowed most,
    That He would send to comfort them
      The life inspiring Holy Ghost,
    Found its fulfilment when they met
      Upon the hallowed Pentecost.

                                   II

    And ever through the linked years,
      From then till now the Gift is sure;
    And they who sorrow for their sin,
      Or trial's bitter pangs endure,
    And they who mourn, and they who weep,
      Find in the Gift a peace secure.

                                   III

    Vainly we mourn our absent Lord,
      If Thou, the Comforter be near;
    For it is Thine to take of His,
      And make us feel that He is here;
    We still may joy when others grieve,
      And hope when threatening clouds appear.

                                   IV

    Come, Holy Ghost, with us reside,
      Let Thy sweet presence calm our soul;
    And make us strong to fight and win,
      And all our wayward wills control;
    To give us comfort when we weep,
      And bind our hearts, and make them whole.

                                    I

    When sorrow's clouds are circling near,
    And minds are charged with doubt and fear;
    When sun nor moon nor stars of light,
    Break on the darkness of the night;
        Then, Gift of Christ desired most,
        Come to our help, O Holy Ghost.

                                   II

    When disappointment's pangs are sore,
    And wounded hearts that suffering bore,
    Break 'neath the burden by the way,
    And in their weakness, helpless pray;
        Then, Gift of Christ desired most,
        Come to our help, O Holy Ghost.

                                   III

    When like a spectre gaunt and grey
    Bereavement steals the heart away,
    And all is empty, poor, and bare,
    For those we loved were everywhere;
        Then, Gift of Christ desired most,
        Come to our help, O Holy Ghost.

                                   IV

    When for our sins we mourn and sigh,
    And 'neath the Cross prostrated lie;
    When for the conscience crushed by guilt,
    We claim His Grace whose Blood was spilt;
        Then, Gift of Christ desired most,
        Come to our help, O Holy Ghost.

                                    V

    When braced, the soul resolving springs,
    And reaches forth to better things;
    And high above the world would rise,
    To eager snatch the offered prize;
        Then, Gift of Christ desired most,
        Come to our help, O Holy Ghost.

    He came to earth who came from God,
    And left in heaven His blest abode,
        And all the joy He had;
    To share our lot, and all its woe,
    And wander homeless here below,
        All sorrowing and sad.

                                   II

    He came to earth who came from God,
    And ah! our rugged paths He trod,
        And faint, and tired, and lone,
    He bore the burden of our guilt,
    And on a Cross His blood was spilt
        For sinners to atone.

                                   III

    He went to God who came to earth;
    Now sing the new creation's birth,
        And mankind born again;
    For death is dead, and He who lives,
    Eternal life to mortals gives,
        The Faithful, True, Amen.

                                    I

    The joy of earth is fleeting,
      The bliss of heaven remains;
    More sweet than earthly music
      The angel's glad refrains;
    And hearts of saints uprising
      Find vent in sweetest song,
    And lips of saints and angels
      The praise of heaven prolong.

                                   II

    O Christ, who art for ever
      With those whom Thou dost love,
    Thou art the theme inspiring
      The choirs who dwell above;
    The love that brought Thee earthward,
      The love that stooped and died,
    The pardon won for sinners,
      When Thou wast crucified.

                                   III

    Be Thee our theme who linger
      Where Thou didst sorrowing dwell;
    And teach our hearts to love Thee,
      Our lips to praise Thee well;
    And when we come adoring
      To where Thou ever art,
    One song shall rise exulting,
      From one united heart.

                                    I

    Safe in the comfort of Thy grace,
    Give me, O Lord, a resting place,
        From every tumult free;
    From strife of sin, and sense of guilt,
    For lo, my confidence is built,
        Most gracious Lord, on Thee.

                                   II

    There is no other comfort nigh,
    And sad of heart I mourning sigh--
        Lord, Thou alone canst aid;
    Wilt Thou my prayer in anger spurn,
    And from Thy trembling servant turn,
        Whose soul is sore dismayed?

                                   III

    Nay, if I doubting, still believe,
    Thou wilt my faulty prayer receive,
        And grant the boon I crave;
    For 'tis Thy promise I would claim,
    And in the all-availing name
        Of Him Who came to save.

                                   IV

    So shall Thy peace my heart control,
    And fill with calm my troubled soul,
        My every tumult still;
    And thus I learn to trust Thee more,
    For billows surge, and tempests roar
        Obedient at Thy will.

                                    V

    And in the shining of Thy face,
    A man shall be an hiding place,
        And covert from the wind;
    And while the tempest breaks around,
    I peaceful rest on tranquil ground,
        Where Thou, O Lord, art kind.

The Trisagion, or Cherubic Hymn, has been in use in the worship of the
Eastern Church from the very earliest. No form of adoration is of such
frequent occurrence in all the offices of the Church. Originally the
Trisagion (Thrice Holy), was in the exact form found in Isaiah iv. 3, but
as the years passed, additions were made to it to express doctrine both
orthodox and heterodox. The accompanying form is the one found in the
service books, and is in common use at the present time.




                              The Trisagion


Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy upon us.

Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy upon us.

Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy upon us.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;

Both now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All Holy Trinity, have mercy upon us. O Lord, be gracious unto our sins;
O Master, forgive our transgressions; O Holy, look down and heal our
infirmities, for Thy name's sake.

Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;

Both now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Our Father which art in heaven: Hallowed be Thy name: Thy Kingdom come:
Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on the earth: Give us this day our
bread for support; and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
debtors; And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from the evil
one;

Priest. For of Thee is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to the
ages of ages.

Choir. Amen.




The Creed of Nicea, which is the Confession of Faith of the Eastern
Church, was largely formulated at the Council of Nicea, 325 A.D. It was
based upon the ancient creed of Caesarea, one phrase being added to
combat the Arian heresy, viz., _Consubstantial_ ({homoousion}) _with the
Father_; and it ended with, _And in the Holy Ghost_. The concluding
clauses were added at the Council of Constantinople (381 A.D.). The
insertion by the Council of Toledo (589 A.D.), of _FILIOQUE_ (_and from
the Son_) after _from the Father_, and its subsequent adoption in the
West, was made the cause of the separation of Eastern and Western
Christianity, which has continued from the eleventh century till now.




                           The Creed of Nicea


             _The Confession of Faith of the Eastern Church_

We believe in One God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, of
all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only begotten, who was
begotten of the Father before all the ages. Light of light, very God of
very God, begotten, not made, consubstantial ({hymoousion}) with the
Father, by whom all things were made.

Who for men, and for our salvation, came down from the heavens, and was
incarnate of the Holy Ghost, and the Virgin Mary, and was made man
({enanthropesanta}).

And was also crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was
buried.

And rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.

And ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the
Father.

And shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, and of
whose kingdom there shall be no end.

And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, the Life-Giver, who proceedeth from the
Father, who with the Father and the Son is together worshipped and
glorified, who spake by the prophets.

In One Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.

We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins.

We look for the Resurrection of the dead.

And the life in the ages to come.

"Mr. Brownlie has earned for himself the title of hymnologist, and his
work and research are at this day of great sterling value to all engaged
in the study or collection of hymns."--_Bookman._

"We have noticed favourably other works from his pen, and a volume before
us entitled _Hymns of the Holy Eastern Church_ is no less deserving of
commendation. A long introduction describes sympathetically, and even
enthusiastically, the doctrine of the Eastern Church and its worship,
with which Mr. Brownlie is evidently closely acquainted."--_Church
Times._

"Mr. Brownlie is already favourably known as a translator of hymns from
the Greek Office-books.... The Introduction is well written, and should
be of service in dispelling prejudice and ignorance on the subject of the
Church of the East."--_Guardian._

"Mr. Brownlie has performed a confessedly difficult task.... The best
part of the book is unquestionably what the author modestly calls an
Introduction, in which he gives, in the briefest fashion, an entirely
admirable account of the history, sacraments, and worship of the Eastern
Church."--_Saint Andrew._

"The author has succeeded in retaining the simplicity of the originals
while presenting a polished version accommodated to the exigencies of
rhyme and rhythm.... His plea for a better understanding of East by West
is well informed, enthusiastic, and persuasive. The Introduction is the
best compendium we know in small compass of Greek rite and
doctrine."--_Glasgow Herald._

"Mr. Brownlie is of good repute as a hymnologist, partly through his own
hymns and translations, and partly through his connection with the Church
Hymnary, and the companion volume which tells the story of its
contents.... In a valuable Introduction of nearly seventy pages, he tells
us of the history, doctrine, and worship of the Church from whose service
books the hymns have been translated, and his essay is a welcome
supplement to that which preludes Neale's small collection. Mr. Brownlie
is a true catholic, and, in helping to catholicise our hymn books, he is
furthering that unity of spirit which must precede ecclesiastical
reunion."--_Sheffield Daily Telegraph._

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
