FOREWORD


This story-hour material was first published in the Monthly Bulletin of
the St. Louis Public Library in 1914 and was later reprinted in pamphlet
form. It has been slightly revised for the present edition but the form
and viewpoint has not been changed and most of the notes remain as
originally written for the St. Louis Public Library Staff.

The editor has made no attempt to compile a complete handbook on
story-telling but has merely brought together in uniform printed form,
story lists and programs for story hours as they have been used to meet
the needs in the various divisions of the Children's Department of the
St. Louis Public Library. No claim is made to originality, but the
editor assumes all responsibility for the form and standard of the lists
as here presented.

The aim has been to keep the lists brief and to give short, practical
outlines which may be extended.

Since library story-telling is directed primarily toward inspirational
reading, the selections listed are chiefly from literary sources. A
wealth of material in the form of biography and history has not been
included, because books in those classes have been fully indexed by
subject in the library catalogues. For example: a list of Christmas
stories has been included among the lists for special days, but none has
been given for Washington's Birthday or Independence Day. There is,
however, a list of patriotic and historical narrative poems.

Further explanations will be found in the short paragraphs preceding
each list, and in the index to titles of stories.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STORY HOURS FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.


The following programs for story hours for the
little children are suggestive only. It is desirable
that the best folk tales be repeated as often as the
children desire, and that poems should be read or
recited in connection with the stories where there is
a response. The little children should never be held
longer than half an hour, and twenty minutes is
better. The stories to be told together are numbered
1 and 2. This grouping may be changed and additions
may be made from books which have been
duplicated freely in the juvenile book collections,
but the selection should be kept to the standard of
this list. Also, it is not required that the groups
of stories should be used in the order listed.

STORIES FOR OLDER CHILDREN.

The cycle story hours in the St. Louis Public Library
are planned to interest older boys and girls in
great works of literature and to inspire them to read
along one line for several weeks or months. Stories
in a series are told at a definite hour each week to
encourage regular attendance. However, each story
is complete in itself and any boys and girls of nine
years and more are invited to attend whether or not
they are registered borrowers of books.


GREEK CYCLE STORIES.

Greek Myths.

1. The gorgon's head.

2. Three golden apples.

3. The miraculous pitcher.

4. The Chimaera.

5. The Minotaur.

6. The Pygmies.

7. The golden fleece.

_Sources for the story teller:_
  Hawthorne. Wonder book.
  Hawthorne. Tanglewood tales.
  Kingsley. Heroes, or, Greek fairy tales for my children.

    The Hawthorne books are Greek myths interpreted into
    moral stories written in the author's inimitable style. The
    characters are more human and real to the child than those
    in the Kingsley version. Kingsley retains the Greek spirit
    and tells the stories in bold, strong, heroic outlines. They
    are probably more easily adapted than the Hawthorne versions.


Stories from the Odyssey.

1. Adventures of Ulysses with the Lotus Eaters and the Cyclops.

2. Kingdom of the Winds and the Island of Circe.

3. The visit to the Land of Shades.

6. Princess Nausicaa.

7. Battle of the Beggars.

8. Triumph of Ulysses.

_Sources for the story teller:_

  Homer. Odyssey; tr. by W.C. Bryant.

    Parts read or recited from this straightforward, dignified
     translation in blank verse will be appreciated by children.

Homer. Odyssey; done into English prose by Butcher and Lang.

Homer; tr. by G.H. Palmer.

  Both the above are accepted classic prose translations.
  The prose of Palmer is so direct, simple and rhythmic that
  a twelve-year-old child can enjoy it. Butcher and Lang
  use an older English style in the endeavor to make the
  translation an accurate historical document. The archaic
  language with its somewhat involved phrasing is confusing
  to children and makes it less readable than the Palmer
  translation.

Marvin. Adventures of Odysseus.

  This book is for boys and girls to read for themselves.
  So much of the Homeric spirit is retained and it is so well
  done that it will be very suggestive in organizing and preparing
  stories from the Odyssey for oral rendition.


Stories from the Iliad.

1. Cause of the Trojan war.

2. The quarrel of the chiefs and the results.

3. The duel of Paris and Menelaus.
   The great battles and the death of Patroclus.

4. Achilles in his sorrow vows vengeance on Troy.
   The armor of Achilles.

5. Death of Hector.
   Priam and Achilles.

6. The wooden horse and the end of the Trojan war.

_Sources for the story teller:_

  Homer. Iliad; tr. into English by W.C. Bryant.
    An interesting, dignified and scholarly rendition into English
    blank verse.

  Homer. The Iliad for boys and girls by A.J. Church.
    The Iliad translated into direct and simple prose.

  Homer. Stories from the Iliad by H.L. Havell.
    The atmosphere and spirit of the Iliad are well kept in
    this most excellent prose version of the Iliad. It may be
    used with older boys and girls and is a valuable aid in the
    preparation of the stories.

_Sources for the story teller:_

Northern mythology:

Anderson, R.B. Norse mythology.

  A complete and systematic presentation of the Norse
  mythology as embodied in the elder and younger Eddas and
  later sagas.

Brown, A.F. In the days of giants.

  The best form for younger children. A simple narration
  of the main facts of Norse mythology in story form,
  suggesting the strength of the original sagas.

Buxton, E.M. Wilmot. Stories of Norse heroes.

  A very satisfactory collection of Northern myths, including
  the story of the Nibelungs.

Bulfinch, Thomas. Age of Fable.

  An excellent text book. Gives three chapters to Northern
  mythology.

Carlyle, Thomas. The hero as divinity; Odin.
  _In his_ Heroes and hero-worship.

  This essay is most interesting and inspiring to the story-teller
  who is presenting Scandinavian mythology.

Mabie, H.W. Norse stories.

  In this collection the rugged strength of the Norse tales
  is modified by a style that polishes and a beauty which
  (however delightful in reading), could have been present
  only in a vague way in the original stories.

Nibelungen Lied.

Fall of the Nibelungers; tr. by W.N. Lettsom.

  Most of the adaptations are based on this translation.

The Nibelungs; tr. from the German of F. Schmidt by G. Upton.

_Adaptations:_

Baldwin, James. Story of Siegfried.

  A version of that part of the Nibelungen Lied which
  relates to the story of Siegfried. Incidentally the most important
  myths of the Norse gods are woven into the story.
  The most popular children's version, but very freely
  adapted.

Chapin, A.A. Story of the Rhinegold.

  Stories of Richard Wagner's four operas which form the
  'Nibelungen Cycle.' The treatment of the theme is full of
  strength but differs from other versions of the Nibelungen
  story.

Church, A.J. Treasure of the Nibelungs. _In
  his_ Heroes of Chivalry and romance.

  Brief account of the Nibelung story, leading to fuller
  versions.

McSpadden, J.W. Stories from Wagner.

  Contains the stories in simple form of a number of
  Wagner's great operas. The tale of the Rhinegold, as
  given here, is the best of the versions of Wagner for children.

Morris, William. Story of Sigurd the bolsung.

  Very charming poetical version.




KING ARTHUR TALES.

1. How Arthur proved his kingship.

2. The winning of the queen.

3. How the Round Table was established.

4. Three Knights of the Round Table: Sir Launcelot, first champion.


    Who was held by all men to be the most excellent, noble
    perfect knight champion who was ever seen in the world from
    the very beginning of chivalry unto the time when his son Sir
    Galahad appeared, like a bright star of extraordinary
    splendor shining in the sky.--_Pyle_.


5. Sir Tristram, second champion.


    If Sir Launcelot was the chiefest of all the knights who ever
    came unto King Arthur's court, then it is hard to say whether
    Sir Tristram or Sir Percival was second unto him in
    renown.--_Pyle_.


6. Sir Percival, third champion.

7. Quest of the Grail.

    The recovery of the Grail was the crowning glory of the reign
    of King Arthur.--_Pyle_.


8. Passing of Arthur.

    And I do hope that you may have found pleasure in considering
    their lives. For me seemed they offered a very high example
    that anyone might follow to his betterment who lives in this
    world where so much that is ill needs to be amended.--_Pyle_.

_Additional stories_:

Story of Merlin.
The boy of the kitchen, Sir Gareth.
Marriage of Sir Gawaine.
Story of Balin.

_Sources for the story teller_:

Malory, Sir Thomas. Boy's King Arthur ed.
by Sidney Lanier.

    Follows the Malory tales very closely. The greater part of
    the language is unchanged, though the spelling is modernized.
    Lanier has divided the tales into six books, grouping the
    stories around a central hero from whom the books derive
    their name. Book 1. King Arthur, 2. Sir Launcelot, 3. Sir
    Gareth, 4. Sir Tristram, 5. Sir Galahad and Sir Percival, 6.
    Death of King Arthur.

Malory, Sir Thomas. Book of King Arthur and
his noble knights; ed. by Mary Macleod.

    Tales selected from Le morte D'Arthur and simplified. Covers

    stories of some of his knights, Sir Launcelot, Sir Gareth,
    Sir Tristram, and Sir Galahad.

_Sources for the story teller_:

    Baldwin, James. The story of Roland.

    Some of the many legends of French chivalry that cluster
    around the names of Charlemagne and Roland, translated into
    English prose and woven into a story with Roland as the
    center of interest. The main incidents have been derived from
    a variety of sources, but the arrangement and connecting
    parts are the author's own invention, making the whole an
    acceptable and interesting version.

    Church, A.J. Stories of Charlemagne.

    The old tales shortened and compressed but still retaining
    life and color and reflecting the spirit of the times. Five
    of the legends which are distinct in themselves have been
    used. "The four sons of Aymon," "Ralph, the Collier,"
    "Fireabras," "The song of Roland," and "Duke Huon of
    Bordeaux."

    Greene, F.N., and Kirk, D.W. With spurs of gold.

    A short account of Roland and Charlemagne, dealing
    principally with the battle of Roncesvalles.

    Maitland, Louise. Heroes of chivalry.

    Contains a very clear, brief account of the life and
    adventures of Roland, divided into five parts.

    Roland. The song of Roland, translated into English verse;
    O'Hagan.

    The story of the Battle of Roncesvalles, The spirit of
    chivalry, the bravery of the knights, the friendship of
    Roland and Oliver, and the treachery of Ganelon are all told
    in stirring, rhythmic verse.

    Tales of the Canterbury Pilgrims; retold from
    Chaucer and others by F.J. Harvey Darton.

    the author has rearranged the stories in groups. The book is
    charmingly illustrated by Hugh Thomson.

Stories from Chaucer retold from the Canterbury
tales by J.W. McSpadden.

    An excellent rendition of the Chaucer stories. The author has
    followed closely Chaucer's lines and in many places has
    included the original verse. This version will be found
    helpful in the preparation of the ten stories that it
    contains.

Canterbury chimes; or Chaucer tales retold for
children by F. Storr and H. Turner.

    This collection gives the Prologue and six of the pilgrims'
    stories. It follows closely the original verse, but is not as
    attractive as the McSpadden version, although the two are
    similar.

The Chaucer story book by Eva March Tappan.

    Includes eleven stories freely told and simplified. On this
    account may be used for younger children. Some of the
    atmosphere of Chaucer's original tales is lost but the plots
    are made very clear, which is an aid in the preparation of
    the stories.

    Robinson. In a good many places Spenser's original verse has

_Sources for the story teller:_

  Macleod, Mary. Book of ballad stories.

    Includes 15 tales of Robin Hood's adventures taken from early
    sources. The stories are told very briefly and lack the charm
    of the more modern versions.

  McSpadden, J.W. Stories of Robin Hood and his merry outlaws.

    Contains 24 stories of Robin Hood and his band. Not as good
    as the Howard Pyle version, but the best inexpensive edition.

  Perkins, L.F. Robin Hood.

    The history and adventures of Robin Hood retold in verse, and
    attractively illustrated by the author. Good to give to
    children to acquaint them with the ballad form.

  Pyle, Howard. The merry adventures to Robin Hood.

    This is undoubtedly the best prose version of the Robin Hood
    ballads and the best source for the story teller. It fully
    expresses the out of door atmosphere and the spirit of good
    fellowship and adventure that is found in the original
    ballads.

  Rhead, L.J. Bold Robin Hood and his outlaw band.

    A retelling in prose style is good but lacks spirit and humor
    of Pyle versions.

  Tappan, E.M. Robin Hood.

    This collection gives 16 stories of Robin Hood's exploits.
    Some of the stories have been slightly altered, but the
    atmosphere has been kept in the main.

BOOKS ABOUT STORY TELLING.

_Best sources:_

  Bryant, S.C. How to tell stories to children.

    One of the most practical and helpful books on the subject.
    Fine common-sense is used in all that is said on the purpose
    of story-telling, the selection of stories and how to adapt
    and to tell the story. Some specific uses of the story in the
    school room are given besides a graded collection of
    thirty-two stories and a short list of books in which the
    story teller will find stories not too far from the form in
    which they are needed.

  Cowles, J.D. The art of story telling.

    A useful elementary book. Contains about 50 stories in form
    suited to young children.

  Lyman, Edna. Story telling; what to tell and how to tell it.

    Story telling; what to tell and how to tell it. "The purpose
    of this book is not in any way to attempt to give information
    to those who have devoted both time and study to the subject
    or who have had practical experience in story telling, but
    rather to make a few suggestions to those mothers, teachers
    and librarians who are interested in its use as a phase of
    another occupation." The chapters on "Reading aloud to
    children" and "Arranging the program of miscellaneous
    stories" are particularly suggestive. Contains good outlines
    for cycle story hours for older children.

  Olcott, F.J. Story telling poems.

    There is an introduction addressed to the story-teller
    suggesting ways in which the poems may be used. The poems are
    indexed under such ethical subjects as courage, humility,
    etc.

_Other sources:_

  Bryant, S.C. Stories to tell to children.

    Fifty-one stories with some suggestions for telling. There is
    a clear statement of the value to the child of the type of
    story which specifically teaches a certain ethical lesson and
    also the kind of story that has no moral to offer. The author
    believes in telling one to three in favor of the latter kind.
    The book also contains a few principles underlying the
    dramatization of stories for young children.

  Clemens, Samuel L. How to tell a story.

    The different methods required in telling witty, comic and
    humorous stories.

  Houghton, Mrs. L.S. Telling Bible stories.

    The author aims to inspire mothers and teachers to use the
    Old Testament stories more freely in developing the religious
    nature of the child.

  Keyes, A.M. Stories and story-telling.

    The author is head of the Department of English in the
    Brooklyn Training School for Teachers. Besides a discussion
    of method and theory the book contains about 75 stories,
    including a good selection of short stories suitable for
    young children to reproduce.

  MacClintock, P.L. Literature in the elementary school.

    Chapters 4 and 5 are suggestive in regard to analyzing a
    story and the characteristics of a good story.

  Partridge, E.N. _and_ G.E. Story telling in school and home.

    A large part of the book is devoted to the use of the story
    in teaching language, history, nature study and to its place
    in moral education. There are 18 well chosen stories re-told
    from myths, legends, fables and history.

  Ransome, Arthur. A history of story-telling;
    studies in the development of narrative.

    The chapter on "Origins" deals with story-telling outside
    books.

  St. John, E.P. Stories and story telling in
  moral and religious education.

    A book on methods written from a sane point of view. At the
    end of each chapter are many quotations from such authors as
    G. Stanley Hall, Felix Adler, Froebel, and George Adam Smith,
    and also a bibliography.

  Wyche, R.T. Some great stories and how to tell them.

    Emphasis is laid upon the psychological principles and the
    spiritual equipment in telling stories. The epic stories of
    Siegfried, Beowulf and Ulysses are given prominence with a
    retelling of Beowulf and four stories from King Arthur. One
    chapter is devoted to the "Story teller's league" and its
    work.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
