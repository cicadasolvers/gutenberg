                            YOUR TIME IS UP

                            BY WALT SHELDON

              _The Colonel was a career man; and knowing
            what would happen within his lifetime promised
            to be an invaluable asset.... But he had never
              heard of that ancient legend of Faust...._

At first I thought it was just another wrong number. Well, it was, in a
sense--but not the kind of wrong number I thought it was. The ringing
signal burred against my ear in the usual way, then there was a click,
and somebody said, "Office of Historical Research. Zon Twenty speaking."

"Oh. 'Scuse me," I said. "I must have dialed wrong."

That was euphemism--misplaced loyalty, maybe. I didn't dial the wrong
number, and I knew it. But high brass had installed a new automatic
dialing system in the Pentagon as an economy measure, and it produced
so many wrong numbers and entanglements that I think it actually
must have cost more money in the long run than the old-fashioned live
operator system--but then that shouldn't surprise you if you've ever
been connected with the military.

I was about to hang up after my apology. The voice on the other end
said: "Wait! Did you say--_dialed_?"

"Sure," I said.

"Then--" and he seemed surprised, if not downright startled--"what kind
of a phone are you speaking from?"

"Huh?" I said. "What kind? The regular kind. Phone, desk, dial, M-1--or
whatever the Army calls it."

This time his voice went off like a small bomb. "The _Army_?" he said.

"Sure," I said. "What's the matter with the Army?"

And thought: Navy or Air Force type, no doubt. Our allies. Have to put
up with them in the Pentagon. Have to put up with a lot of things--even
being Colonel Lawrence Boggs didn't save you from a snafu dialling
system. I thought: somebody is out to needle armchair colonels this
week. I'll play around with it for a while, maybe find out who's got
the sense of humor.

The voice said, "Look here, are you joking with me?"

"Perish it," I said.

"But this talk about--about _dial_ phones. About _armies_. Why, you
sound like one of those historical tri-vids about the twentieth
century!"

I smiled, without too much humor, shook my head at the phone, and
said, "Look, fellow, come off it, will you? I haven't got time to play
games." I hoped he wasn't some general or equivalent rank in a pixie
mood.

"Wait!" he said. "Wait--please--don't think off! Tell me, what year is
it? Where you are, I mean."

"What year? It's 1955, of course."

"Why," he said, "this is remarkable!"

"It is?"

"Do you know what I think has happened? A quantum inversion."

"Beg pardon?" I said.

"Karpo Sixteen predicted the possibility just the other day! Listen, my
friend, let me ask you just a few questions--"

Then the mechanical voice of the operator cut in. It wasn't a real
operator, of course, just a recorded voice, part of the new automatic
system. These voices gave all the standard phrases and usually at the
wrong time, the way the system was working. The worst of it was you
couldn't argue with them or curse them--at least you always felt a
little foolish afterward if you did.

The operator's voice said, "_I'm sorry. Your time is up!_"

"Now, wait!" said my communicant, his voice fading a little, "Don't cut
us off! Don't think off yet!"

Again: "_I'm sorry. Your time is up!_"

And after that a click, and after that silence.

I jiggled the hook a few times. No result. I shrugged. I hung up and
rearranged the papers on my desk and went back to work, forgetting for
the moment the party I'd been trying to call in the first place. And
forgetting the odd conversation I had just had. No--not quite. Not
quite forgetting it. Queerly, it clung to my mind. What had he said his
name was? Zon Twenty. Sounded like that, anyway. Odd name. Of course
I still thought it was a gag of some kind. Yet it bothered me. Zon's
manner, his tone of voice had been so convincing. What he had said
suggested that in some queer way I had managed to place a telephone
call into the future. But as a sane, normal, recently promoted colonel,
I knew this was impossible.

At lunch I was still thinking about it. I ate in the officers' mess
on my floor and steered my tray through the line. I saw, among other
acquaintances Major "Clipper" Moskowitz at a far table, and remembered
that he was a great science fan, always talking about rockets and
reaching the moon, and that sort of thing--we had one argument about
why a rocket works in a vacuum, such as space, and he hammered the
table and drew diagrams and quoted Newton, and I'm still not convinced.
Anyway, I went over and sat next to Clipper.

"'Lo, Larry. How's it?" he said.

"Routine," I said. "Latest request for overseas duty turned down. I'll
probably die in the Pentagon with my pencil still behind my ear."

We talked of such things for several minutes.

"Clipper," I said finally, "you're the G.L.E. on this future science
stuff--"

"The what?"

"Greatest Living Expert. Latest Pentagonese. Tell me, what do you think
of the possibility of ever being in touch with the future?"

"You mean time travel?"

"I guess that's what you'd call it."

"Time travel is nonsense," he said. "A logical absurdity. By
definition, time is a series of infinitesimally small moments in
succession. Once a point in time is established, it can't be changed,
any more than energy can be destroyed."

"I didn't say anything about changing anything. I was thinking
about--well, talking with somebody in the future."

"Just as paradoxical," he said, shrugging, and taking a huge bite
of braised beef tongue. "If you go into the future--or talk to the
future--the future affects the change, through you. In other words, if
you can't go back into the past, neither can people from the future.
And it's inconceivable that such a thing wouldn't make changes. Maybe
only small ones, but they'd multiply in time. '_Thou canst not change
a flower, without troubling of a star._' That's Francis Thompson. You
step on one spider today, and you affect the evolution of spiders, the
ecology of all other things in the distant future. By a simple act like
that you could destroy or create a whole species to come."

"My head swimmeth," I said. "All I want to know is--"

He wasn't even listening to me. He enjoyed spouting this kind of thing.
"Of course, it's theoretically possible for you to _witness_ events out
of the past, without being party to them. If, for instance, you could
travel away from Earth at more than the speed of light, overtaking the
light waves of an event--say, the Monitor and Merrimac fight--"

"Or the Battle of Gettysburg," I said, loyal to the core.

"--you could look back and see it happen. The future? I doubt it.
Unless in some way time and space actually curve back upon themselves,
as some think."

"Uh huh," I said, and drank my coffee and finally left Clipper
Moskowitz.

       *       *       *       *       *

After that I did manage to forget about Zon Twenty temporarily. It was
a busy week. The draft quota had gone up, and Personnel Planning had
worked out new criteria for classification, and I had to study these to
apply them to analysis. This won't make much sense to you unless you've
worked in a military headquarters yourself. I worked. I had a dim idea
that if I worked hard enough somebody would favorably regard one of my
requests to get sent overseas.

I've got to explain something right here. I don't want anybody to
get the idea I'm a hero type--a professional volunteer. But I'm a
career officer, and overseas duty is the quickest way to tactical unit
command, which is important on the record. The lack of it has kept many
a perfectly good colonel from getting his first star and making that
final big step.

So I worked hard, and of course, sent in another request for transfer,
this time under the provisions of a different set of regulations. And
I didn't think about Zon Twenty again until about a week later, one
afternoon, when the phone rang.

"Personnel Analysis. Colonel Bog--"

He didn't even let me finish. "Well! I've found you again! The man from
the past!"

"Oh, no," I said. "Don't tell me. Not Zon Twenty--"

"Yes, it's I, of course! Seems we've had another lucky accident, and
been connected again. I was despairing of it for a while. Now, for
machine's sake, don't go away this time! I've _got_ to talk to you!"

"It's your dime," I said.

"Dime!" He pounced on it. "That was a monetary unit, when you had
money, wasn't it?"

"Look, mister--"

"You haven't guessed what's happened, have you? We have it pretty well
analyzed at this end. But we didn't really suppose your technology
would be equal to it back there."

"Look, just who are you, and where are you?" I said.

"My name is Zon Twenty, as I told you. I'm an historical technician
in the Office of Ancient Research in Washington, the capital of the
planet, Earth. I'm an Earthman myself, of course. My job is to prepare
studies of ancient civilizations such as yours--"

"Now, wait--what kind of a gag is this?"

"A gag? Oh--that's the ancient term for a joke. Good! I'll make a note
of that!"

"Come on. Who is it? Did Clipper Moskowitz put you up to this?"

"Oh, dear," said Zon Twenty, and I could hear his heavy sigh. "I was
afraid you wouldn't be able to grasp the situation. I'm going to have
to offer proof, I suppose. Look here--exactly what date is it where you
are?"

"I told you. 1955."

"I mean what month and year?"

"It's August 23, 1955--and I think you know that as well as I do."

"August 23. Just a minute ... we'll make a quick tape on the cyb,
here. Ah, yes, here we are. August 23. All right. The nearest date
of significance is September 1st. On the date twenty-one of your
so-called nations reached--or should I say will reach--a new trade and
tariff agreement in the U.N., and this will eventually lead directly to
the free nation federation in--"

"_I'm sorry! Your time is up!_"

It was that blasted recorded voice of the mechanical operator again.

"Hey! Don't cut us off!" I said.

"Hello? Are you still with me? Look here--I'll try to call back! It's
difficult, but I think I can!" said Zon Twenty.

"_I'm sorry! Your time is up!_"

And again the click, and silence.

This time I didn't forget Zon Twenty, neither quickly nor easily. If
it was a gag, it was a beauty: crazy and elaborate, and the acting was
superb. If it wasn't a gag--well, I couldn't yet quite believe that
it wasn't a gag. A week streamed by in a sea of paperwork. My latest
overseas transfer request came back disapproved. Then, on the morning
of September 2nd I opened the newspaper and saw the headline:

    TWENTY-ONE NATIONS REACH
      TRADE ACCORD IN U.N.

I read the story. It was essentially what Zon had predicted--or
remembered--or whatever you want to call it. I was confused now.

That day I didn't work very well. I couldn't concentrate. I am not a
deep thinker, and have no illusions that I am. But one idea presented
itself, starting as kind of hypnotic little glow in the bottom of my
mind, and this grew until I could scarcely think about anything else.

Put it under the heading of temptation. Ask yourself if you would
have been able to resist. Or just forget all the moral and ethical
implications, and accept that I was tempted in this way. If I could be
in touch with this Zon character--if he really was from the future,
and an historical expert, at that--he could tell me all sorts of
things that were going to happen. I could then either predict them or
otherwise adjust my actions to fit them. I could go up so fast it would
make Caesar's career look like a misfit reservist's. I could--

Well, then I started justifying and rationalizing. I could do my
country all sorts of good. I thought along those lines for a while, and
presently even managed to convince myself that my original purpose had
been altruistic all along.

Of course I tried to get in touch with Zon Twenty again. Over and over
again I dialed the number I had dialed the first time I had become
connected with him by apparent accident. I dialed random numbers. I
listened to a long and boring dissertation on permutation of numbers
by Clipper Moskowitz in an effort to devise a system of hitting all
possible combinations. There were an awful lot of possible combinations.

       *       *       *       *       *

My phone rang again nearly ten days later.

It was Zon. He said, "Oh, _there_ you are! I'd about given up!
Look--the quantum inversion is swinging back to normal! This is the
last time we'll be able to talk! So we've got to make every moment
count!"

"Sure," I said. "You bet. Only I don't exactly get it. I don't
understand just how all this happens. If you'd explain--"

"That's not important. Briefly, we use telepathic induction for message
selection. That's why I was startled when you mentioned the ancient
dial phone. And of course we don't have armies any more."

"Yes, but--"

"Listen, Colonel--what was your name? Never mind. You can be most
valuable to me in my research. You can supply details about your time
that simply don't exist any more--"

"Don't exist? Don't you have movies, recordings, magazines, all that
stuff?"

"Of course not. They were all destroyed in the Final War."

"The what?"

"The Final War. You'll hear about it soon enough. If you survive, that
is. Only three hundred thousand did, out of the entire population. They
were the seed of our present civilization."

"Hey, now, wait a minute! What about this war? When was it? When's it
going to be, I mean?"

"There's no point in your asking," said Zon. "You can't change it, you
know. If you could change it, I wouldn't be here. My world as I know it
wouldn't exist. The fact that my time does exist proves, therefore, you
never changed it. Now, if you'll just calm down--"

"Calm down?" I shouted it across the centuries at him. "How can I? How
would _you_ feel? Look, this Final War, as you call it. Is it going to
be soon? You can at least tell me that, can't you?"

"All right. Soon, as all time is reckoned. In your lifetime, I would
say. Now, I suggest that you adjust yourself emotionally and accept
what is inevitable. The best thing you can do is answer a few questions
I've prepared."

I took his advice. I calmed down. "Questions? Well, Mr. Zon, or
whatever your name is, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll make a bargain
with you. I'll answer your questions if you'll answer mine. I'll tell
you what's happening here--anything you want to know--if you look in
that little file of yours and tell me what's _going_ to happen in my
time. A deal?"

He was silent for a moment, and at first I thought we'd been cut off
again.

"Hello? Zon? You still there?"

"Yes, I'm still here." His voice had become oddly quiet. "So it's the
old Faust legend all over again, is that it?"

"I don't know what you're talking about," I said. I didn't--then. "You
just answer my questions, and I'll answer yours. Mine first."

"All right," he said. "Very well."

And I started my barrage. When would the Final War start? He told me.
How would it start? He told me that. Who would be the belligerents,
and what weapons and techniques would be used at first, and what new
ones would be developed? He knew. Where would the major campaigns be
fought--how many troops would be involved? I got the whole story. I
scribbled furiously and put it on paper.

Afterwards, he asked his questions. They were innocuous, compared to
mine. He wanted to know about taboos and marriage customs and slang
expressions and education and eating habits and articles of clothing. I
told him.

I was in the midst of an explanation of the game of Bingo, of all
things, when there was a sudden whooshing and crackling in the earpiece
of the telephone.

"Hello? Zon? Still with me?"

"Yes--but I think the signal's going out. This may be the inversion
passing! We probably won't be able to talk again. Hello? Do you still
hear?"

"I do. Look--one more thing before we go. You said this dictator--the
one everybody hated so much--survived the final series of blasts. He
and his staff. Where were they? Where were they when the blasts came?"

"In a country at that time called Canada. Little place named
Resolution, on Great Slave Lake. They'd dug in there--very elaborate
underground installation."

"And the date you gave me is correct?"

"As far as I know. You're determined to be in that place at that time,
I suppose." He seemed amused.

"You can say that again," I said.

There were more rumblings of static on the line.

"Well, since you're so determined," said Zon Twenty, "one more word of
advice. The dictator and all his followers were afterwards imprisoned
by what populace remained. Small wonder, since they were mainly
responsible for all the carnage. It was a pretty horrible thing. They
were slowly and most savagely tortured continuously for nearly two
decades. So if you mean to be there, at Great Slave Lake, I suggest you
arrange to be on the right side."

"Don't worry," I said. "I'll arrange it somehow. Larry Boggs is going
to live through this, if anybody is--"

"What's that? What's that you said?"

"I said I'm going to live through this--"

"No, no, the name. Boggs. Is that your name?"

"Certainly that's my name. Colonel Lawrence E. Boggs, United States
Army, and--"

He was laughing. He was laughing loudly, uproariously, and, I thought,
hollowly.

The background noise in the receiver had been steadily getting worse.
Now it swelled, like an angry sea. Interference of some sort snarled
and crackled. A sick feeling began to grow like fungus in my stomach.

Suddenly his voice came through again. He was still laughing.
"Generalissimo Lawrence E. Boggs survived all right Colonel, he--"

All the noise cut away suddenly. There was a pinpoint of silence.

Then the mechanical operator:

"I'm sorry! Your time is up!"

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
