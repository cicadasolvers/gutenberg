THE MERRY CHRISTMAS

OF THE

OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.


CHARACTERS.


  THE OLD WOMAN who lived in a Shoe.
  SANTA CLAUS, disguised as a Beggar.
  Ten or twelve CHILDREN, Boys and Girls of various ages.

 SCENE.--_The exterior of "Copper Toe Shoe House," which is set
     at back of platform._

 _Chorus (invisible); air, "Revolutionary Tea"_ (p. 194, "Golden
     Wreath").

    There was an old woman who lived in a shoe;
      Of children she had a score:
    So many had she, to know what to do
      Was a question which puzzled her sore.

(_Head of_ CHILD _appears at 1_.)

    To some she gave broth without any bread;
      But never contented were they,
    Till she whipped them all soundly, and put them to bed,

    And then very happy were they,
    And then very happy were they.

(_Head appears at 2._)

    "Now, mother, dear mother," the young ones would cry,
      As they dropped off with a nod,
    "To train up a child in the way to go,
      O mother, dear, ne'er spare the rod.

(CHILD'S _head appears at 3_.)

    For broth without bread is a watery waste;
      And never contented are we,
    Till with your good stick it is thickened to taste;

(_Three heads appear at 4._)

    And then, oh, how happy are we!
    And then, oh, how happy are we!"

 _Enter_ OLD WOMAN, R. _Her costume, bodice, quilted petticoat,
     sugar-loaf hat, high-heeled shoes, and cane._

    _O. W._ Aha! (_Heads disappear quick._)

    Good gracious! can't I leave the house a minute,
    But what a head's at every window in it?
    Don't let me see the tip of a single nose;
    For, if you do, we'll surely come to blows.
    Poor dears! they want the air. Well, that is cheap
    And strengthening; for they live on air and sleep.
    Food is so high, and work is so unstiddy,
    Life's really wearing on this poor old widdy.

4. Lookout, or Observatory at top of House.]

(_Heads appear, one after the other, as before._)

    Ah me! here's good old Christmas come again.
    How can I join in the triumphant strain
    Which moves all hearts? I am so old and poor,
    With none to aid me from their generous store.

    CHILD _at 1_. Mother, I want a drum.

    CHILD _at 2_.                        I want a doll!

    CHILD _at 3_. Gimme a sword!

    _Three_ CHILDREN _at 4_.  Got presents for us all?

    _O. W._ Aha! (_Heads disappear quick._)

    Poor dears! if with the will I had the power,
    The choicest Christmas gifts should on them shower.

 _Song:_ OLD WOMAN; _air_, "_Comin' through the Rye_."

    If a widdy's with her biddies,
        Living in a shoe,
    If a widdy's work unstiddies,
        What'll widdy do?

(_Heads appear as before._)

    Every mother loves her biddies;
        Many a one have I;
    But where get gifts to fill their fists,
        When I've no gold to buy?

    Aha! (_Heads disappear quick._)

    There is a sprite oft comes this night,
        Whom children love full well;
    But what's his name, and where's his hame,
        He does not always tell.

(_Heads appear as before._)

    Lads and lassies know good Santa,
        With presents not a few;
    Would he were here, my chicks to cheer,
        Living in a shoe!

    Aha! (_Heads disappear._)

    Well, I'll get in, and make the children warm.
    Tucked in their beds, they're always safe from harm.
    And in their dreams, perhaps, such gifts will rise
    As wakeful, wretched poverty denies.

(_Disappears behind shoe._)

 _Enter cautiously_, R., SANTA CLAUS; _his fabled dress is
     hidden by a long domino, or "waterproof;" he has, swung
     about his neck, a tin kitchen, on which he grinds an
     imaginary accompaniment to his song_.

    _Santa._ "You'd scarce expect one of my age"--
    For gray hair is the symbol of the sage--
    To play at "hide-and-seek," to your surprise.
    Here's honest Santa Claus, in rough disguise.
    But 'tis all right, as I will quick explain,
    For I've a mystic project "on the brain."
    I've dropped down chimneys all this blessed night,
    Where warmth and comfort join to give delight;
    I've filled the stockings of the merry elves,
    Who, to fond parents, are rich gifts themselves;
    And now I've come, resolved to make a show
    In that old mansion with the copper toe,
    Where dwells a dame, with children great and small,
    Enough to stock a school, or crowd a hall.

    If they are worthy of our kind regard,
    Christmas shall bring to them a rich reward.
    So I have donned for once a meaner dress,
    To personate a beggar in distress.
    If to my wants they lend a listening ear,
    The rough old shoe shall glow with Christmas cheer:
    If they are rude, and turn me from the door,
    Presto! I vanish, and return no more.

 _Song:_ SANTA CLAUS; _air_, "_Them blessed Roomatics_."

    My name's Johnny Schmoker, and I am no joker;
    I don't in my pockets no greenbacks perceive.
    For, what with high dressing in fashions distressing,
    I can't with a morsel my hunger relieve.
    My stomach so tender, that aches there engender;
    The whole blessed day I am crying out, "Oh!"
    Drat these grand fashions! they wakens my passions,
    A-nippin' and gnawin' my poor stomach so!

(_Heads appear as before._)

    I've had the lumbager, dyspepsy, and ager,
    With tight-fitting veskits and pantaloons too;
    Highsterics and swimins, delirious trimins,
    St. Vestris's dance, and the tick dolly-oo.
    But not the whole gettin', one's body tight fits in,
    Is noffin' to this, which is drefful. Oh, oh!
    Drat these grand fashions! they wakens my passions,
    A-nippin' and gnawin' my poor stomach so!

(_Heads disappear._)

    Now, there's a touching song to move the heart,
    Hark! what's that? I thought I heard them start.

 _Song:_ CHILDREN, _outside; air_, "_Oh, dear, what can the
     matter be?_"

          Oh, dear, what can the matter be?
          Dear, dear, what can the matter be?
          Oh, dear, what can the matter be?
            Somebody's groaning out there!
    A hungry old beggar has come here to tease us,
    By grinding an organ he knows will not please us.
    He hopes it may bring him a handful of pennies,
        To buy him a loaf of brown bread.

 _Enter_ OLD WOMAN, _with_ CHILDREN, L., _from behind shoe. The
     largest hangs on to her skirts, the next in size to the
     largest, until they dwindle to the smallest; repeat song as
     they enter slowly, turn to_ R., _march across stage; turn
     to_ L., _march across again; turn to_ R., _and form across
     stage._

    _O. W._ Now go away, old man. 'Tis very queer
    That you should seek to waste your sweetness here;
    For we've no money, not a cent, to pay
    For music; so you'd better up and move away.

    _Santa._ Alas, alas! and can you be unkind
    To one who's been by Fortune left behind;
    Who has no friend, no money, and no clo'es;
    The hunted victim of unnumbered woes?
    Good dame, I ask not money: if you please,
    A simple crust my hunger to appease.

    _O. W._ Good gracious! Starving! Children, do you hear?
    The old man's hungry: quickly disappear!

(CHILDREN _scamper behind shoe._)

    _Santa._ She drives them in. To me 'tis very clear
    Old Santa fails to find a welcome here.

    _O. W._ We're very poor, have fasted many a day,
    Yet from our door ne'er drove the poor away.

 _Song; air, "Balm of Gilead," by the_ CHILDREN, _who march in
     as before, carrying sticks, on which are stuck apples,
     potatoes, crusts of bread, turnip, carrot, "beat," &c. They
     move around the stage, singing as they pass_ SANTA; _the
     last time, pitch their potatoes, &c., into his tin kitchen.
     He stands_ L. _of stage_; OLD WOMAN, R.

    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
      Down at Copper Toe Shoe.
    Cold potato--tato,
    Cold potato--tato,
    Cold pota--to,
      Down at Copper Toe Shoe.

(_No interlude._)

    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
      Down at Copper Toe Shoe.
    Crusts for breakfast--breakfast,
    Crusts for breakfast--breakfast,
    Crusts for break--fast,
      Down at Copper Toe Shoe.

    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
    Oh, you sha'n't be hungry now,
      Down at Copper Toe Shoe.
    Broth for supper--supper,
    Broth for supper--supper,
    Broth for sup--per,
      Down at Copper Toe Shoe.

    Oh, you sha'n't, &c.

    _Santa._ Well, well, I'm puzzled! Here's a grand surprise.
    Bless me, the tears are dropping from my eyes!
    Thank you, my children. This is quite bewitchin';
    With eatables you've nearly filled my kitchen.
    Ah, little ones! you've learned the better part.
    They are the poor who lack the kindly heart;
    And they the rich, the noble, and the high,
    Who never willing pass the sufferer by.
    Now comes my triumph. Children, speak up bright:

    What day is this?

    _All._            Christmas.

    _Little Girl._               No; 'tis Christmas night!

    _Santa._ That's true. Now tell me who, against the laws,
    Drops down the chimneys?

    _All._            Why, old Santa Claus!

    _Santa._ Bless me! how bright and nice these children are!
    Each eye doth sparkle like the evening star.
    Now, then, suppose I were that ancient sprite,
    What would you ask, to give you most delight?

    _Child 1._ I'd have a sled.

    _Child 2._                  A doll.

    _Child 3._                          A kite for me.

    _Child 4._ Something still better.

    _Santa._                           What?

    _Child 4._                               A Christmas tree!

    _All Children._ Oh, my! Good gracious! Wouldn't that be grand?

    _O. W._ Too grand, my chicks, for you to understand.
    Why, such a tree within our old shoe spread,
    Would from their fastenings tear out every thread;
    Make every peg to start from out its socket,
    And send the buckle flying like a rocket.

    _Santa._ Good, good! there's fun beneath that wrinkled phiz.
    At playing Santa Claus, let's make a biz.
    Suppose me Santa Claus. I bless you all:
    Then from my waistcoat let this oven fall,

    (_Takes off kitchen._)

    Throw off this mantle with a sudden jerk,

    (_Throws off disguise, and appears as_ SANTA CLAUS.)

    And in an instant set myself to work.

    _Children._ 'Tis Santa Claus!

    _Santa._          You're right. I am the man,
    Yours to command. I'll serve you if I can;
    For I have found, good dame, that honest worth
    Can burrow in the lowliest spot on earth;
    That sweet compassion's ne'er so poorly fed,
    But what she finds an extra crust of bread.
    Now, to reward your generous hearts, my chicks,
    Into the earth these magic seeds I sticks;
    These cabalistic words in Hebrew mutter,--
    "Ene, mene, moni, suti, sutter;"
    Presto! appear! and, glittering bright and free,
    Beams on your sight the mystic Christmas tree.

(_Shoe divides, and disappears_ R. _and_ L. _Curtains at back open,
disclosing tree._)

 _Song_: "_We'll gather round the Christmas Tree._" SANTA CLAUS
     _and_ OLD WOMAN _distribute presents to the company_.
     _Curtain falls._

 NOTE.--This entertainment was prepared for a Sunday school's Christmas
 Eve, and was arranged as follows: A stage, fourteen feet square, was
 fitted with a "roll-up" curtain in front. Drapery was hung at the
 sides and back; a Christmas tree, filled with presents, was placed
 well back on the stage, and hidden by curtains arranged to separate
 in the middle. In front of these was placed "Copper Toe Shoe House."
 The rear view represents the frame made of wood, in two pieces, to
 separate in the middle, of the following dimensions: ten feet from toe
 to heel, five feet and one half from heel to top, four feet and one
 half across top, heel about twenty inches long, eight inches high.
 Cover front, in two separate sections, with black cambric; for toe,
 copper tinsel paper; for sole and patch, brown cambric; for buckle,
 silver tinsel paper; the patch fastened only at bottom. A curtain,
 of same material or color as back stage, should be hung in rear of
 shank, that children standing behind may not be seen. A settee is
 placed behind it, on which the children in the dwelling stand. 1, 2,
 and 3 lie upon the stage, and stick their heads out when required. The
 characters can pass between the curtains at back, to their places.
 When the tree is disclosed, all the characters are in front, the
 settee is removed, the braces unfastened, and, at a signal, two boys
 run off the shoe, and others draw the curtains.

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
