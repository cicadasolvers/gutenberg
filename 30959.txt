PHOTOGRAPHIC SURVEY
OF
GEORGE ELIOT'S WARWICKSHIRE
BY MEMBERS OF THE
COVENTRY PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY.


Arbury, South Farm.


                                                         _Photographed by_

Arbury Farm is on the Arbury Estate.  Robert Evans, the novelist's
father, lived there from 1806 to 1820 as land agent to the estate.
George Eliot was born here on November 22nd, 1819, but was taken to live
at Griff House four months' later.  The farm has been much altered.

1.  Arbury Farm, view from garden

                                                            Miss C. NORTON

2.  Arbury Farm, view from garden

Griff House.


George Eliot's home from 1820 to 1841.  The house has not been greatly
altered.  "It was a delightful place to grow up in, and over and above
the charms of the house, farm, garden and fields, there was the high road
just in front of the gate, where she and her brother stood and watched
the mail-coach pass twice a day."  At the back of the house is "a large,
old-fashioned farm-house garden, where flowers, vegetables, fruits and
trees grow in friendly confusion--just the kind of garden in which Hetty
Sorrel gathered red currants."--_Deakin_, _Early Life of G. E._, p. 5, 9.
The dairy is known as "Mrs. Poyser's," but it was erected after G. Eliot
left Griff.  The "Round Pond," into which Maggie Tulliver pushed Lucy and
where Maggie and Tom used to fish, is in a field adjoining.  Griff
Hollows is the "Red Deeps" of the _Mill on the Floss_.

    "Evidently that gate is never opened; . . . and if it were opened, it
    is so rusty, that the force necessary to turn it on its hinges would
    be likely to pull down the square stone-built pillars, to the
    detriment of the two stone lionesses which grin with a doubtful
    carnivorous affability above a coat of arms, surmounting each of the
    pillars."--_Adam Bede_, ch. 6.

53e.  Corley Hall farm, row of walnut trees

                                                           Mr. A. W. HOARE

Bulkington is possibly the village George Eliot had in mind in describing
Raveloe (_Silas Marner_).  The photographs show a hand-loom used in Silas
Marner's day.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
