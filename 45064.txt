A GRAVE CONSULTATION,--"I SHALL LEAVE THEM OUT OF MY CHERRY PARTY."

[Illustration: 0005]


JIM-MY'S AN-SWER.

Yes, the rob-in's nest had

been robbed--their own

rob-in's nest un-der the bush,

with its dar-ling lit-tle eggs of

the true robin's blue! The

nest was pulled out and tip-

ped on the ground, and the

love-ly eggs were gone.



"I know well e-nough," said

Beth, "that those were the

ver-y eggs that your broth-er

Jim-my was a-car-ry-ing a-bout

strung on a straw, Sat-ur-day

af-ter-noon."



"Yes," said Bes-sie, sad-ly,

"he and Dick must have found

our bush and looked un-der

it, and pulled out the nest. If

they weren't my broth-ers, I'd

nev-er speak to them in this

world any more, no, nev-er and

nev-er! I'm sor-ry they had

to come in-to the coun-try with

us, they do _so_ much dam-age!"



"O, you'll have to speak to

them," said Beth; "but when

peo-ple do cru-el things I do

think it ought not to go as if

they had done on-ly right! I

think they ought to be left out

a while, an' I shall leave them

out of my cher-ry par-ty."



Jim-my and Dick were Bes-

sie's broth-ers; but she a-greed,

and the boys got no cards for

the cher-ry par-ty.



"It is be-cause you broke up

the rob-in's nest," said Bes-sie

se-vere-ly. "It is to make you

feel that girls don't like cru-el-

ty to birds!"



Jim-my looked so-ber for a

min-ute. Then he kicked up

his heels on the car-pet. "Ho,

ho!" said he. "_Such_ girls a-

set-ting up to pun-ish us!

Girls that wear whole birds on

their hats all win-ter!"




SOME-THING SWEET.


[Illustration: 9007]


Christ-mas Day some-thing

sweet hap-pened to Ba-by

Ralph--some su-gar can-dy.



Ralph had nev-er tast-ed

can-dy be-fore, and you should

have seen his big blue eyes.



"Some mo' an' some mo'

an' some mo'!" he said.



"Some more next Christ-

mas," said mam-ma. And

now ev-er-y morn-ing Ralph

asks, "Kwis'-mas this day?"



[Illustration: 8007]

Oh, list-en while the chil-dren sing

(The first one's name is

Mol-ly),

So loud their mer-ry voi-ces ring--

(Th e sec-ond one is Dol-ly),

They sound like black-birds in

the spring

(The third is Oua-ker Pol-ly).




A CHRIST-MAS CAROL, LIT-TLE ROS-A-BEL'S AD-VEN-TURE.


Lit-tle Ros-a-bel liked sto-ries

the best of any-thing in the

world; and she be-lieved that

all her lit-tle pict-ure books

were true, and O, how she did

wish she were a stor-y-book

girl her-self, and that such

things would hap-pen to her.

Dear lit-tle Ros-a-bel, she used

to go out in the green lanes

and grass-y dells and hunt for

fair-ies, and list-en for talk-ing

birds and talk-ing flow-ers.



And one day lit-tle Ros-a-

bel thought she would try one

of the sto-ries and see if it

would come true with her.

She chose the sto-ry of "Lit-tle

Red Rid-ing-hood," be-cause

she had a red hood and be-

cause she knew a poor old

wom-an who lived a-lone in an

old house. So she put a pat

of but-ter and a cust-ard-pie in

a lit-tle bask-et, tied on her red

hood, and started a-way. But

there were no woods to go

through, and so no wolf came

a-long. Ros-a-bel called "Wolf!

Wolf!" man-y times, but no

wolf came. When she came

to the old house she tried to

reach the big knock-er. But

she couldn't, so she knocked

with her lit-tle knuck-les. A

ver-y thin, low voice said, "Lift

the latch and come right in!"

Ros-a-bel did, and there was a

poor old grand-moth-er right in

bed, just like the stor-y!



"O, have you any-thing to eat

in that bask-et?" said the voice.



"I have sprained my an-kle

and I can't walk, and there has

no-bod-y been here for two

days, and I am al-most starved,

and I want some-bod-y to go

for a doc-tor. Can _you_ go?"

[Illustration: 0009]

Yes, Ros-a-bel could. A-way

she ran to mam-ma, and mam-

ma and the doc-tor both came,

So Ros-a-bel was not on-ly in a

real sto-ry, her-self, but she al-so

did a great deal of good.




MORN-ING AT OUR HOUSE.

[Illustration: 9010]

When the first gray light

creeps in through the cur-tains

there is gen-er-al-ly a sud-den

nest-ling to be heard in the crib

that stands at one side of the

bed. Soon Ar-thur's curl-y

yel-low head pops up out of

the pil-lows.

"Are you waked up, Dol-ly-

ba-by?" calls a mer-ry voice.

"Coo-ah-goo-coo" an-swers

Dol-ly-ba-by.

"Mam-ma, I want to see

her," says Ar-thur, sit-ting up

to look o-ver.

[Illustration: 8010]

Then mam-ma parts the lace.

cur-tains of Dol-ly-ba-by's crib,

and dis-clos-es the lit-tle sis-ter,

all sweet and ro-sy with sleep,

smil-ing on her pil-low.



"Loves Dol-ly-ba-by," says

Ar-thur, throw-ing a kiss.

Dol-ly makes fun-ny eyes at

her broth-er, and throws up

her fat lit-tle hands. "Ah-

goo-goo!" she says.



"Let me have her, please,

mam-ma," says Ar-thur.



Then Dol-ly-ba-by is lift-ed

o-ver in-to the big crib; and

there is rock-ing and sing-ing

and smil-ing and coo-ing un-til

nurse comes to car-ry both

rogues a-way to be dressed.




MOON FOLKS.

[Illustration: 8011]

See how quiet it is at e-ven-

ing in the house of the Man in

the Moon. The Moon moth-

er sits down to knit baby

stock-ings like the mam-mas

here; and the Moon fa-ther

wears a smok-ing cap as oth-er

pa-pas do--and on-ly just see

what the sweet lit-tle Moon

ba-by has got for a ham-

mock!



"By-lo-by!" the Moon ba-by

sings. "How bright the earth

shines to-night! I like to

swing in the ham-mock by

earth-light!"



"I won-der if an-y-bod-y

lives in the earth," says the

Moon moth-er.



"That is some-thing I sup-

pose we nev-er shall know,"

says the Moon fa-ther.


[Illustration: 0012]


[Illustration: 0013]




LIT-TLE CRUMBS, AND LIT-TLE DROPS.

"Crumbs of Crack-ers" and

"Drops of Milk" were, the

names of two lit-tle girls.

Would you like to know how

they got these fun-ny names?

It was this way: Lit-tle

"Crumbs" was al-ways nib-

bling crack-ers, and lit-tle

"Drops" lived up-on noth-

ing but milk.



They met for the first

time one day by the fence

be-tween their gar-dens. Lit-

tle Drops was sip-ping from

her sil-ver cup and lit-tle

Crumbs was munch-ing her

crack-er. The big sun-flower

thought there must be a dog

and a kit-ty in the gar-den.



"I've seen you out here

twice," said Crumbs bold-ly,

"and both times you was a-

drink-ing milk."



"An' I's seen you two times,

and bofe times you was a-eat-

ing cwack-ers!" said Drops.



Then the lit-tle girls looked

at each oth-er through the

fence. Bold lit-tle Crumbs

spoke first: "I don't like milk."

"I does," said Drops.

"My mam-ma says I was

brought up on one cow."



"Was you once a tru-ly

lit-tle bos-sy calf?" asked

Crumbs.



But Drops did not like that

ques-tion. "You isn't ber-ry

nice to me," she said.



Then Crumbs was sor-ry.

She held out her crack-er.

"Here!" she said. And

while Drops nib-bled, Crumbs,

to show that she was  tru-ly

sor-ry, took a sip from the cup.



And this was tru-ly sor-row

in-deed, for Crumbs don't like

milk to this day.




IN THE DOVE COT--TWO KIND LIT-TLE GIRLS.


[Illustration: 8015]

Whith-er a-way,

Lit-tle la-dies so gay?

"O, o-ver the hill

To Grand-moth-er Dill!"

And what have you there

In your bas-ket square?



"O, pud-dings and pies,

A lit-tle sur-prise!"



Why such good-will

To Grand-moth-er Dill?

"O, ev-er-y one should

On Christ-mas do good!"

Lit-tle maids, good day!

Flow-ers strew your way!



[Illustration: 9015]

"Coo, coo,"

said Pur-ple-

neck, "it is

break- fast

time."



"Y es," said

G r a y-wing,

"I was think-

ing of the cit-y doves. There

was a snow-storm last night."



"Yes," said Pur-ple-neck,

"but they will not suf-fer. I

am told that many a fine gen-

tle-man buys a loaf of bread

to crum-ble up for the cit-y

doves on a win-ter's day."



"H ea-ven bless 'em," said

Gray-wing.




I-DA'S DOLL.

[Illustration: 0016]

Once there was a lit-tle

girl named I-da, who nev-er

had had a dol-ly. She nev-er

had e-ven seen one, but there

was a pic-ture in a lit-tle red

sto-ry-book

of a girl

hold-ing a

doll, and

I-da used to

look at this pic-ture ev-er-y day

and wish and wish she could

have one.

But her home

was a long

way from

an-y store, and

be-side, her

fath-er and

moth-er had

no mon-ey to

spend for

play-things.



Poor lit-tle

I-da felt worse

and worse

a-bout it, and

one night she

cried af-ter she went to bed, and

when her moth-er came and

asked what was the mat-ter she

said:



"I'm so mizh-a-ble for a

dol-ly, mam-ma!"



Mam-ma sat up long af-ter

her lit-tle girl was a-sleep and

thought a-bout it; and the next

morn-ing, when I-da woke,

there sat a dol-ly on the bu-

reau star-ing at her, a queer,

queer thing, but I-da knew

it was sure-ly a doll.



It was a great rag ba-by,

made of an old sheet, and

dressed in one of I-da's pink

cal-i-co a-prons, and it had black

thread hair, and blue but-ton

eyes, a rag nose, and red ink

lips--but oh! how de-li-cious

it was to hold, and hug, and

love! All the sweet names

I-da could think of were giv-en

her: "Pret-ty," and "Dar-

ling," and "Fair-y," and "Sun-

shine." And lit-tle I-da was

not "mizh-a-ble" an-y more.

THE FAM-I-LY ROGUE IS CAUGHT AT LAST.


[Illustration: 0018]




HOW DAN-NY SAID HE WAS SOR-RY.

Dan-ny was a hand-some lit-

tle boy, but not al-ways a

good lit-tle boy. Some-times

he was so naught-y that you

could see sparks of fire in

his soft black eyes, and he

would dou-ble his chub-by lit-

tle hands up in-to fists, and

stamp his feet, and look ex-

actly as though he were go-

ing to strike some-bod-y.



One day when mam-ma

was sick with head-ache he

had one of these bad times

with his tem-per.



"I don't wish to walk with

El-len," he cried, "an' I won't!

I want a play-walk with you,

mam-ma! El-len don't talk

with me, an' she won't let

me drive her at all! I want

a play-walk with my mam-ma,

I say! Do you hear, mam-ma!



Mam-ma heard. She felt

as though the naught-y lit-tle

boots had come down with

a stamp right on her head.

She knew ver-y well it was

nicer for a lit-tle boy to walk

with a mam-ma who would

a-muse him and take part in

his lit-tle plays, than with a

nurse, but she could not go,

and when Dan-ny stamped

and roared, he had to be sent

out of the room quick-ly, and

with-out e-ven a kiss.



It was a much-a-shamed

lit-tle boy that went stub-bing

a-long in the dust right in

the mid-dle of the road a

half-hour aft-er. His lit-tle

heart was strug-gling to find

some way to say how sor-ry

he was. There were no flow-

ers to pick for a nose-gay, and

it was too late for e-ven a

stray black-ber-ry.



But just be-fore din-ner

mam-ma woke, and there was

a great cloud of col-or, red

and gold, right be-fore her,

and shin-ing o-ver it, a pair

of silk-en-fringed black eyes,

so soft and lov-ing and sor-ry

that mam-ma gath-ered her

lit-tle boy, and the great arm-

ful of au-tumn leaves right

in-to her arms, and in one

lit-tle min-ute all the naugh-

ti-ness was loved a-way.


[Illustration: 0020]




MISS ROSE-BUD,

[Illustration: 0021]

Bring the black horse, bring the red sleigh

Miss Rose-bud her-self goes rid-ing to-day!



Once on a time--the story-

book time when an-i-mals wore

clothes and could talk--there

were three mod-el mice. Their

names were Gray Cloak, Fine

Ear and Sat-in Slip-per.


[Illustration: 9022]

Sat-in Slip-per had a spoon of

her own, Fine Ear had a knife,

and Gray Cloak owned a fork.



One day they thought they

would club the knife and the

fork and the spoon to-geth-er,

and keep house. As they

were mod-el mice, they eas-i-ly

a-greed where to live. They

chose Farm-er Jones' cel-lar,

be-cause there were bar-rels of

ap-ples, bas-kets of eggs, and

shelves loaded with good-ies,

and an egg, or an ap-ple, or a

stray cake would not be missed.



"I lived once," said Gray

Cloak, "in the cel-lar of a

wom-an who bought by the

doz-en or the dime's worth,

and she missed the least lit-

tle thing at once, so that fi-

nal-ly I left in dis-gust."



Such good times as those

three mice had! The cel-lar

had a smooth, wa-ter-limed

floor, a beau-ti-ful place to play

mar-bles, blind-man's-buff and,

Kit-ty-kit-ty-cor-ner. They al-

ways ate from the same egg,

and as Farm-er Jones kept his

cats at the barn, there was

noth-ing to spoil their com-

fort for many years.

WHAT PA-PA AND MAM-MA SAW.


One time when pa-pa and

mam-ma were gone, Ann staid

out at the gate and talked

with oth-er cooks, and left

Ba-by Joe and Sue, and Flake

and Fleece all a-lone, and

Ba-by Joe want-ed to "go

bed." So, like a lit-tle wom-

an, Sue took off her own

lit-tle clothes and un-dressed

Ba-by Broth-er, and then Ba-

by Broth-er would-n't have on

his night-gown and cried, and

Ann did-n't come in to help,

though Fleece and Flake

barked to her loud, very loud.



What did pa-pa and mam-ma

see when they came? Four

lit-tle white crea-tures, nest-ed

in two big chairs; Ba-by Joe

and Sue a-sleep in one, Flake

and Fleece in an-oth-er.

A FIN-GER SONG.

{To be said on Ba-by s Fin-gers.)


I. Shall have an ap-ple;


II. Shall have a pear;


III. Shall have a lit-tle kid, of which he'll take good care;

V. Shall have a ride;


VI. Shall have a lit-tle sword, all buck-led on his side;

KATE FEEDS THE FISH-ES.

[Illustration: 9026]



The birds in the grove

know lit-tle farm-house Kate.

The fish-es in the brook know

lit-tle farm-house Kate. She

is the girl that walks a-bout

with her a-pron full of nice

crumbs.



The first morn-ing this win-

ter that the brook froze o-ver,

Kate went down to the bank

and broke the ice with a stick,

and fed the fish-es with bread'

crumbs.




MEAS-UR-ING TOM-MY.

[Illustration: 0027]


Tom-my goes ev-er-y day to

look at a board in the gar-den

fence. There are four lit-tle

hacks in that board, one a-bove

an-oth-er, made with a knife,

the first hack shows how tall

Tom-my was when he was one

year old; the sec-ond how tall

when he was two; the third

how tall when he was three;

and yes-ter-day Nel-ly made a

hack for the fourth birth-day.

CHILD-LIFE ON THE FARM.-- A NO-VEM-BER RAIN.


[Illustration: 0030]




A LIT-TLE MAS-TER.


[Illustration: 9030]


Floss and Fluff were the

hap-pi-est dogs in the world.

Floss knew how to snap, and

Fluff knew how to whine,

and if they had been let to

go hun-gry, or cold, or had

been scold-ed, they'd have

been cross, naught-y dogs.

But Floss and Fluff had

good mas-ter. He was a

lit-tle boy on-ly six years

old, but he was a first-rate

mas-ter. His pa-pa said when

he brought Floss and Fluff

home:



"Now, Fred-dy, just as

long as these lit-tle fel-lows

are hap-py, just so long they

are yours!"



Fred-dy knew what that

meant. He fed his beau-ti-ful

pets at reg-u-lar hours ev-er-y

day, and e-ver-y day he combed

and brushed them, and ev-er-y

day he took them out for a

a frol-ic, and they had their

baths at the right time, and

he nev-er held up a bone and

did not give it to them. Be-

cause he was so prompt and

true and kind, Fred-dy was

hap-py, and so were Fluff

and Floss.




MA-DAME MOB-CAP.


MA-RY E. BRAD-LEY.



This is lit-tle Ro-sa-belle--

No! I beg her par-don,

This is Ma-dame Mob-cap,

Walk-ing in her gar-den.

What a fine cap it is!

What a wide bor-der!

Spec-ta-cles and walk-ing-stick,

And ev-er-y-thing in or-der.



Hop, toads, clear the way!

Bees, hush your hum-ming!

La-dy-birds and but-ter-flies,

Grand folks are com-ing!



Nev-er think she'll look at you,

Vi-o-lets and dai-sies!

You're quite too in-sig-nif-i-cant

For such a la-dy's prais-es.



She must have a king-cup,

And a prince's feath-er,

With a crown-im-pe-ri-al,

Tied up to-geth-er.



That will suit your Maj-es-ty,

Ma-dame Ro-sa-bel-la!

And here's a gold-en sun-flow-er

To make you an um-brel-la.



"Pooh!" says lit-tle Ro-sa-belle,

Pluck-ing some car-na-tions;

"You may keep your sun-flow-ers,

And all their rich re-la-tions.



"Give me a bunch of vi-o-lets,

And one of those white ros-es,

And take your crown-im-pe-ri-al

To folks that have no nos-es."




UN-DER THE EAVES.


[Illustration: 0032]


The ba-by in the house and

the ba-by in the barn, are

great friends. The barn ba-

by is not per-mit-ted to come

in-to the house, but the house

ba-by vis-its the barn ev-er-y

day.



The house ba-by is a year

old, and the barn ba-by is

just a year old too; but the

house ba-by can on-ly take

lit-tle trem-bling steps, hold-

ing fast by moth-er's hand,

while the barn ba-by, if he

can on-ly get out of doors,

throws up his heels and runs

a-cross the fields, and no-bod-y

can catch him. The house

ba-by laughs to see him go, and

dear-ly likes his red hair, and

feel his two stout lit-tle horns,

And I think the barn ba-by likes to

feel the soft hand of

his lit-tle

friend

from the

house, for

some-times

there is salt, and

some-times there

is su-gar on the

lit-tle pink palm,

and the barn ba-

by licks it off

with his rough

tongue. Once the barn ba-by

tried to say, "Thank you."

He tried this way: He reached

his head up and licked the

house ba-by's rose-pink cheek. The

house ba-by was scared, and so was the

house ba-by's moth-er--and she ran in-to

the house with him just as fast as she could; and

then pa-pa laughed at them both, and the barn ba-by

stood and looked over the fence for half an hour.

BO-PEEP'S STOCK-ING.


Bo-peep was Jack Hor-ner's

lit-tle sis-ter. When he had

his Christ-mas pie she was a

wee ba-by. But the next

Christ-mas, mam-ma hung up

her own lit-tle red-and-white

speck-led stock-ing for her.



Christ-mas morning there

was a great time. Bo-peep

sat on the bed, and shouted

"Goo! goo!" and pulled the

things out her-self from the

gay lit-tle stuffed stock-ing.



A lit-tle white rab-bit peeped

out at the top. His eyes were

made of pink beads. He had

a clov-er leaf in his mouth.

Then came a chi-na pus-sy,

black and yel-low and white.

Then a brown mouse and a

white one. The brown mouse

was choc-o-late. The white

one was su-gar: and Bo-peep

bit off the choc-o-late tail

and a su-gar ear at once.



There was a knit dol-ly, in

a bright blue dress and blue

shoes.



And a-way down in the toe

of the stock-ing, there was a

lit-tle chi-na hen. She sat in

her nest. The nest was chi-na

too. Bo-peep took her off, and

what do you think she had for

eggs? Pink-and-white car-a-

way seeds!



When Bo-peep went to bed

that night, the lit-tle red stock-

ing was left on the car-pet. In

the morn-ing mam-ma heard a

rus-tle in the stock-ing, and

shook it. Out ran a gray

mous-ie, a real, live mous-ie!



Two or three of Bo-peep's

lit-tle pink-and-white car-a-way

eggs had stayed in the toe of

the stock-ino-. Mous-ie had

smelt them in the night, and had

crept in to get his share of Christ-mas

So Bo-peep thinks she had

two Christ-mas morn-ings.

Wasn't that fun-ny?

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
