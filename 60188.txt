Transcriber's Note


This book was transcribed from scans of several different copies of the
original found at the Internet Archive. The typesetters of the original
book represented the letter a (with a macron above) as a (with
circumflex above) when italicized, but this etext uses the macron
throughout. Words in italics in this etext were italicized in the
original book. I have corrected obvious misspellings but I've left
variant spellings alone. Some words and names, like _yojana_ and
_Garuda_, were spelled two different ways in the same text. I have
spelled them consistently to avoid confusion.

YUDDHAKANDAM.



SECTION I.


Hearing the words of Hanuman rehearsed properly, Rama, exceedingly
delighted, said,--"By Hanuman hath been performed a very great deed,
rare on earth, and one incapable of being even conceived by any other in
the world. Save Garuda and the Wind-god, and save also Hanuman, him find
I not who crosseth the wide ocean. Entering by main force the city of
Lanka, incapable of being subjugated by the gods and Danavas and
Yakshas, the Gandharbas, serpents or Rakhas, and well protected by
Ravana,--who, living, cometh out (of it)? And who that is not the
compeer of Hanuman in strength and prowess, even entereth into (Lanka),
hard to subdue, and carefully guarded by the Rakshasas? And having so
put forth his strength commensurate with his prowess, Hanuman hath also
performed a great act befitting a servant on behalf of Sugriva.[1] That
servant who, being entrusted with a hard task,--after having
accomplished it, doeth another work in pursuance of (the prescribed
business), is the best of men. That servant is middling, who, deputed to
any task,[2] doth not, albeit capable, perform any other work which may
be dear to the king. And that servant who, entrusted with any work the
king, doth not, although competent, heedfully accomplish the same, hath
been called the worst. Anent the order (which he had received), Hanuman
hath done the work (and more). He hath not been humbled,[3]--and,
further, hath pleased Sugriva. And by seeing Vaidehi, (Hanuman hath),
while reaping righteousness, saved me, the Raghu race, and the highly
powerful Lakshmana. And this pained my mind sore, that I cannot do a
like benefit, returning this dear office of his. Embrace expresseth the
all (of the Deity),[4] and, finding this occasion, I extend my embrace
unto the high-souled Hanuman". Having said this, Rama, with his down
standing on end in joy, embraced the self-controlled Hanuman, who was
present after having finished his speech. Then reflecting for a while,
the best of the Raghus again spoke in the presence of Sugriva, lord of
monkeys. "Complete success hath been attained anent the search for Sita.
But when I think of the ocean, my mind is again sunk in dejection. How
can the assembled monkeys go over to the southern shore of the vasty
deep, difficult to cross? This tidings thou hast related unto me
touching Vadehi, but what are the monkeys to do next about crossing the
sea?" Having said this unto Hanuman, that slayer of foes, mighty-armed
Rama, agitated by anxiety, was then plunged in thought.

  [1] Having seen Sita--which was all that he had been commissioned to
      do by Sugriva, Hanuman has destroyed Rakshasas and burnt Lanka;
      and this he did of himself like a good servant.--T.

  [2] i.e. _performing the entrusted work.--T._

  [3] _By the Rakskasas.--T._

  [4] The commentator explains this obscure passage after his own
      orthodox fashion. The gist is this. Delight is the essence of the
      Deity, and all His incarnations body forth this. Embrace is
      typical of this emotion.--T.



SECTION II.


Then the graceful Sugriva spake words capable of soothing sorrow, unto
Dacaratha's son, Rama, who was wrought up with grief,--"Why, O hero,
dost thou grieve, like one that is base? Let not this be so. Chase away
thy grief, even as an ingrate resigneth amity. Nor, O Raghava, when the
whereabouts of Sita hath been discovered, and when too the abode itself
of the foe hath been known, do I perceive the reason of thy sorrow.
Thou, O Raghava, art intelligent, conversant with learning, wise, and
judicious. Do thou cast away this sorry way of thinking, even as a
self-controlled (ascetic) casteth away any course of thought interfering
with the attainment of his purpose. Crossing over the ocean swarming
with gigantic alligators, we shall enter Lanka and slay thy enemy. Of a
person that is dispirited and poor in pluck and that hath his soul
overwhelmed with grief, every interest droopeth, and he cometh by
misfortunes (one after another). All these heroes, these leaders of
monkey-hordes, who are ardent for thy welfare, are competent to enter
into fire itself. From their cheerful attitude I know this, and firm is
my faith. It behoveth thee so to arrange things that, slaying the foe,
Ravana of impious acts, we may bring hither Sita by our own prowess. Do
thou, O Raghava, so order matters that a bridge may be constructed (over
the main), and that we may behold the palace of the Rakshasa monarch. We
having seen the city of Lanka, established on the summit of Trikuta, do
thou for certain conclude Ravana as slain in battle immediately after
(we see her). Without throwing a bridge over the ocean--the dread abode
of Varuna--even the Asuras and celestials with Indra (at their head) are
unequal to subduing Lanka. When the bridge over the ocean hath been
constructed up to near Lanka, and when my forces have crossed (over the
sea), consider victory as secured. As these monkeys are heroic in fight,
and able to wear forms at will, O king, do not let thy intellect get
stupified and thus mar all interests. In this world, sorrow berefts
people of their prowess. Do thou do even what should be done by a
man--summon thy manliness; for what an actor doeth promptly, conduceth
to his success. At this time, O eminently wise one, do thou realise
goodness through thy energy.[5] Of heroic, high-souled, men like
thyself, on their sustaining an entire or a partial loss, grief undoeth
every interest. Therefore, the foremost of intelligent persons, and
conversant with every lore, thou shouldst along with councilors like me,
strive to beat thy foe. Find I none in the three worlds, O Raghava, who
can stay in fight before thee equipped with thy bow. Thy business
entrusted to these monkeys shall not (anyway) suffer. And soon, crossing
over the boundless main, thou shalt behold Sita. Therefore, O king,
renounce thy sorrow, and call up wrath. Those Kshatriyas that conceive
no anger in respect of their enemies, have their activity annulled; and
all fear furious persons. Drawing nigh unto us, do thou, gifted with
acute intelligence, cast about for crossing over the dreadful deep--lord
of streams--along with us. On these forces getting beyond the ocean, do
thou take it for certain that we have won; and when my whole host hath
reached the further shore, do thou indubitably conclude that we have
obtained victory. These monkeys, heroic and capable of assuming in fight
forms at will, shall slaughter those foes by showering rocks and trees.
If I see any means of crossing the ocean, Varuna's abode, I shall, O
destroyer of foes, deem him as slain in battle. And what is the use of
dilating? Every way thou shalt prove victorious. And I see omens, and my
mind is filled with delight".

  [5] _i.e._ as I understand this rather obscure passage, _prove thou
      good through thy vigor--secure victory to the cause of goodness
      through thy might._--T



SECTION III.


Hearing Sugriva's speech, reasonable and fraught with high sense,
Kakutstha accorded his assent to it and spoke unto Hanuman, saying,--"By
asceticism, or constructing a a bridge, or drying up the
ocean,--competent every way am I for crossing over this ocean. Of
impracticable places, tell me how many there are in (Lanka), which are
incapable of being come at. O monkey, as thou hast seen personally, I
wish to get acquainted with all this. And thou hast at thy leisure duly
noticed in Lanka the number of the army, the inaccessibility (or
otherwise) of the gates, the defence of Lanka, and the dwellings of the
Rakshasas. Do thou faithfully relate this unto me, for thou art
observant". Hearing Rama's speech, Hanuman, offspring of the Wind-god,
foremost of those conversant with speech, again spake unto
Rama,--"Hearken! I will describe unto thee by what method is the city of
Lanka guarded and protected by the Rakshasas, how loyal the Rakshasas
are, the surpassing prosperity of Lanka, the dreadfulness of the deep,
the divisions of the forces, and the number of the elephants, horses,
cars, etc". Having said this, that best of monkeys, knowing the nature
of things, went on,--"Lanka, filled with mad elephants, ever rejoiceth.
She is great, thronging with cars and inhabited by Rakshasas. Her doors
are firmly established and furnished with massy bolts. And she hath four
wide and giant gates. (At those gates) are powerful and large arms,
stones, and engines, whereby a hostile host approaching, is opposed. At
the entrances are arrayed and set in order by bands of heroic Rakshasas,
hundreds of dreadful sharp iron _sataghnis_.[6] She hath a mighty
impassable golden wall, having its side emblazoned in the centre with
costly stones, coral, lapises and pearls. Round about is a moat,
exceedingly dreadful, with cool water, eminently grand, fathomless,
containing ferocious aquatic animals, and inhabited by fishes. At the
gates are four broad bridges, furnished with machines and many rows of
grand structures. On the approach of hostile forces, their attack is
repulsed by these machines, and they are thrown into the ditch. One
among these bridges is immovable, strong and fast established; adorned
with golden pillars and daises. O Rama, albeit Ravana hungereth for
fight, yet is he calm; and he is vigilant and ever engaged in
superintending his army. And dreadful and resembling a celestial
citadel, Lanka cannot be ascended by means of any support. She hath
fortresses composed of streams, those of hills, and artificial ones of
four kinds. And, O Raghava, she is situated on the other shore of the
ocean having its limit far away. And way there is none even for
barks,--and all sides are destitute of division. And that citadel is
built on the mountain's brow; and, resembling the metropolis of the
immortals, the exceedingly invincible Lanka is filled with horses and
elephants. And a moat and _sataghnis_ and various engines adorn the city
of Lanka, belonging to the wicked Ravana. And an _ayuta_ of Rakshasas,
dart-handed, hard to subdue,--and all fighting at the front with their
swords--protect the Eastern gate. And a _niyuta_ of Rakshasas with a
fourfold force, and with the flower of the soldiery--protect the
Southern gate. And a _prayuta_ of Rakshasas, bearing swords and shields,
and skilled in all arms, protect the Western gate. And an _arvuda_ of
Rakhas protect the Northern gate. And car-warriors and horsemen--persons
honored and sprung from noble lines--by hundreds and thousands,--and
irrepressible goblins and _kotis_ of Rakshasas, protect the garrison. I
have broken down the bridges and filled up the entrenchment. I have
burnt the city of Lanka and laid the wall low. Let us by any way
whatever cross over Varuna's abode. Do thou take it for certain that the
city of Lanka is subdued by the monkeys. What is the use of thy
reckoning the rest? Angada, Dwivida, Mainda, Jambavan, Panasa, Nala, and
the general, Nila, bounding and reaching Ravana's abode, and riving the
same consisting of woods and hills, moat and gateway, walls and
dwellings, shall, O Raghava, bring (hither) Sita. If this be so,[7] do
thou order the entire body of the army to be brought; and do thou set
out at the proper hour".

  [6] A kind of fire-arms, or ancient Hindu rocket; or a stone set round
      with sharp iron spikes.--According to Ramanuya, a sort of mace
      about two yards in length, with spikes.--T.



SECTION IV.


Hearing Hanuman's speech duly from the beginning, the exceedingly
energetic Rama having truth for his prowess, said,--"What thou
sayest--'I shall speedily destroy the city of this dreadful Raksha,'--is
true, I tell thee. Therefore, at this very moment arrange for Sugriva's
march. The Sun hath attained his meridian at this proper moment, capable
of conferring victory.[8] Let Ravana carry away Sita (to his own
country),--whither shall Ravana, living, repair? Like a dying person who
hath taken a death-dispelling drug and drunk ambrosia, Sita, hearing of
my preparations for war, shall inspire hope of life. To-day the Northern
Phalguni (is in the ascendant); and to-morrow the moon shall be in
conjunction with Hasta.[9] O Sugriva, shall we set out, surrounded by
the entire host? The omens I witness, augur, that, having slain Ravana,
I shall bring back Janaki. The upper lid of my eye throbbeth; and it
betokeneth that my desire hath indeed been had". Then, honored by the
monkey-king as well as Lakshmana, the righteous Rama, understanding the
import of things, again said,--"Surrounded by hundreds and thousands of
fast-speeding monkeys, let Nila go ahead of this force, for surveying
the route. O Nila, do thou, O general, expeditiously take the army by a
path furnished with fruits and roots, having cool waters of the woods,
and replenished with honey. The wicked Rakshasas vitiate[10] fruits,
roots and water along the way. Thou, ever on the alert, shouldst
preserve these from the Rakshas. And, bounding down into hollow places,
mountain-fastnesses, and woods, let the rangers of the wilds, spy the
posted detachments of the enemy. Let those that are incompetent, stay
here. This business is dreadful, and we should apply our best strength
in conducting the same. Therefore let the foremost monkeys gifted with
prodigious prowess lead forth the choice portion of the army, numbering
hundreds and thousands. And let Gaja resembling a hill, and the
exceedingly powerful Gavaya, and that monkey, Gavaksha, master of the
leaping ones,[11] like a haughty bull among kine, go in the van of the
monkey-host. And let that foremost of monkeys, Rishava, go, protecting
the right wing (of the army); and let Gandha, irrisistible like an
elephant with the fragrant temporal juice trickling down, and the
vehement Gandhamadana, go,[12] protecting the left wing (of the
monkey-army). And, cheering the army, I myself, mounted on Hanuman, like
the Lord (mounted) on Airavata, shall march in the midst of the forces.
And like the lord of wealth and master of riches, mounted on
Sarvabhauma, let Lakshmana resembling the Destroyer, march forth,
mounted on Angada. And let that king of bears, the long-armed Jambavan,
Sushena, and the monkey, Vegadarci, protect the rear (of the forces)".
Hearing Raghava's words, that foremost of monkeys and lord of the army,
the exceedingly energetic Sugriva, issued his orders. And anon those
highly powerful monkeys issuing up from caves and mountain-summits,
began to bound (on all sides). Thereafter, honored by the king of
monkeys and also Lakshmana, the righteous Rama, accompanied by his
forces, set out in a southerly direction. And he marched, surrounded by
hundreds and thousands, Kotis and Ayutas of monkeys resembling
elephants. And he marching was followed by the mighty host of monkeys;
and all those maintained by Sugriva were filled with joy and betrayed
demonstrations of delight. And bounding by way of guarding the flanks of
the forces, and leaping in front of the army for pioneering, blustering,
emitting leonine roars, and uttering cries, the monkeys made towards the
south. And some partook of perfumed honey and fruits, and some bore
mighty trees, holding the sprouts. And some in pride (of strength)
suddenly raised others and threw them down. And some fell and were anon
up, and some brought others down. 'We shall slay Ravana, as also all the
rangers of the night'; thus did the monkeys roar out in the presence of
Raghava. Before (the army), Rhrishabha, the heroic Nila, and Kumuda,
along with many monkeys, went on clearing the route. In the middle were
king Sugriva, Rama and Lakshamana, environed by innumerable powerful and
terrible monkeys. And the heroic monkey, Satavali, surrounded by ten
Kotis (of troops), alone on all sides protected that monkey host. And
accompanied by an hundred Kotis, Kesari, Panasa, Gaja[13] and Arka, by
means of many protected that host on every side. And taking Sugriva
before them, Sushena, and Jambavan, surrounded by innumerable bears,
protected the rear (of the army.) And that foremost of rangers possessed
of excellence, and of restrained senses, the heroic Nila, general (of
the army), kept going round the ranks. And Valimukha, and Prajangha,
Jambha and the monkey Rabhasa, went everywhere, urging on the monkeys.
While thus marching, breathing pride of strength, those tiger-like
monkeys saw that foremost of mountains _Sahya_ crowned with hundreds of
trees, and watery expanses laughing with flowers, and beautiful tanks.
And knowing the order of Rama of dreadful wrath, that terrible and
mighty host, exceedingly terrific and resembling the bosom of the deep,
cowed down through fear, leaving behind cities and villages and
provinces, went like the deep-sounding sea. And at the side of
Dacaratha's son those heroic monkeys resembling elephants, proceeded by
bounds, like noble horses, spurred on. And those foremost of men,
mounted on the monkeys, looked beautiful like the Sun and the Moon half
eclipsed by the two mighty planets, _viz_., Rahu and Ketu. And (thus)
did the righteous Rama proceed towards the South, accompanied by his
army. Then Lakshmana, furnished with consummate sense and promptitude,
who was mounted on Angada, spoke unto Rama, inviting words, fraught with
import. "Speedily recovering Vaidehi, who hath been carried away, and
slaying Ravana, thou wilt, thy end attained, return to Ayodhya, who
shall also have her desire. O Raghava, I see all the great auspicious
omens on earth and in the sky, signifying success unto thee. Mildly and
grateful doth the blessed breeze blow behind the army, inspiring
pleasure. And the birds and beasts are crying in sonorous voices. And
all the points (of the compass) appear pleasant; and the lord of day is
cloudless. Bhrigu's son, Ucanas, also weareth for thee an auspicious
aspect, and Dhruva is without blemish. And all the _rishis_, pure and
furnished with lustre, go round Dhruva. And before us shineth the
grandfather of the high-souled Ikshwakus; the spotless Rajarshi
Tricanku, with his priest.--And stainless and free from disturbances
appeareth Visakha. This is the racial star of us, the high-souled
Ikshwakus. And Nairita, the racial star of the Nairitas, is sore
afflicted and, touched by the rod-bearing Dhumketu is in trouble. All
this is for the destruction of the Rakshasas. At the fated time, those
that are in the clutches of Death, have their stars afflicted by the
planets. And the water is dear and tastes sweet; and the woods are
stocked with fruit. And the odorous gale doth not blow strongly; and the
trees are furnished with all blossoms of of the season. And, O lord,
this host of monkeys appeareth splendid to the height, as did the
celestial host on the occasion of the destruction of Taraka. Seeing all
this, thou shouldst, O noble one, feel delighted". Having thus consoled
his brother, Sumitra's son, feeling enlivened, said this. The
monkey-host went on, covering the earth. And the mighty dust raised by
bears, monkeys, and tigers, having for their weapons nails and
teeth,--with the foreparts of their feet and hands, enveloped the world,
and the splendour of the sun was obscured. And as clouds envelope the
sky, the mighty monkey-host went on, covering up the Southern quarter
with its mountains, woods, and sky. And as they marched covering many a
_yojana_, the streams seemed as if they flowed in an opposite
direction.[14] And they, while proceeding, took rest by pools of clear
water, on mountains covered with trees, on plains and in forests teeming
with fruits. Some moving straight, some moving askance, and some moving
on the earth, that enormous monkey-host went on covering the entire
earth. And they were all of delighted countenances and gifted with the
velocity of the wind. And these monkeys devoted all their energy to the
accomplishment of Raghava's work. And they were displaying unto each
other their joy, prowess and energy. And influenced with the vanity of
youth they set up diverse cries. Some proceeded with speed, some leaped,
some set up cries expressing joy, some were uplifting their tails, and
some were striking the ground with their feet. Some, stretching forth
their arms, were breaking the hills, and others the trees. And others
were ascending the tops of the hills. Some began to make terrible
sounds, and others made a tingling noise. And many others blasted the
creepers with the velocity of their thighs. And some were engaged in
sporting with trees and rocks. And thus was the earth enveloped with
millions and _kotis_ of fearful monkeys. And thus the enormous monkey
host went on day and night. And all those monkeys, delighted, guided by
Sugriva, and taking delight in battle, went on speedily. And they did
not take rest even for a moment, desirous of rescuing Sita. Thereupon,
getting at the mount _Sahya_ covered with various trees and forests,
those monkeys ascended it. And Rama went on beholding the variegated
forest, rivers and fountains of the mount _Sahya_ and _Malaya_. And
those monkeys broke down various trees--_Champakas_, _Tilakas, mangos,
*Prasekas_, _Sindubarakas_, _Tinicas_ and _Karaviras_, _Asokas_,
_Karanjas_, _Plakshas_, _Nyagrodhas_, _Jambukas_ and _Amalakas_. And
seated on picturesque rocks, various forest trees, shaken by the wind,
showered flowers on them. And there blew in those forests filled with
the smell of honey, a wind of pleasant touch, cool as the Moon,
accompanied by the hummings of the bees. And that mount was richly
embellished with diverse metals. And dust issuing from these metals and
thickened by the air, enveloped on all sides the huge monkey-host. There
blossomed in that picturesque mountain-vale _Ketakas_, _Sindubaras_,
beautiful _Vasantees_, _Madhabis_, _Gandhapurnas_, _Kandas_,
_Chiravilyas_, _Mahikas_, _Vanjulas_, _Vakulas_, _Ranjakas_, _Tilakas_,
_Nagas_, _Chutas_, _Patalikas_, _Kobidaras_, _Muchlindas_, _Arjunas_,
_Singsapas_, _Kutajas_, _Pintalas_, _Tinicas_, _Churnkas_, _Neepakas_,
_Neela-Sokas_, _Saralas_, _Ankolas_ and lotuses. And all these trees
were greatly disturbed by those monkeys, delighted with their view.
There were in that mountain many a picturesque lake and pond filled with
_Chakravakas_ and _Karandavas_, ducks, _Chraunchas_ and the mount
abounded on all sides with boars, deer, and terrible bears, lions and
tigers and various other fearful animals, and it was beautified with
full blown lotuses, lilies, _Utpalas_ and various other fragrant trees
growing in the water. And various birds set up their musical choir on
the summit of that mount. And bathing and drinking, these monkeys
sported in the water. And ascending the mount these monkeys continually
bounded. And excited with drink, they crumbled into pieces the
ambrosia-smelling fruits, roots and flowers of the trees. And those
monkeys yellow as honey, delighted, feasted on mangoes, long and
measuring a _drona_. Breaking down the trees, blasting the creepers,
bounding from one tree to another and making the mount _Sahya_ echo,
those leading monkeys went on delighted and excited with drink. Some
ascending the trees, and others drinking, the whole earth was enveloped
with those monkeys, and seemed as if beautified with ripe paddy crops.
And reaching the mount Mahendra, the large-armed Rama, having eyes like
lotuses, ascended the summit adorned with diverse trees. And getting at
the top, Dacaratha's son espied the vast deep filled with tortoises and
fishes. Thereupon, passing by the mounts _Sahya_ and _Malaya_ and
arranging their enormous host, they[15] by and by reached the roaring
deep. And descending therefrom, Rama, the foremost of those who minister
happiness unto all, accompanied by Lakshmana and Sugriva, entered the
forest situate on the banks of the ocean. And reaching the expansive
banks having rocks thereon and continually washed by the rising billows,
Rama spoke saying,--"O Sugriva we have arrived at the abode of Varuna.
Now hath arisen in my mind what I had not thought of before. And this
ocean, the lord of the streams, whose other side is not seen, cannot be
crossed over without some excellent measure. Let the monkey-host be
encamped here therefore, and then concert a plan by means of which they
might get at the other side. And reaching the shores of the ocean, the
large-armed Rama, stricken with grief for Sita, ordered their
encampment, saying,--"O foremost of monkeys, do thou encamp thy host on
the brink of the ocean. Now hath arrived the hour for counsel, when we
should devise some plan for crossing over the main. I fear the Rakshasas
at every step, for they are greatly illusion creating--let the leaders
therefore go to their own hosts and let them not proceed anywhere else,
renouncing them". Hearing the words of Rama, Sugriva along with
Lakshmana, encamped the army on the brink of the ocean covered with
trees. And stationed near the main, the monkey-host in consequence of
their resemblance in colour with the blue contents of the deep, looked
like a second ocean. Thereupon, reaching the shore, those leading
monkeys engaged in concerting a plan to cross over the vasty deep. And
the tumult, of that monkey-host encamped there, was heard above the
roaring of the deep. And that huge army of the monkeys commanded by
Sugriva, and set up in three divisions, were deeply concerned with the
accomplishment of Rama's work. And reaching the shore of the vasty deep,
that monkey host, delighted, beheld the ocean moved by the Wind. And
they waited there beholding the deep of unimpeded expanse, having its
distant shore inhabited by the demons, and thronged with various aquatic
animals. While upheaving its foam on the approach of eve, it appeared
laughing and setting up its surges, it appeared to dance. It increased
with the rising of the Moon and he reflected himself on its breast. That
abode of Varuna was infested with gigantic sharks, whales and
_Timingalas_[16], disturbed with the fury of the Wind, filled with
serpents having flaming frames, and various aquatic animals and rocks
and was fathomless deep. It had picturesque fortresses on its marge and
its other shore was hard to get at. And the _Makaras_[17] and serpents
living therein were moved by the Wind. The waters, as if delighted, were
rising and falling. And having serpents of flaming frames underneath, it
appeared as if sprinkled with scintillations of fire. And that terrible
abode of the demons extended down to the regions inhabited by the
_Nagas_ or serpents. The deep resembled the welkin and the welkin the
deep, and there appeared no difference between them. The sky crested
with stars and the deep filled with gems resembled each other. The sky
enveloped with clouds and the ocean overflowing with surges presented no
contrast whatsoever. The waves of the mighty deep beating at each other
continually, set up a sound resembling that of a trumpet in the sky. It
was filled with diverse gems and its water was poisoned by means of the
air. It was filled with various aquatic animals, and upheaving its
billows, it appeared as if excited with ire. And there beheld those
high-souled monkeys the mighty main agitated by the Wind and muttering
as if with the upheaval of the waves. Thereupon, overwhelmed with
surprise, those monkeys, stationed there, espied the main brimming with
rolling waters and moving as if (off its place).

SECTION V.


There on the northern shore of the ocean the army was encamped and
arranged in order by Nila. And the two leading monkeys Mainda and Divida
patrolled about on all sides to protect the monkey host. And the army
being encamped on the shore of the lord of streams and rivers, Rama,
beholding Lakshmana by his side, spoke, saying--"I know that grief
abates as time passes by, but my sorrow arising from the separation of
my spouse, is increasing day by day. I am not sorry that she hath been
stealthily taken away by the demon--but my sorrow is that her end is
drawing nigh. O Wind, do thou go there where my dear spouse is, and
touching her person, do thou touch me, for I shall then be happy
stationing my looks in the Moon and being touched by thee. Alas! my dear
one cried 'O lord, O lord' when she was taken away. Those words,
revolving burn me like poison. I am now being burnt down day and night
by the fire of desire, having separation from her for its fuel and her
thoughts for its flame. Leaving thee, O Son of Sumitra, I shall jump
into the deep and then shall not this fire burn me any more. This is my
only consolation, for which I draw my vital breath--that myself and she
breathe on the same earth. Like unto a dry land drawing water from a
watered ground, I do live, hearing that Janaki still survives. When
shall I, discomfitting my enemies, behold Sita, having a beautiful waist
and eyes resembling lotus-petals, as a victorious hero beholdeth the
royal Grace. Like unto the sick drinking the _elixir_ of life, when
shall I, raising a little her lotus-like countenance having graceful
teeth and lips, imprint kisses thereon? And when shall she, laughing,
embrace me with her rising breast resembling the palm fruit? Alas that
chaste dime having scarlet corners of the eye, being encircled by the
demons, is wishing for a protector like unto one having no husband,
albeit having a husband in me. How fareth in the midst of the
she-demons, that daughter of the king Janaka, my beloved spouse, and the
daughter-in-law of king Dacaratha? And having those Rakshasas, hard to
repress, slain by me, truly shall she appear like unto the rays of the
Moon extricated from sable autumnal clouds. Sita is constitutionally
slender, and forsooth, she has been greatly reduced by sorrow, fasting
and calamities touching time and place. When shall I, piercing with my
shafts the breast of the lord of Rakshasas, renounce my mind's grief?
And when shall my devoted Sita resembling the daughter of a celestial,
fling herself anxiously around my neck and shed tears of joy? And when
shall I renounce this my sorrow arising out of Maithili's separation,
like unto one casting off his soiled clothes?" The highly intelligent
Rama bewailing thus, the day passed away and the Sun, decreasing
gradually, disappeared at last. And consoled by Lakshmana, Rama,
stricken with thought touching Sita having eyes like lotus-petals,
engaged in rites relating to the worship of Eve.



SECTION VI.


Beholding in Lanka that dreadful and awe-inspiring work performed by
Hanuman like unto the high-souled Sakra, the lord of Rakshasas, looking
down with shame, addressed them all, saying--"That monkey alone hath
invaded and entered the city of Lanka hard to reach and hath espied
Sita, the daughter of king Janaka. He hath shattered the palace, and the
altar of sacrifice, slain the leading Rakshasas, and, in short, agitated
the whole city of Lanka. What shall I do now? And what should you all do
on this occasion? It behoveth you all to give me such counsel as
becometh me and will conduce to my glory". 'Victory is the outcome of
consultation'--this do the sages[18] say. Let us, therefore, O mighty
ones, engage in counsel, relating to the measures we should adopt
towards Rama. There are three orders of men on this earth--the superior
the middling and the inferior. This distinction cannot be perceived
without a knowledge of the signs, and so I shall relate unto you their
merits and demerits. He is said to belong to the superior order, whose
counsel contains the three signs (mentioned below), or who engages in
works after consulting duly with friends capable or with persons having
the same end in view, and some times with others, and who serveth
Providence. He belongs to the middle order who consults his own self
only, depends on the Providence, and engages alone in works. And he
belongs to the inferior order who engageth in works without ascertaining
their merits or demerits, disregarding the will of the Providence and
saying, 'I will do this', and is inactive (at last). And counsels are
also divided into three divisions like unto the three orders of men
(mentioned). That counsel belongs to the superior order in which the
counsellors with their judgment reinforced by a knowledge of political
ethics, are unanimous. That one belongs to the middle order in which the
counsellors after varied discussion, arrive at unanimity in the long
run. And that one is the worst in which the counsellors differ from each
other and agree a little in the long run, with no good result. You are
all gifted with good intellects: do you all unanimously settle as to
what becometh me and conduceth to my well-being. Environed by a thousand
of patient monkeys, Rama, with a view to capture our city, is
approaching towards Lanka. Forsooth, shall he cross over the main along
with his younger brother and a mighty host. He can by his prowess dry up
the ocean and do the other.[19] Rama approaching thus with a hostile
intention along with the monkeys, it behoveth you to devise such means
as might protect my city and army.

 [19] _i.e._ bridge over the ocean.--T.



SECTION VII.


Being thus accosted by their lord, the highly powerful Rakshasas, devoid
of good sense and ignorant of sound counsel, replied with folded palms,
saying,--"Thou hast, O king, enough of soldiers and weapons. Why art
thou smitten with sorrow then? Repairing to Bhagavati, thou didst
discomfit the serpents in battle. The God of Death, living on mount
Kailaca, encircled by _Yakshas_, was subjugated by thee in a great
battle. And that mighty lord of men, proud of his friendship with Siva,
was defeated by thee wrathfully in battle. Discomfitting and slaying the
band of Yakshas, thou didst bring this flowery car from the mount
Kailaca. O lord of Rakshasas, desiring thy friendship out of fear, Maya,
the king of Danavas, offered thee his daughter[20] for thy spouse. O
thou of mighty arms, thou didst bring under thy subjection the powerful
and irrepressible Danava[21] for the pleasure of _Kumbhinasi_.[22] And
entering the region under the earth, thou didst defeat the serpents--and
thus bring under thy subjection Vasuki, Takshaka, Sankha, and Jati.
Those heroic Danavas, the _Kalakeyas_, were greatly powerful,
irrepressible, and proud of the boons conferred on them. And fighting
with them perpetually for a year, thou didst bring them under thy
control, O lord, O slayer of foes, and learn from them the science of
varied illusions, O king of the Rakshasas. O great hero, by thee were
defeated in battle, the heroic and powerful sons of Varuna, followed by
a fourfold division of their army. The dominion of Death is like the
mighty main, having his rod for aquatic animals, agonies for the trees
that cover its islands, the noose for the billows, his attendants for
the serpents and his terrible fever for the dreadful attitude of the
deep. And diving into this terrible deep, thou didst, O king, discomfit
Death himself and win glorious victory. And every one was pleased there
with thy successful fight. The Earth was filled with various heroic
Kshetriyas, resembling Sakra in prowess as she is adorned now with
various trees. Raghava is not their equal either in strength or prowess.
And all those heroes, hard to repress in battle, were slain by thee, O
king. Do thou wait here, O great king; thou needst not take any trouble.
Indrajit alone shall slay all these monkeys. And this one, O mighty
monarch, having celebrated the Mahecwara[23] sacrifice, hath obtained a
noble boon, rarely (attained by persons). Having agitated the ocean of
celestial hosts, having darts and lances for its fishes, showering arms
for its moss, elephants for its tortoises, steeds for its frogs, Rudra
and Aditya for its ferocious animals, the Maruts and Vasus for its
mighty serpents, cars, horses, and elephants for its volume of waters,
and infantry for its spacious shore, this one (Indrajit), taking captive
the lord of the celestials himself, had brought him into Lanka. Then, O
king, liberated agreeably to the injunction of the Great-father, the
slayer of Samvara and Vritra, worshipped of all the celestials, went
(back) to heaven. Do thou, O great king, entrust Indrajit with this
business,--until he bringeth to destruction the monkey-host along with
Rama. O king, thou must not think that this calamity, coming from an
ignoble person is not insignificant. Thou shalt slay Raghava".

SECTION VIII.


Then that heroic general, the Rakshasa named Prahasta, possessing the
splendour of sable clouds, submitted with joined hands,--"I am competent
to baffle in battle gods and Danavas and Gandharbas, ghosts, birds and
serpents,--what then is a couple of human beings? Having been negligent
and confident (in our power), we have all been deceived by Hanuman. But,
I living, that ranger of woods shall not (again) go hence with his life.
All the earth down to the ocean, containing hills, forests and woods,
shall be rendered free from monkeys. Do thou command me. And, O ranger
of the night, I shall deliver (the Rakshasas) from the monkeys; and thou
shalt not have to suffer in the least in consequence of thy
transgression".[24] Then the Rakshasa named Durmukha, growing enraged,
said,--"This overpowering of all of us must not be forgiven--this
flagrant discomfiture of the metropolis of the auspicious lord of the
Rakshasas as well as of his inner appartment by the foremost of monkeys.
This moment marching alone (from hence) will I exterminate the monkeys,
even if they shall have entered the dreadful deep, or the sky, or the
subterranean regions". Then the exceedingly powerful Vajradanshtra,
weilding up a terrific bludgeon, stained with flesh and gore, wrathfully
observed,--"Rama the irrepressible existing, and also Sugriva with
Lakshmana, what have we to do with the weak and wretched Hanuman? This
very day, slaying single-handed Rama with Sugriva and with Lakshmana,
with this bludgeon, shall I return, after having sorely troubled the
monkey-host. And, O monarch, if thou art minded, hear this other word of
mine! Verily he that is fertile in resources and ever ready, compasseth
success. Let thousands of Rakshasas, heroic, terrible, fearful to
behold, and wearing forms at will, appointed by the lord of Rakshasas,
presenting themselves before Kakutstha in palpably human shapes, calmly
say unto that foremost of the Raghus,--'Despatched have we been by thy
younger brother.' Hearing this, he (Rama), summoning his forces without
delay, shall come hither. Then, equipped with darts, javelins and maces,
and bearing bows, arrows and scimitars in our hands, we shall swiftly
and summoning speed[25] set out (from hence); and stationing ourselves
in the sky in bands, and slaughtering the monkey-army with mighty
showers of rocks and weapons, we shall lead it to Death's door. Let us
in this wise decoy Rama and Lakshmana; and if they fall into our design,
they shall, without doubt, lose their lives". Then that hero,
Kumbhakarna's son, named Nikumbha, endowed with exceeding prowess, in
high wrath remarked unto Ravana, destroyer of worlds,--"Do ye, all of
you, stay here along with the great king. I alone shall slay Raghava
together with Lakshmana, and Sugriva with Hanuman, and all the monkeys".
Then a Rakshasa, named Vajrahanu, resembling a hill, in wrath lapping
the corners of his mouth with his tongue, said,--"Do ye, casting off
anxiety, engage yourself as ye list. I alone shall swallow up that
entire monkey-host. Do ye, remaining at ease and without anxiety, drink
_Varuna_[26] wine. I single-handed shall slay Sugriva with Lakshmana, as
well as Hanuman with Angada,--and all the monkeys.

SECTION IX.


Then, in fierce wrath seizing bludgeons, and _patticas_, lances and
bearded darts and javelins, and axes, bows and excellent shafts and
swords, resembling crystelline water, sprung up the Rakshasas, Rabhasa,
and the mighty Suryyacatru, and Saptaghna, and Yajnakopa, and Mahaparcwa
and Mahodara, Agniketu the irrepressible, and the Rakshasa Racmiketu,
and the lusty Indracatru, son unto Ravana--and Prahasta, Virupaksha, and
the exceedingly strong Vajradanshtra,--and Dhumraksha, and Nikumbha, and
the Raksha Durmukha. And, flaming in energy, they all addressed Ravana,
saying,--"To-day shall we slay Rama, and Sugriva along with Lakshmana,
and the helpless Hanuman, who hath damaged Lanka. Then, preventing them,
who had (thus) equipped themselves with all kinds of weapons, and making
them sit down, Vibhishana, with joined hands, again spoke unto them,
saying,--"The wise have asserted that an appeal to prowess should be
resorted to anent a business _then_ only when the end sought cannot be
attained through the three (other) means.[27] Prowess produceth fruit
only in respect of well-advised action directed while carefully watching
(enemies) that are negligent, or captive,[28] or under Divine
affliction. But why do ye intend to discomfit (Rama), who is vigilant,
who desireth victory, who is strong in the Divine strength, who hath
subdued passion, and who is hard to subdue? Who had in this world ever
thought of or reasoned about Hanuman's career over the dreadful deep,
the lord of streams and rivers? O rangers of the night, the strength and
prowess (of the foe) being immeasurable, ye should by no means
recklessly disregard him. And what was the wrong that formerly had been
done by Rama unto the king of the Rakshasas, that he hath carried off
from Janasthana the spouse of that illustrious one? If Khara, who had
trespassed into regions not his own, hath been slain in battle by Rama,
surely a creature should to the best of his might preserve his life. It
is for this great fear that exerciseth us on the score of Vaidehi owing
its existence to this,[29] that she, having been ravished, should (now)
be given up. What is the use of acting so that quarrel may be the
consequence? And (Rama), possessed of prowess, yet ever abiding by
morality, is incapable of initiating hostilities for no purpose.
Therefore, do ye give him his Maithili. And before, he by means of his
shafts riveth this city together with her elephants and steeds,
overflowing with countless gems, do ye give him his Maithili. And before
the dreadful, irrepressible and mighty monkey-host blocketh up this
Lanka of ours, do ye give (back) Sita. This city of Lanka shall perish
as also all the heroic Rakshasas, if thou dost not thyself make over
Rama's spouse unto him. I exert myself to pleasure thee, because of the
fraternity (that subsisteth between us). Do what I say. I say what is
truth and what also is for thy good. Do thou render (back) Rama's
Maithili. Ere yet the king's son, for compassing thy destruction,
showereth sure shafts resembling the rays of the autumnal Sun, having
shining heads and feathered parts, and exceedingly hard, do thou render
Maithili unto Dacarathi. Forsake thy wrath at once, which destroyeth
happiness and virtue; and follow righteousness, which enhanceth
enjoyment and fame. Be thou propitious,--so that we may live (at ease)
along with our sons and relatives! Render (back) Maithili unto
Dacaratha's son". Having heard Vibhishana's speech, Ravana--lord of
Rakshasas--I leaving all of them, entered his own chamber.

SECTION X.


Then early in the morning, like the fiery and refulgent sun entering a
mighty mass of clouds, Vibhishana, fast to virtue and interest, heroic
and possessed of exceeding splendour, playing a perilous part,[30]
entered the apartment of his elder brother, resembling an assemblage of
mountain-summits and elevated like the peak of a mountain, orderly,
divided into spacious rooms,--the resort of the great--inhabited by
august and intelligent persons attached (to Ravana); guarded around by
lusty Rakshasas in limited numbers; having the air agitated by the
breath of mad elephants; with loud blares of conchs, and resounding with
trumpets; embosoming numbers of beautiful damsels, with its high-ways
(overflowing with talk); furnished with doors of polished gold;
embellished with excellent ornaments; resembling the abode of the
Gandharbas, or the mansion of the Maruts; containing heaps of gems; like
unto the dwelling of serpents. And that one of exceeding energy heard
sacred and holy sounds uttered by Veda-versed Brahmanas celebrating the
victory of his brother; and that highly powerful (hero) acquainted with
Mantras and the Vedas saw Vipras worshipped with vessels of curds,
clarified butter, flowers and fried paddy. And the mighty-armed
(Vibhishana) saluted the younger brother of the bestower of riches,[31]
seated there. And that one acquainted with manners, after proper
courtesy, sat him down on a seat decked in gold, which was pointed out
(by a royal glance). And in retirement as also in presence only of his
counsellors, Vibhishana spoke unto the high souled Ravana words backed
by reason, and greatly fraught with his welfare. And having, with
soothing speech, pacified his elder brother and extended towards him the
due civilities, that one, who through height of sentiment had noted
excellence and the want of it, addressed (Vibhishana) in words befitting
the occasion and the place,--"Ever since, O subduer of enemies, Vaidehi
hath come hither, are seen inauspicious omens. Fire, enveloped in smoke
at the time of its being ignited, and thereafter throwing out
scintillations, with its brightness obscured by vapour, doth not
increase adequately even on oblations being poured into it with Mantras.
Reptiles are discovered in kitchens, sacrificial fire-chambers, and the
places of Vaidika recitations; and ants (are found) in clarified butter.
The milk of the kine hath been dried up; and the nobler elephants are
without the temporal juice. And horses, albiet they have feasted on
fresh grass, neigh distressfully.[32] And asses, camels and mules, O
king, with their hair standing erect, shed tears; and although they are
ministered unto medically, they do not return to nature. And crows in
numbers emit harsh cries on all sides, and are seen in swarms at the
tops of edifices. Vultures sit sadly and distressed upon the roofs of
houses. During the two twilights, the jackals, coming in sight, utter
ominous howls. And wolves and other (ferocious) animals, as well as
deer, approaching the gate of the palace in swarms, are heard to set up
loud roars resembling the thunder. Things having come to this pass, even
this expiation, I fancy, is capable of removing the evil omens. Do thou
render back Vaidehi unto Raghava. If I have said this through ignorance
or covetuousness, thou ought not, O mighty monarch, criminate me. All
Rakshasas and Rakshasis, as well as those belonging to palace and the
inner apartment--shall have to experience the evil consequence (of this
act of thine). All the counsellors have retrained from tendering this
counsel unto thee; but surely I must tell thee what I have seen or
heard; and adopting proper measures, it behoveth thee to act so".[33]
(Ravana's) brother, Bibhishana, thus spoke, unto his brother, the chief
of Rakshas, in the midst of counsellors, these words fraught with his
good. Hearing this beneficial, mild and pregnant speech, fortified by
reasons and capable of compassing (his welfare) for the present, past
and the future, (Ravana) who had conceived a passion (for Sita), getting
into a rage, replied,--"Fear find I none whatever. Raghava never shall
have Mithila's daughter. Even if Lakshmana's elder brother should be
supported in battle by the celestials with Indra (at their head), how
can he stay before me (in the field)?" Having said this, that destroyer
of celestial hosts, the Ten-necked one, possessed of mighty strength and
of terrific prowess in battle, then dismissed his brother Vibhishana,
who had spoken truth.

 [30] The project he had conceived, via., converting Ravana to his own
      policy of pacification, was fraught with peril to himself,
      considering his brother's fierce temperament.--T.

 [33] In accordance with my suggestion.--T.



SECTION XI.


The unrighteous king, overmastered by his passion (for Sita), in
consequence of his sinful act as well as the loss of honor he sustained
at the hands of his friends, became reduced. And the occasion for war
was wanting. Ravana, possessed by lust, and continually thinking of
Vaidehi, conceived along with his counsellors that the time for entering
into hostilities had arrived. And sallying forth, he ascended a mighty
car furnished with golden network, adorned with pearls and coral, and
yoked with trained steeds. And having ascended that excellent vehicle,
having sounds resembling those of mighty clouds, that foremost of
Rakshas, the Ten necked one, drove towards the court. And as he coursed
on, Rakshasas, bearing swords and shields, and carrying all kinds of
weapons, went before the lord of the Rakshasas. And (some of) these,
wearing various frightful suits, and decked with diverse ornaments,
went, surrounding his rear and flanks. And _atirathas_ went with cars,
and superb mad elephants, and sportive steeds; and bearing in their
hands maces and bludgeons; and darts and clubs. And as Ravana marched
towards the court, there arose the loud blares of thousand trumpet, and
the uproarious sounds of conches. And that redoubtable and mighty
car-warrior held his course, suddenly making sides resound, and
beautifying the highways. And the spotless white umbrella of the lord of
Rakshasas, being raised up, looked beautiful like the Moon at her full.
On his right and left graced two crystal white chowris furnished with
threads of gold. And all the Rakshasas standing on the ground with
joined hands, bow down their heads to the foremost of Rakshasas who was
seated on his car. Hymned by the Rakshasas with blessings for victory,
that exceedingly energetic chastiser of enemies arrived at the court
constructed (by Vicwakarma). And that highly energetic one in person
entered that court paved with silver and gold, having its heart
decorated with crystal, and gracefully covered with silk, embroidered
with gold; excellently constructed by Vicwakarma, and guarded by six
hundred ghosts. And Ravana sat down on a superior and august seat
consisting of lapises, furnished with a pillow; and covered with a soft
dear-skin. And lord-like, he commanded the envoys possessed of fleet
vigor, saying, "Do ye speedily summon hither the Rakshasas. I fan some
mighty effort hath to be put forth against our foes. Hearing his words,
the envoys began to range Lanka; and going to every house, they
fearlessly collected the Rakshas from places of sport, bed-rooms, and
gardens. Then some set out, mounting cars, and some mounting proud
coursers, and some on foot. And like the welkin filled with fowls, the
city thronged with approaching cars, elephants and steeds. And leaving
their various vehicles and cars behind, they entered the court on foot,
like lions entering mountain caverns. And taking the feet of the
sovereign, and honored by him (in turn), they sat them down, some on
raised seats, some on cushions of Kuca, and some on the floor. And
presenting themselves agreeably to the command of the monarch, they sat
them down each according to his position, before the lord of Rakshasas,
Ravana. And there came also the learned and competent to arrive at
infallible decisions, and they sat them down in order of merit. And
there also came courtiers endowed with virtues, versed in every thing,
and having intelligence for their eye-sight,--and innumerable heroes by
hundreds also (arrived) at that court for ascertaining the course that
would prove beneficial. And then mounting a large, noble and splendid
car, having its parts decked with gold, and yoked with horses, the
magnanimous and renowned Vibhishana went to the court of his elder
brother. And that younger brother (of Ravana), announcing his name,
bowed down at the feet of his elder brother. And Suka and Prahasta were
employed in giving to each a separate seat befitting his rank. And from
all sides in the court there began to spread the odour of excellent
_agura_ and sandal and wreaths belonging to the Rakshasas, decked in
gold and various gems, and clad in costly attires. And no one among
these present at court uttered any thing, or spoke any falsehood, or
conversed in loud accents. And having completely attained their desire,
all of fierce prowess, gazed at the face of their lord. And in the
assembly of those intelligent, and exceedingly powerful persons,
equipped with arms, the intelligent Ravana appeared splendid like the
Vajra-handed Indra among the Vasus.



SECTION XII.


Then surveying that entire assembly, that conqueror in battle delivered
himself unto Prahasta,--general of the forces, saying,--"O general, it
behoveth thee so to order disciplined fourfold forces that they may
successfully protect the city". Thereat, Prahasta, carefully carrying
out the royal behest, stationed all the forces within and without the
city. And having posted the army for the defence of the city, Prahasta
sitting down before the king, said,--"I have stationed the forces
belonging to thee who art possessed of strength, inside as well as
outside. (Now), without suffering thy mind to be agitated with anxiety,
speedily, do what is in thy heart. Hearing the speech of Prahasta
seeking the welfare of the kingdom, Ravana craving for enjoyment spoke
in the midst of his aderents,--"When virtue, or happiness, or interest
is in straits, it behoveth you to (know your course) in relation to
pleasant and unpleasant, happiness and misery, profitable and
unprofitable, and good and evil. No business of mine which ye have set
about after taking counsel, hath ever miscarried. And like Vasava
environed by the moon, stars and planets, and the Maruts, I surrounded
by you, have attained to plenitude of prosperity. I am, for certain,
going to employ you all. In consequence of sleep, I could not inform him
of this matter. After having slept for six months that one of prodigious
strength--foremost of those bearing arms--hath just risen. Janaka's
daughter and Rama's beloved wife hath been brought hither from the
forest of Dandaka, the region ranged by Rakshas. That indolent damsel
wisheth not to ascend my bed; nor is there any in the three spheres,
that to me is like unto Sita. She is slender waisted, and high-hipped,
and her face is as the autumnal Moon resembling a golden image. She is
meek and looketh like the hand work of Maya himself gifted with an
infinite variety of fascinations.[34] And beholding her dainty and
tender feet with roseate soles, and having coppery nails, my mind
burneth (with desire). And seeing her resembling the flame of a
sacrificial fire and the splendour of the Sun himself; and her fair face
furnished with a prominent nose and elegant eyes, I, having lost control
over self, have come under the sway of desire. And my passion,
uninfluenced by anger and joy, capable of producing pallor, and
constantly causing anguish and sorrow, hath rendered me pale. Expecting
her lord, Rama, the beautiful one having expansive eyes, hath solicited
for a year's space; and I have pledged my fair woods to her of graceful
eyes. But tired am I on account of my passion,--like a horse spent on
the way. How can the rangers of the woods, or the sons of Dacaratha
cross over the sea ungovernable and swarming with countless creatures
and fishes? On the other hand, a single month hath troubled us
grievously. Hard it is therefore to understand the course of events. Do
ye act, each as he thinks proper. And although no fear can come from
mortals, yet ye should deliberate (as to what ye should do). Formerly I
had gained victory with the help given by you; do ye in the same way
stand by me now. The king's son, having learnt that Sita is on the other
shore of the ocean, taking before them monkeys headed by Sugriva,
reached Varuna's abode. Do ye so counsel that Sita may be with-holden by
me and the sons of Dacaratha may be slain; but ye must prefer certain
counsel. No other[35] person in this world hath the power to cross the
sea along with the monkeys,--victory, therefore, is undubitably mine".
Hearing the sorrowful speech of (Ravana) afflicted with lust,
Kumbhakarna greatly enraged, and said,--"When just on seeing (Sita) of
Rama along with Lakshmana, thou didst by main force carry her away, it
plainly appeareth that thy mind, like the Yamuna filling her bed, hath
been possessed (by her).[36] O great king, all this (that thou hast
done) is not worthy of thee. If thou hadst at the outset consulted us in
this matter, we would have done what was proper.[37] O ten-faced one,
the king that arriving at certain conclusions, carrieth on his regal
affairs agreeably to justice, hath not to repent afterwards. But those
actions that are done without deliberation, like unto clarified butter
poured in an impure sacrifice, conduces only to harm. He doth not know
what is proper and what not, that performs prior actions afterwards, and
posterior actions first. Others spy holes in the actions of the
volatile; the latter may be possessed of great power,--like swans
passing Krauncha through the hole.[38] By luck it is that Rama hath not
yet slain thee, who hath done this tremendous thing, without reflection,
resembling food mixed with poison. But as thou hast entered upon a
course of action which is improper even in respect of foes, I will, O
sinless one, perform thy work by slaying thy enemies. And, O ranger of
the night, I will exterminate thy foe. Even if Sakra and the sun-god,
even if fire and the War-god, even if Kuvera and Varuna should range
themselves against me, I will fight them. Purandara himself shall be
afflicted with fright when I have my body measuring a mountain, and
furnished with sharp teeth, shall, setting up roars, fight with my huge
bludgeon. Before Rama shooteth a second shaft, to slay me, I shall drink
his life-blood. Be thou comforted by slaying Dacaratha's son, I will
exert to secure blessed victory for thee. Having killed Rama along with
Lakshmana, I shall devour all the principal monkeys. Do thou make merry
at thy will, drink the Varuni, and, with thy mind set at rest, conduct
affairs fraught with thy welfare. On Rama being despatched to the
mansion of Yama, Sita shall come under thy subjection for ever and a
day".

 [34] This reminds one irrisistibly of Cleopatra's. The Bengali
      translators evidently failing to understand _Mayava Mayanirmita_,
      have conveniently transferred the phrase intact to their
      versions.--T.

 [35] I fail to understand _anyasya_, "_no other_ person";--nor does the

SECTION XIII.


Seeing Ravana wrought up with wrath, the exceedingly strong Mahaparcwa,
reflecting for a moment, observed with joined hands,--"The man that,
entering the forest, abounding with deer and ferocious animals, doth not
drink honey, maketh a fool of himself. O destroyer of foes, who is the
lord of thee, that art lord thyself? Enjoy with Vaidehi, taking thy
enemy by the hand. And, O thou endowed with prodigious power, do thou
exerting thy might lead thy life, after the manner of hens, and invading
Sita again and again, do thou enjoy her and derive pleasure (therefrom).
And when thou hast attained thy purpose; what fear can succeed? Alike
when on thy guard, and off it, thou shalt provide against all
exigencies. Kumbhakarna along with us, as well the exceedingly powerful
Indrajit, are competent to chastise the thunder-bearing (Deity) equipped
with his thunder. Passing by gift, conciliation, and dissension, which
have been assigned by the wise as the means of success, I relish the
success in business which is attained through chastisement. O highly
powerful one, we shall, without doubt, by the prowess of our arms,
subdue all these enemies of thine that have come hither". Thus addressed
by Mahaparcwa, king Ravana, honoring his speech, said,--"O Mahaparcwa, I
will relate unto thee, who hast spoken (thus) a secret matter relating
to myself, which befell me to since I saw Panjikasthala, like a flame in
the sky, coursing to the Great-father's mansion. Her pace slackened, as
soon as she saw me, (turn) I feasted on her and deprived her of her
attire. Then she went to the Great-father's place like a crumpled lotus.
That high-souled one received information of all that I had done; and
thereat, waxed enraged, the Deity spoke unto me,--"If from this day,
thou ravish a female by force, thy head certainly shall be riven in an
hundred pieces. It is for this, that with my mind afflicted with fear, I
do not violently force, Videha's daughter Sita, anent lying with her
fair self. My rush is like that of the sea, and my motion that of the
wind. Dacaratha's son doth not know this, and therefore doth he approach
sea. Who wisheth to address a lion that is lying asleep in a cave
resembling Death wrought up by wrath? Rama hath not seen shafts shot by
me, resembling two-tongued serpents and therefore, it is that he
approacheth me. Like a met burning an elephant, I shall, with shafts
shot from bows by hundreds, resembling the thunder-bolt, consume Rama.
And as at the proper hour the risen Sun defeateth the splendor of the
stars, will I, surrounded by a mighty army, overpower his strength.
Neither the thousand eyed Vasava, nor Varuna, is capable of fighting me.
By the might of this army did I formerly conquer this city, governed by
Vaicravana".



SECTION XIV.


Hearing the words of the lord of Rakshasas, as well as the thundering of
Kumbhakarna, Vibhishana addressed the Rakshasa chief, in a pregnant
speech, fraught with his welfare,--"Thou hast been bound about thy neck
by the mighty and huge serpent, Sita, having her breast for its body
anxiety for its venom, smile for its sharp fangs, and her five fingers
for its hood. Therefore before the monkeys, resembling mountain-peaks,
having teeth for their arms and nails for their weapons,--subjugate
Lanka, do thou render Maithili unto Dacaratha's son. And before the
shafts shot by Rama, resembling the thunder-bolt and having impetuosity
of the wind, cut off the heads of the foremost of the Rakshasas, do thou
render Mithila's daughter unto the son of Dacaratha. Neither Kumbhakarna
nor Indrajit, neither Mahaparcwa nor Mahodara, neither Nikumbha nor
Kumbha nor yet Atikaya, O king, can stay in the field against Raghava.
Living, thou, whether thou art protected by the Sun or the winds, or
throwest thyself into the lap itself of Vasava, or enterest the sky or
the nether spheres, shall not escape death". Hearing Vibhishana's words,
Prahasta said,--"Fear know we none whatever from the celestials, or
Danavas, or Yakshas, or Gandharbas, or huge snakes; fear know we none in
battle with birds and serpents. How can fear at all afflict us
proceeding from the king's son, Rama? Hearing Prahasta's speech,
Vibhishana, seeking the welfare of the king, and having his intellect
grounded in virtue, interest and profit, said words enfolding high
sense,--"O Prahasta, like a sinful person being unable to ascend heaven,
what the king, Mahodara, thou, and Kumbhakarna, are saying with
reference to Rama, shall not prove true. As one without a raft cannot
cross over the mighty main, how can I, or thou, or all the Rakshas
combined, cause death unto Rama, who, O Prahasta, is versed in the sense
of things. Even the gods become stolid before the sovereign of the
Ikshwaku race, having righteousness for his principle quality, and being
a mighty car-warrior and of such a character, and who is competent in
action. As yet the Kanka-feathered, terrible and sharp shafts shot by
Raghava, have not pierced into thy body; and therefore thou dost speak
so. And, O Prahasta, as yet the sharpened shafts, capable of destroying
life and having the impetuosity of the thunder-bolt, have not entered
into thy body, and therefore thou dost speak thus, neither Ravana, nor
the exceedingly powerful Tricirsha. Neither Kumbhakarna's son Nikumbha
nor Indrajit, is capable of bearing in battle the son of Dacaratha,
resembling Sakra himself. And neither Devantaka[39] nor Narantaka,[40]
neither Atikaya,[41] nor the magnanimous Atiratha, nor the equally
strong Akampana, is competent to stay Raghava in fight. And the king,
naturally of fierce temper and thoughtless, through the instrumentality
of ye who appearing to be his friends are in reality his foes, seeketh
to destroy the Rakshasas. Do ye take out and deliver the monarch, who
hath through force become subject to a dreadful and mighty, and
thousand-headed serpent bursting with immeasurable prowess. As a person
possessed by fearfully strong ghosts, is saved by his friends pulling
him by his hair, attaining your desire ye should, assembling together,
rescue the king. This one is sunk in the Raghava sea having excellent
waters. Do ye speedily coming together deliver him. He (the king) hath
fallen into the Kakutstha nether regions, I tell thee my full
mind,--fraught with the welfare of this city together with the
Rakshasas, as well of the king with his adherents. Do thou make over
Maithili unto the son of the king. He is a true counsellor who adviseth
his master, after duly ascertaining the strength, position, increase or
destruction of the enemies as well as of their own party.

SECTION XV.


Hearing carefully the words of Bibhisana, gifted with the intelligence
of the lord of speech, the high-souled Indrajit, the leader of demons,
spake, saying,--"Why art thou, O uncle, speaking these useless words
like one terrified? He even, who is not born in this race, cannot speak
or act in this wise. Only one man in this family, my uncle Bibhisana, is
weak in energy, strength, prowess, patience, heroism and vigor. Why art
thou O timid one, afraid of them since any one of these Rakshasas is
capable of slaying those two princes, human beings as they are? The
master of the three worlds, the lord of the celestials, has been brought
down by me as captive on this earth. And all the celestials smitten with
fear fled to different quarters. I brought down on earth the
loud-roaring celestial elephant Airavata and uprooted by force its
tusks. And all the celestials were terrified at this. Am I not, who have
shattered the pride of the celestials, afflicted the leading Daityas,
and am gifted with excellent prowess, capable of discomfitting these two
princess--very ordinary mortals as they are?" Hearing the words of
(Indrajit) gifted with high energy, irrepressible and resembling the
lord of celestials, Bibhisana, the foremost of those using weapons,
addressed him with words, fraught with high import,--"O my son, thou art
a mere child and of unripe intellect and hence thou art not capable of
ascertaining the propriety and impropriety of counsels. Thou art
therefore speaking thus like a maniac for thy own destruction. Thou art
known as a son unto Ravana, O Indrajit, but in sooth, thou art his foe
in disguise, since knowing of his destruction from Raghava, thou dost
not prevent him. Thou art brave, childish and hast been impelled by thy
silly understanding. Thou shalt be slain along with him who hath brought
thee in this counsel chamber. Thou art, O Indrajit, foolish, imprudent,
devoid of humility, of an irritable temper, of feeble sense,
vicious-minded and of a silly understanding. And thou dost speak so,
being impelled by childishness. Who shall withstand in battle, the
shafts, shot by Raghava, resembling the rod of Death, the stick of
Brahman, flaming like the Fire of Dissolution. Do thou render back Sita,
king, unto Rama, with riches, jewels, excellent ornaments, clothes and
jems and we shall then be able to live here void of grief".



SECTION XVI.


Bibhishana addressing him with these excellent and auspicious words,
fraught with high sense, Ravana, impelled by Death, again spake in harsh
accents.--"It is better to live with open enemies or enraged serpents
than with those who pass for friends but are in reality foes. I know
well the nature of kinsmen, in all the worlds, O Rakhasa,--one takes
delight in another's misfortune. The kinsmen, O Rakshasa, generally
disregard him who is their king,[42] protecteth the kingdom, educated
and pious--and they always try to discomfit him, if he be a hero. These
terrible enemies--the kinsmen, hypocrite as they are, always take
delight in one another's calamity. Hear, I shall relate what the
elephants, in yore, spoke beholding some persons with noose in hand--"We
do not fear, fire, weapons, or even the terrible noose--we fear only the
dreadful kinsmen, blinded with selfishness. They alone unfold the means
of our destruction--there is not the least doubt about it. Fear from
kinsmen is therefore known as the worst of all fears. In kine there is
milk, in kinsmen, there is fear, in women there is fickleness, and in
Brahmanas, there is asceticism. It doth not please thee, I fancy, O
gentle one, that I am honored of the three worlds, the lord of riches,
and the subduer of my foes. As the drops of water do not last long on
the leaves of lotuses, so is the friendship with unworthy persons. As
the autumnal clouds, albeit muttering, do not pour forth water, so is
the friendship with unworthy persons. As a bee flies away after sucking
up the honey so is the friendship with unworthy persons. As a bee, after
feeding upon the Kaca flowers, doth not get honey so is (fruitless) the
friendship with unworthy persons. As an elephant, after being bathed,
covers its body again with dust, taking it with its trunk, so is the
friendship with unworthy persons.[43] Fie thee, O monkey, O thou that
bringest disgrace on the family. Had any one else spoken thus he would
have ceased to live by this time". Being thus accosted harshly,
Bibhisana, speaking truth, rose up along with four Rakshasas having
maces in their hands. Thereupon, rising up in the welkin, the graceful
brother Bibhisana, worked up with ire, addressed the lord of
Rakshasas--"Thou art mistaken, O king. Do thou speak what thou
wishest--thou art my elder brother, adorable like unto father--thou dost
not follow the track of virtue. I cannot tolerate the harsh accents of
thine, my elder brother.--For thy welfare I spoke those well-meaning
words, O Ten-necked one, but thou didst not pay heed to them being
brought under the control of Death. O king, many are the persons who
speak sweet words, but rare are they who can speak and hear unpalatable
but well-meaning words. How can I disregard thy death like unto a
burning house bound as thou art by the noose of Death, the destroyer of
all creatures. I do not wish to behold thee slain by the well-sharpened
shafts of Rama, feathered in gold and resembling the flaming fire. Even
the heroic and powerful persons, well versed in the use of weapons, wear
away like sands in battle, being attracted by Death. Thou art worshipful
unto me, do thou forgive me for what I have said for thy welfare. Do
thou protect thyself and this city, abounding in Rakshasas. May good
betide thee! I am going away and do thou be happy without me. What, I
spoke unto thee, O ranger of the night, to prevent thee, for thy
welfare, did not please thee. Persons, whose lease of life is well-nigh
expired, do not pay heed to the well-meaning words of their friends".

 [42] On account of the priority of his birth--T.

 [43] They afterwards forsake their former friends.--T.



SECTION XVII.


Having addressed Ravana with these harsh words, his younger brother,
reached in no time, where Rama along with Lakshmana was. The leading
monkeys, stationed on earth, espied him on the welkin, resembling in
size the summit of the mount Meru, and burning like lightning in the
effulgence of his own person. And his four attendants of terrible
prowess were adorned with excellent ornaments and armed with armours and
maces. He was like unto a collection of clouds, powerful as the
thunder-bolt, holding an excellent mace, heroic and embellished with
excellent ornaments. And beholding him along with four counsellors, the
highly intelligent Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, engaged in meditation
along with them. And meditating for a while, he spoke unto the monkeys
headed by Hanuman the following excellent words--"Behold, there comes a
Rakshasa, armed with various weapons and followed by four demons to slay
us and there is not the least doubt about it". And hearing the words of
Sugriva, the excellent monkeys, taking up huge trees and crags, bespoke
him,--"Do thou order us, O king, to destroy these vicious-souleri
demons. These shall crush them to death, limited as is the tenure of
their life". They addressing each other in this wise, Bibhisana
descended from the sky on the northern shore. And beholding Sugriva and
all others stationed near him, the highly intelligent Bibhisana accosted
them, at the highest pitch of his voice, saying,--"Liveth there the
Rakshasa, Ravana, the lord of demons, and perpetrator of many iniquitous
deeds. I am his younger brother known as Bibhisana. By him, slaying the
vulture Yatayu, was carried away Sita from Janasthana. She is
imprisoned, brought under his sway, poorly, and being well guarded by
the Rakshasees. With various well meaning words and reasonings I pointed
out unto him, the necessity of rendering back Sita unto Rama. And
Ravana, possessed by Death, paid no heed to my well-meaning words, like
unto one, lying on the brink of death, neglecting the administration of
medicine. Being reviled by him and treated harshly like a menial, I have
come to seek Raghava's shelter, renouncing my children and wives. Do ye
soon mention unto the high-souled Raghava, the refuge of all creatures,
that Bibhisana hath arrived". Hearing those words the quick-paced
Sugriva, excited with ire, spake unto Rama, before Lakshinana,
saying,--"Forsooth hath an enemy entered secretly in our midst and he
shall slay us getting an opportunity like unto an owl killing the crows.
O slayer of foes, it now behoveth thee to be particularly careful about
the counsels, arrangement of soldiers, polity--civil and military and
spies of our own party as well as those of the enemies. These Rakshasas
are heroic; they assume shapes at will, always lie in ambush and
secretly bring about others' ruin--we should not therefore place
confidence in them. This must be the emissary of Ravana--the lord of
Rakshasas. Entering in our midst, he shall, in sooth, sow dissensions in
our camp, or he shall slay us when we are careless, confiding in them.
Avoiding the enemies, we should now collect the forest-rangers our
friends and servants. O lord, this man is a Rakshasa by birth and the
brother of our foe and so is he our enemy, how can we trust him?
Ravana's younger brother, known as Bibhishana, hath come here with four
Rakshasas, to seek thy shelter. O thou the foremost of forgiving
persons, I consider this Bibhishana, who hath been despatched by Ravana,
worthy of being slain. Being impelled by his wicked intention and
commissioned by Ravana, this Rakshasa hath come here and secretly by
virtue of his illussive powers he shall slay thee, O innocent one, when
thou shalt place confidence in him". Having thus accosted Rama, skilled
in the art of speech, that lord of the army, Sugriva, well versed in
speech, became silent. And hearing the words of Sugriva, the mighty Rama
spake unto the monkeys, near him, headed by Hanuman, saying,--"Ye have
all heard, the words well grounded in reason, the lord of monkeys hath
said, regarding Ravana's younger brother. It behoveth him, who desireth
for perpetual wealth, and is intelligent and capable of giving sound
counsels, to advise his friends in difficult matters". Being thus
addressed by Rama (to minister unto him best counsels) all those
monkeys, intent upon encompassing his well-being, gave out their
respective opinions. "O Raghava, there is nothing beyond thy knowledge
in the three worlds. It is only to show thy respect towards us, O Rama,
that thou dost accost us in this wise. Thou art of truthful vows,
heroic, pious, of firm prowess, discriminating, recollecting and having
implicit confidence in thy friends. Let the intelligent and capable
counsellors deliver their reasonable opinions unto thee". They speaking
thus unto Raghava, the intelligent monkey Angada, spoke as follows for
sounding the intention of Bibhishana,--"We should always suspect him
since he has come from the side of our enemies, and should not, all on a
sudden, place confidence in him. The wicked-minded always move about
hiding their real self, and bring about peoples' calamity, taking
advantage of their weak points. And great is the disaster thereof. It is
always proper to engage in actions, considering what is right and what
is wrong. Virtues should always be gathered and vices abandoned. Do thou
renounce him unhesitatingly, if dost thou find in him a source of a
great calamity and do thou embrace him if dost thou find him crowned
with many virtues". Thereupon followed Sarava with words fraught with
high import,--"O best of men, do thou speedily despatch emissaries to
sound Bibhishana. If dost thou, sounding him well through the
instrumentality of sharp spies, find him friendly, do thou win him over
to thy side". Thereupon the wise Jambavan, arriving at conclusions by
virtue of his knowledge of _Sastras_, began with words, void of
defects,--"Surely doth Bibhishana come from the vicious lord of
Rakshasas, dead set against us and hath arrived at such a bad place and
in such a bad hour. We should always fear him". And thereupon followed
Mainda, conversant with what is right and wrong, after due deliberation,
with words pregnant with reason,--"He is Ravana's younger brother, by
name Bibhishana. Let the lord of men ask him every thing at first in
sweet words. Do thou first ascertain, O foremost of men, with what
intention he hath come--evil or good--and then settle what course to
adopt". Thereupon spake Hanuman, the foremost of the counsellors and
well versed in _Sastras_, in accents sweet, glorious and fraught with a
high value,--"Even Vrihaspati, (the lord of speech) cannot excell thee,
capable,[44] gifted with the best of intellect and foremost of those
skilled in the art of speech, as thou art. And what I know I speak, O
king. I do so, in the interest of Rama's work and not impelled by my
skill in the art of speech, by the pride of being a counsellor, by the
vanity of being gifted with a high intellect or by the desire of
speaking for its own sake. What thy counsellors have said for
ascertaining the good or evil intention of Bibhishana appeareth to me as
most defective and productive of no consequence whatever. It is
impossible to sound him without any command.[45] And even to command him
now for the same appears to me as improper. And as regards the despatch
of spies, anent what thou hast been advised by thy ministers, I do not
observe any utility. And what little I have thought of, I have something
to say (regarding Jambavan's proposal) that Bibhishana hath arrived at
such a bad place and in such an evil hour. He has really come to a very
good place and in a very good hour. And truly has he performed a
becoming and sensible action by coming here after duly ascertaining that
Ravana is a vicious wight and thou art a pious person--he is full of
vices--thou art gifted with many virtues--he is tyrranical and thou art
powerful. And what they hate said, O king, as regards sounding him
through secret spies, appears to me as one requiring great wisdom. An
intelligent man, when questioned by any suddenly, suspects many things.
And if the new-comer be a friend and has come here for his own
happiness, how greatly shall his mind be changed by such a course?
Besides by a sudden questioning it is impossible to ascertain the
intention of a foreigner. Do thou therefore thyself accost him and
determine, by his voice, his secret motive. I did not however mark
anything of his wickedness while he spoke; rather I did observe signs of
gladness on his countenance. So I do not suspect him. The wily can never
come fearless and undisturbed. Nor were his words cunning. So I do not
suspect him. It is not very easy to hide one's real nature. It manifests
itself by force. So this action of Bibhishana is not out of place or
season. When accomplished it shall redound to his own interest.
Considering well thy preparations for war and Ravana's vain conduct,
hearing of Vali's destruction and Sugriva's installation on the throne,
he hath, impelled by his good sense, come here, desirous of gaining the
kingdom. Taking these into account, it seems prudent to take him to our
side. O thou the foremost of the intelligent, I have spoken thus
considering him sincere. It now behoveth thee to perform what thou
thinkest proper".

SECTION XVIII.


Hearing those words of the Wind-god's son, the irrepressible Rama,
conversant with all the Sastras, replied, with words expressing his own
opinion--"I have also thought of some thing regarding Bibhishana. I wish
you all, interested in my well-being, to hear that. (Bibhishana) hath
come here as a friend so I cannot forsake him by any means. And even if
he has come with any evil intent it is not culpable for the pious to
afford him shelter". Thereupon hearing his words and considering them
well, Sugriva, the lord of the monkeys, replied in more auspicious[46]
words,--"Whether this ranger of the night is sincere or wicked, he
should never be offered any shelter, since he hath forsaken his brother
in the midst of these calamities. What reason is there to believe that
he shall not renounce us in our difficulty?" Hearing the words of the
lord of monkeys and casting his looks towards them, Kakutstha, having
truth for his prowess, smiling a little, spake, unto Lakshmana, crowned
with all the marks of piety, saying--"Without being conversant with
_Sastras_, and living in the company of old men, none can speak such
words as have been uttered by the king of the monkeys. There appear unto
me, however two subtler reasons anent the difference between brothers,
amongst the kings--one is evident and another mundane. There are two
classes of foes--one consisting of the members of the same line the
other of the neighbours. And these generally bring about our misfortune
whenever any opportunity presents itself. And it is for this that he
hath come here. Those kinsmen, who do not think of one another's
mischief, generally long for their respective well-being. But even such
well-meaning relatives are feared by the kings. And hear, I shall
relate, what the _Sastras_ say regarding the weak points thou hast
mentioned as to the advisability of taking the enemies to our side. We
are not his kinsmen and this Rakshasa hath come here with a view to gain
the kingdom. Even the Rakshasas are wise enough to ascertain the proper
course--so we must take Bibhishana. If the brothers are confident and
satisfied with each other they generally live together, or else they
fear each other and ultimately engage in a tumultuous war. And there
hath sprung up some difference with Ravana and therefore Bibhishana hath
come here. Nor are, O friend, all brothers like Bharata, all sons like
me unto their father, all friends like thee". Being thus addressed by
Rama, the highly wise Sugriva, along with Lakshmana, rose up and bending
low his head, said--"O thou the best of all forgiving persons, this
night-ranger hath been despatched by Ravana. I therefore think it better
to kill him. Being impelled by his vicious sense that Rakshasa hath come
here to slay us, O innocent one, when myself, thou and Lakshmana shall
consider ourselves secure. Therefore the large-armed Bibhisana, the
younger brother of the ruthless Ravana, deserves to be slain along with
his counsellors". Having thus addressed (Rama) the foremost of Raghu's
race, skilled in art of speech, Sugriva, the lord of monkey host,
equally versed in the art of speech, became silent. And hearing the
words of Sugriva, and weighing them, Rama again addressed the foremost
of monkeys with more reasonable accents--"Wicked or otherwise, whatever
this night-ranger may be, he shall not be able to do me the least
mischief. Pisachas, Danavas, Yakshas or all the Rakshasas on earth,--I
can slay them all, if I like, with the tips of my fingers, O thou the
lord of monkeys. I have heard of a pigeon adoring and entertaining with
its own flesh, an enemy who took its shelter. While a pigeon received so
friendly its enemy, the slayer of its mate, how can I then act
otherwise, O foremost of the monkeys? Do thou hear, I shall relate, a
sacred story, narrated by the great ascetic, the truthful Kandu, son of
the ascetic Kanya. O slayer of foes, even a wicked-minded enemy, if he,
with folded palms and a poor heart, craveth for thy shelter, should not
be slain. If an enemy, proud or terrified, seeketh shelter in affright,
he should be saved by a great man even at the risk of his own life. One,
who from fear, ignorance or wilfully doth not protect him who seeketh
his shelter, perpetrateth a mighty iniquity, blamed of all. When a
person is slain before him whose shelter he hath taken he taketh away
all the virtues of his protector. So great is the sin in not affording
shelter unto those who seek for it; it standeth in the way of going to
heaven, bringeth in calumny and destroyeth the strength and prowess. I
shall therefore follow the excellent words of Kandu--leading to piety,
fame and the attainment of the abode of the celestials. I always declare
'no fear' unto all creatures, whenever any, approaching me, says, 'I am
thine' and seeketh my shelter. Even this is my pious observance. O
Sugriva, O foremost of monkeys, do thou soon bring him here, whether he
be Ravana or Bibhishana and I shall declare unto him 'no fear'. Hearing
the words of Rama, Sugriva, the lords of those who go bounding,
over-flowing with friendliness, bespake Kakutstha.--"What wonder is
there that thou wouldst speak these auspicious words, O thou the
foremost of kings, conversant with morality, gifted with prowess and
ever treading the pious track as thou art. Truly doth my inner self
regard Bibhisana as devoid of any wicked intention. He has been well
sounded by signs and gestures. And let the greatly wise Bibhisana,
Raghava, be placed on an equal footing with us and gain our friendship".
Hearing the words of Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, the king of men
(Rama) made instantly friends with Bibhisana, like unto the conqueror of
enemies' cities making friends with the king of birds.

 [46] More reasonable words.--T.



SECTION XIX.


Raghava thus declaring unto him 'no fear', Ravana's younger brother, the
greatly wise Bibhisana, bending low his head, cast his looks on the
earth. And descending from the welkin with his devoted attendants the
virtuous-souled Bibhisana, delighted, bowed unto Rama. And thereupon
touching his feet along with four Rakshasas, Bibhisana addressed
Rama,--with words, fraught with piety, befitting the occasion and
conducing to pleasure. "I am Ravana's younger brother and have been
greatly insulted by him, I have therefore come to seek thy shelter, the
refuge of all creatures, abandoning Lanka, and renouncing my friends and
riches. My kingdom, life and happiness are all at thy disposal". Hearing
his words Rama replied,--comforting him with words and favouring him as
if with looks. "Do thou relate unto me truly the strength and weakness
of the enemies". Being thus accosted by Rama of unwearied actions, the
Raksha, began to describe the strength of Ravana. "O prince, by virtue
of the boon acquired from the Self-Create, the Ten-necked one is
incapable of being slain by all creatures--Gandharbas, serpents, or
birds. My elder brother--the one next to Ravana--is the heroic and
highly effulgent _Kumbharkarna_--Sakra's equal in battle. Thou mayst
have heard, O Rama, his commander is Prahasta, by whom was defeated
Manibhadra on the mount Kailaca. (His son) Indrajit, equipped with
invincible armour, bow and finger-protector made of the skin of iguana,
becomes invisible in fight. And, worshipping Fire and becoming
invisible, that graceful hero, O Raghava, slayeth the enemies in
conflict, having the contending parties vast and well arranged.
Mahodara, Mahaparcwa and the Rakshasa, Akampana, are his lieutenants,
who equal the Lokapalas[47] in battle. His army consists of ten thousand
_kotis_ of Rakshasas, wearing shapes at will, inhabiting the city of
Lanka, and living on flesh and gore. And with the _Lokapalas_ and the
celestials, they were all defeated by the vicious-souled Ravana".
Hearing the words of Bibhisana and weighing them in his mind, that
foremost of Raghu's race said--"I understand well the strength and
prowess of Ravana, which thou hast depicted truly, O Bibhisana. Do thou
hear truly that I shall slay the Ten-necked one together with Prahasta
and his sons, and I shall make thee king. Whether he entereth the
_Rasatala_[48] or the regions under the earth, or seeketh shelter of the
Grand-father of the celestials, he shall not be able to save his life
from me. I do swear by my three brethern that I shall enter the city of
Ayodhya, after slaying in battle Ravana with his sons, kinsmen and
friends". Hearing these words of Rama of unwearied action, the
virtuous-souled (Bibhisana), bowing his head unto him, began--"I shall
lend thee my might in slaying the Rakshasas and devastating the city of
Lanka, and shall be in the midst of Ravana's army". Thereupon, embracing
Bibhisana, who spoke thus, Rama, delighted, said unto Lakshmana,--"O my
brother, do thou bring water from the ocean. Sprinkling the greatly wise
Bibhisana, I shall make him at once the king of the Rakshasas, O
conferer of honor; for I am greatly pleased with him". Being thus
addressed, Saumitri, at the command of the king, annointed Bibhisana and
made him the king of the Rakshasas in the presence of the monkey-host.
Beholding Rama's kindness (towards Bibhisana), the monkeys eulogized the
high-souled one, exclaiming "Excellent! Excellent!" Thereupon, Hanuman
and Sugriva addressed Bibhisana, saying, "Do thou tell us how we shall
cross over the main--the abode of Varuna, along with the host of the
highly powerful monkeys. Do thou inform us of the means by which we may
cross over, along with our army, the lord of rivers and streams--the
abode of Varuna". Being thus addressed, the virtuous-souled Bibhisana
replied,--"It behoveth the king, Raghava, to seek refuge from the Ocean.
This measureless deep was dug out by (the king) Sagara.[49] And the
great Ocean shall surely help Rama belonging to Sagara's race". Being
thus accosted by the wise Rakshasa, Bibhishana. Sugriva reached where
Rama with Lakshmana was. Thereupon, the broad-necked Sugriva began to
explain the well-meaning words of Bibhishana, requesting Rama to seek
the shelter of the Ocean. And those words pleased Rama, pious by nature.
And the highly eflulgent (hero) requested, smiling, the active Lakshmana
and the monkey-chief Sugriva to collect necessaries for his adoration.
"O Lakshmana, this counsel of Bibhisana appeareth to me as most sound.
Sugriva is always greatly wise, and thou art greatly proficient in
counsel. Do ye, holding a conference, intimate to me what you think
becoming". Thus addressed, those two heroes--Lakshmana and Sugriva,
spoke respectfully the following words fraught with propriety,--"Why
shall not the well-meaning words of Bibhisana expressed now, please us,
O Raghava, O thou best of men? Without constructing a bridge over the
deep, the terrible abode of Varuna, even the celestials and their lord
(Indra) cannot get at the city of Lanka. Do thou act on the genuine
counsel of the heroic Bibhisana, and without losing time, do thou engage
the Ocean for this work, so that we may with our army proceed to the
city of Ravana". Being thus addressed Rama reached the shore of the lord
of rivers and streams, covered with Kuca, like unto fire getting into
the sacrificial dais.

SECTION XX.


Thereupon the greatly powerful Rakshasa, by name _Sardula_, beheld the
army of Sugriva arranged on the shore of the ocean. And, beholding the
army all busy, the emissary of the vicious-souled Rakshasa--Ravana,
entered the city of Lanka and, approaching his lord, said,--"The army of
monkeys and bears hath approached Lanka. It is immeasurably deep as the
ocean. And those two sons of the king Dacaratha--the brothers Rama and
Lakshmana, gifted with great beauty, coming to rescue Sita, have
stationed themselves on the shore of the ocean, O thou of great
effulgence. The army of Rama extends over the sky and ten _yojanas_. I
have come, O great king, to acquaint thee with the real truth. And,
knowing everything, it behoveth thy emissaries, O king, to settle
whether to render back Sita, to adopt measures of conciliation, or to
sow dissensions in the enemy's camp". Hearing the words of _Sardula_,
Ravana, the lord of Rakshasas, being anxious to ascertain his duty,
addressed a Rakshasa by name Suka, the most sensible of his counsellors,
with the following pregnant words,--"Do thou go and communicate unto
king Sugriva my behest, in becoming and excellent accents. 'Thou art
born of a great family and art the mighty son of the king of bears. I
have no dissension with thee. In fact I consider thee as my brother, O
king of monkeys. Though I have stolen the spouse of the high-souled
prince (Rama), yet what is that to thee, O Sugriva? Do thou return to
Kishkindha. The monkeys shall not by any means be able to attack the
city of Lanka. Even the celestials and Gandharbas could not--what of
these men and monkeys?'" And being thus commissioned by the lord of
Rakshasas, that night-ranger assumed the shape of a bird and, bounding,
speedily reached the sky. And, proceeding far over the deep and
stationing himself at the welkin, he spoke unto Sugriva all the words
with which he was addressed by the vicious-souled Ravana. Hearing him
speak thus, the monkeys leaped up quickly and reached there with a view
to chop off his wings or to slay him with their clenched fists. On being
seized vehemently by all these monkeys, that night-ranger was brought
down speedily from the sky to the earth. And being assailed by the
monkeys, Suka said,--"O Kakutstha, it doth not behove (people) to slay
an emissary. Do thou therefore prevent the monkeys. He who passing by
his master's behest, giveth out his own intention, is not faithful; and
he therefore deserveth to be slain". Hearing the piteous accents of
Suka, Rama spake unto the monkeys, who were about to kill him, saying,
"Do not kill him". And again stationing himself on the welkin, that
night-ranger said,--"O Sugriva, O thou gifted with great energy, O thou
of great prowess, what shall I speak unto Ravana, dreaded by all
people?" Being thus addressed, that mighty king of monkeys, the bull
among them, of unwearied energy, spake unto that emissary--the
night-ranger, Suka, saying--"O Ravana, thou art not my friend or an
object of pity. Thou art not my benefactor, nor art liked by me. Thou
art Rama's enemy, and thou dost therefore deserve to be slain by him
like Vali along with thy friends and relatives. I shall therefore slay
thee, O king of night-rangers, together with thy sons, friends and
relatives. And I shall have the whole city of Lanka reduced to ashes by
my mighty force. Thou shalt not be able to escape Raghava, O Ravana, O
thou who hast lost thy sense, even if thou art protected by the
celestials. And thou shalt with thy brother be slain by Rama, even if
thou dost fly into the sky, enter into the regions under the earth, or
seek shelter of Mahadeva. I do not behold any in these three
worlds--Pisacha, Rakshasa, Gandharba, or Asura, who can protect thee.
Thou hast slain the monarch of vultures, who had grown decrepit through
age.[50] Thou hast carried off the large-eyed Sita from the vicinity of
Rama and the neighbourhood of Lakshmana; but, having captured her, thou
understandest not (thy native strength). Nor dost thou understand that
foremost of Raghus, high-souled, possessed of great strength, and
incapable of being repressed even by the celestials,--who shall take thy
life". Then spake that best of monkeys, Angada, son of Vali,--"O highly
wise one, this is no emissary. This one clearly appeareth to me as a
spy. He hath come to form an estimate of thy entire army. Take him. Let
him not go (back) to Lanka. This is indeed what I would". Thereat,
commanded by the king, the monkeys, springing up, seized (Suka) and
bound him, as he burst out bewailing like one forlorn. On being sorely
handled by the relentless monkeys, Suka cried unto tho high-souled Rama,
son of Dacaratha,--"They by main force sever my wings, and they pierce
my eyes. If I lose my life, may all the evil deeds that I have committed
between the night when I was born and the night when I shall die, be
thine!" Hearing this pitiful cry, Rama prevented (the monkeys); and he
said unto them,--"Let go this envoy, who hath come here".

 [50] The commentator has a queer and characteristic note on
      _Jaravriddha--decrepit through age. One that is old, may stave off
      decrepitude through some drug, while a youthful person may come by
      the same in consequence of some curse.--T._



SECTION XXI.


Then on the shore of the sea, Raghava, spreading _darbha_, with his
hands joined towards the great deep, laid him down, with his face to the
East. And that slayer of foes (lay down), making his pillow his arm
resembling the shining form of a serpent; always dight with golden
ornaments; full many a time pressed with the palms of beauteous
damsels,[51] decked with jewelled golden _Keyuras_ and superb ornaments
studded with pearls; smeared from above with sandal and _aguru_; (his
arm) which formerly had been graced in bed with the head of Sita; like
unto the body of Takshaka under the waters of the Ganga; resembling a
yoke; in battle increasing the sorrow of foes and enhancing for long the
delight of friends;--his left arm having its skin destroyed by the
strokes of the bow-string; which was the refuge of the entire
earth;--his right arm resembling a mighty bludgeon,--the donor of
thousands of kine,--making this great arm his pillow (he laid him down).
"To-day either I shall die, or shall the Ocean".--Having thus formed his
resolution in respect of the great deep, Rama, restraining his speech,
with a concentrated mind lay down there agreeably to rule. And as Rama
slept on the earth on Kuca spread over, without ever swerving from the
rule, three nights passed away. And while spending three nights, Rama,
learned in polity and attached to virtue, prayed unto that lord of
streams--the Ocean. Yet the wicked Ocean, albeit adored according to his
deserts by Rama with his mind concentrated, did not show himself.
Thereat Rama grew enraged and had the corners of his eyes crimsoned; and
he spake unto Lakshmana of auspicious marks, saying,--"Behold the
hauteur of the Ocean in not presenting himself before me. Calmness,
forbearance, candour, and soft speech--these virtues of the good are by
the insolent taken for the effects of incompetency. The person[52] that
is self-laudatory, wicked, and badly-bold, publisheth his own praise,
and meteth out chastisement every where,[53] is honored in the world. By
moderation one cannot attain celebrity, by moderation one cannot attain
fame,--and, O Lakshmana, in this world by moderation one cannot attain
victory on 'the edge of battle.'[54] See, O Sumitra's son, the abode of
Makaras, with his waters obstructed all around with Makaras destroyed by
my shafts. And, O Lakshmana, see the bodies here of serpents, and the
huge bodies of mighty fishes, and the trunks of elephants,--torn by my
arrows. And to-day in terrible battle will I dry up the Ocean with
conchs and oysters, and fishes and Makaras. This abode of Makaras taketh
me, who is forbearing, to be incompetent. Fie on forbearance towards
such as he! In consequence of my moderation, Ocean showeth not his own
form. O Saumitri, bring thou my bow, my arrows resembling venomous
snakes. I will dry up the Ocean, and the monkeys shall go over on foot.
And, being angered, to-day, albeit incapable of being agitated, will I
agitate the deep. And by means of my shafts will I make Varuna's abode,
surging with a thousand billows and having his dignity maintained by his
shores,--overleap his continents. And I will agitate the deep harbouring
numbers of mighty Danavas". Having spoken thus, Rama, equipped with his
bow, with his eyes dilated in wrath, became exceedingly irrepressible,
like unto the flaming fire at the final dissolution. And straining his
dreadful bow, making the earth shake, tremulously, he let fly fierce
shafts like him of an hundred sacrifices hurling his thunder-bolt.
Thereat, flaming up, those vehement choice shafts surcharged with
energy, enter into the waters of the sea, with its serpents afflicted
with fear. And then great and exceedingly dreadful was the motion of the
sea, with fishes and Makaras, and with the roar of the winds (blowing
there). And on a sudden the mighty deep was heaving with mighty surges,
with conchs scattered about, and a smoke (enveloped) the ocean; and the
billows became visible on all sides. And the serpents were distressed,
with their faces flaming and their eyes aglow; as well as the Danavas of
terrific energy, and the dwellers of the nether spheres. And billows of
the sovran Ocean, resembling Vindhya or Mandara, containing crocodiles
and Makaras sprang up by thousands. And Varuna's abode had its surges
whirling, its serpents and Rakshasas seized with affright, and its
ferocious aquatic animals borne all around; and it sent forth sounds.
Then Sumitra's son, springing up, said unto Raghava of fiery vehemence,
as he sighed and kept stretching his matchless bow.--"This must not be".
And he took away his (Rama's) bow. "Without doing this unto the Ocean,
thou, supreme of heroes, mayst have thy work accomplished. Personages
like thee do not come under the influence of passion. Do thou
deliberately look about for some worthy means (for compassing thy end)".
Then remaining invisible in the sky, Brahmarshis and Surarshis[55]
exclaiming,--"Well-a-day!" and "Don't," in loud accents
ejaculated,--(Oh! and alas!)

 [51] The commentator appropriately remarks: _As Rama was wedded to a

SECTION XXII.


Then the foremost of Raghus addressed Ocean in stern words,
saying,--"To-day will I dry up the Ocean along with the nether regions.
And, O Ocean, thy waters being burnt up by my shafts, and thou being
dried up, with thy (aquatic) animals slaughtered, a mighty volume of
dust shall arise (from thy bed). And, O Ocean, in consequence of the
arrowy shower discharged from my bow, the monkeys shall go over to the
further shore on foot. Having attained dimensions in consequence of
access of waters, thou knowest not my manliness or my prowess But, O
abode of Danavas, grief shalt thou reap at my hands". Then fixing an
arrow resembling the rod of Brahma with a Brahma Mantra, on the best of
bows, that exceedingly strong one drew it. And as Raghava suddenly
stretched his bow, heaven and earth seemed to be riven, and the
mountains trembled. And darkness covered the world, and the cardinal
points became invisible. And at once the watery expanses and rivers were
agitated. And the stars appeared simultaneously with the Sun and
Moon.[56] And the sky was illumined with the rays of the Sun, and yet it
was overspread with darkness; and it burned with an hundred meteors. And
thunder-bolts sending forth sounds surpassing all others, dropped from
the firmament. And the winds began to blow violently; breaking down
trees and momentarily scattering clouds; damaging mountain-tops and
shattering summits. And then the dread and mighty thunders possessing
impetuous speed and emitting tremendous roars,--coming together,
produced lightning flashes. And those creatures that could be seen,
uttered sounds resembling the thunder; and those that were invisible
gave forth frightful cries. And overwhelmed with fright, and quaking
(for fear), the creatures began to measure their lengths,--and they were
sore afflicted, and bereft of motion through terror. And then the mighty
deep with its animals, and with its waters and waves, and with its
serpents and Rakshasas, was suddenly wrought up with a violent motion.
And albeit it was not the occasion of the universal dissolution, the
Ocean passed beyond his shores for a full hundred _yojanas_. And seeing
the elated Ocean--lord of streams and rivers--thus overpass his bounds,
that destroyer of enemies, Raghu's son, Rama, was not moved.[57] Then
from forth the mid-sea arose Ocean himself, even as the maker of day
riseth from the mighty ascending-hill, Meru. And accompanied by
Pannagas[58] of flaming faces, the Ocean showed himself, appearing like
cool lapises, adorned with golden ornaments,--wearing a wreath of gems
and a jewelled vesture, with his eyes resembling lotus-leaves, bearing
on his head a noble garland containing all flowers; decked with
ornaments of polished gold; as well with excellent ornaments of gems
originating in himself, like the mountain Himavan embellished with
metals (sprung in himself),--(the Ocean arose) with wave on wave
whirling around, and rife with winds blowing among clouds,--surrounded
by streams, Ganga, Sindhu (and others). And approaching the
arrow-showering Rama, and greeting him fair, Ocean spoke unto him with
joined hands,--"O Raghava, earth, air, sky, water and light,--these, O
mild one, retaining their eternal course, maintain their (respective)
natures. Mine also is that nature whereby I am fathomless and incapable
of being crossed. The reverse of this is the having a bottom. And for
this reason I speak to thee (concerning the means). O king's son, not
from desire, or covetuousness, or fear, or anger, can I anywise deprive
my waters abounding in alligators of their (perpetual) motion. I will
tell thee how thou wilt pass (over me); and I will bear it. And no
ferocious aquatic animals shall do wrong so long as thy forces have not
crossed. And, O Rama, I will make as it were firm land for the crossing
over of the monkeys". Then Rama said,--"O Varuna's abode, listen to me!
This arrow (of mine) must accomplish the end (intended). Where shall I
let it light?" Hearing Rama's speech, and looking at the mighty arrow,
that exceedingly energetic one, the great Deep, addressed Raghava,
saying,--"There is a certain spot of mine in the North, which is more
sacred (than the rest). It is famed as Drumakulya, even as thou art
famed in the world. There are there many robbers of ferocious forms and
actions,--wicked wights, headed by cow-herds,--who drink of my water.
These persons of unrighteous acts touch me, and I cannot bear this sin.
O Rama, do thou at that place render this best of arrows successful".
Hearing the words of the high-souled Ocean, (Rama) immediately
after,[59] let fly that flaming shaft. And the place where the arrow
resembling the thunder-bolt and _vajra_ in splendour, alighted, hath
been celebrated on earth as Marukantara. And hurt with the dart, the
Earth emitted roars; and in consequence of this, water began to gush out
at the mouth of the wound from the subterranean regions. And this then
became well-known as Vrana; and there are seen the waters of the Ocean
spring up. And there arose a terrific report of riving. And owing to
this,[60] as well as the incident of the arrow, the water that existed
in the tanks, was dried up. Having dried up Marukantara famous
throughout the three regions, as well as the reservoirs of water, Rama
the son of Dacaratha, learned and of god-like prowess, conferred a boon
on the desert, saying,--"This place shall be filled with food nourishing
beasts; and ailments shall be rare here. And the fruits and roots shall
be replete with relish; and it shall abound in oil and overflow with
milk; and it shall contain various odorous drugs". Thus did the desert
come to possess these attributes; and from Rama's bestowal of a boon, it
attained a pleasant aspect. On that place being burnt up, that lord of
streams, the Ocean, thus spake unto Raghava, versed in every branch of
learning,--"O mild one, this one is named Nala, son unto Vicwakarma. He
hath received a boon from his sire. Vicwakarma's son is well pleased
with thee. Let this monkey, surcharged with exhuberant spirits, build a
bridge over me. I will hold that up. This one is as his sire". Having
delivered himself thus, Ocean disappeared. Then that foremost of
monkeys, Nala, arising, spoke unto the mighty Rama,--"Resorting to my
sire's skill, I will build a bridge over the spacious abode of Makaras.
The mighty Ocean hath spoken justly. In respect of the ingrate even
chastisement is supreme in this world,--this is my conviction. Down with
forbearance, or moderation, or gift! This dreadful Ocean, this mighty
deep, expecting to see a bridge (thrown over him), hath granted depth
unto Raghava.--(Formerly) is Mandara, Vicwakarma had conferred a boon on
my mother: 'O exalted one, thy son shall be like me.' I am a son of his,
sprung from his loins, and I am like unto Vicwakarma. Not having been
asked by thee, I had not unfolded my qualifications. I also am capable
of constructing a bridge over Varuna's abode. Therefore this very day
let the foremost monkeys construct the bridge". Then directed by Rama,
the principal monkeys with alacrity entered the mighty forest in
hundrerds and thousands. And themselves resembling mountains, the
foremost of the monkeys began to break down and draw them towards the
Ocean. And the monkeys filled the Ocean with _salas_, and _acwakarnas_,
_dhavas_, bamboos _kutajas_, _arjunas_, palms, _tilakas_, _tinicas_,
_billakas_, _aparnas_, and blossoming _karnikaras_, mangoes, and a
trees. And those monkeys--the foremost of their species--began to gather
the trees, some with their roots, some without them,--carrying them like
Indra's ensign. And those huge-bodied monkeys possessed of prodigious
strength, procured palms and pomegranates, cocoanuts and itakas,
Kariras, Vakulas, and Nimbas,--as well as rocks. Measuring elephants'
dimensions; and uprooting crags, they tossed them by means of machines.
And on rocks being plunged into the waters, the latter, suddenly
swelling up, mounted to the welkin, and again subsided.--And (the trees)
dropping (into the deep), vexed it all around. And some made lines (for
insuring straightness unto the bridge). And in the middle of the lord of
rivers and streams, Nala made a grand bridge measuring an hundred
_yojanas_. And then he went about constructing the bridge with the
assistance of monkeys of dreadful deeds. And some took the measuring and
others bore (timber to the sea). And by help of hundreds of monkeys
following Rama's mandate, hued like woods or mountains, (they)
constructed a bridge with grass, and wood. And the monkeys made the
bridge of trees with blossoming tops. And (monkeys) resembling Danavas
were rushing all around with rocks resembling hills, and
mountain-summits. And tremendous was the tumult that came of crags
thrown and rocks toppled down into the mighty deep. And on the first day
the elephant-like monkeys of spirits and exerting themselves vigorously,
finished fifteen _yojanas_. And the exceedingly strong and huge-bodied
monkeys on the second day speedily disposed of twenty _yojanas_. And on
the third day the huge-bodied active monkeys did one and twenty
_yojanas_ on the sea. And on the fourth day the exceedingly impetuous
monkeys, bestirring themselves vigorously, did two and twenty _yojanas_.
And On the fifth day the fast-speeding monkeys accomplished three and
twenty _yojanas_ reaching unto the fair shore. And resembling his sire,
that best of monkeys, the lusty and graceful offspring of Vicwakarma,
(thus) constructed the bridge over the sea. And that bridge built by
force over the abode of _makaras_, looked graceful and splendid like the
Milky way in the firmament. And then the deities and Gandharbas, the
Siddhas and the prime saints, appearing in the heavens, stood there,
eager to behold this wonder. And the gods and Gandharbas saw that bridge
of Nala, difficult of being made, having an area of ten _yojanas_ and
measuring an hundred in length. And the monkeys, leaping and bounding
and roaring, as well as all creatures, beheld that building of the
bridge on the ocean, inconceivable, and marvellous, displaying skill
past thought and capable of making one's hair stand on end. And those
thousands of Kotis of exceeding vigor, having constructed the bridge
over the ocean, went over to the other shore of the mighty main. And
spacious, skillfully constructed, graceful, well-paved and nicely
finished, the great bridge appeared like the line where the hair hath
been parted on the Ocean's head. Then on the other shore of the ocean,
Bibhishana, with the view of opposing foes (that might advance),
stationed himself mace in hand, along with some councilors. Then Sugriva
spoke unto Rama, having truth for his prowess,--"Do thou get upon
Hanuman, and let Laskhmana get upon Angada. O hero, vast is this
Ocean--abode of Makaras. These monkeys, rangers of the sky, shall hold
you up both". Thereat the graceful and righteous Rama along with
Lakshmana, equipped with his bow, set out in the van of the army in
company with Sugriva. And some monkeys proceeded along the middle, and
some plunged into the deep, and some went by the road. And some coursed
through the air, bounding up bird-like. And that dreadful array of
monkeys crossing over, with its mighty uproar drowned the dreadful roar
of the deep, which had been arising. On the monkey-host having crossed
by the bridge of Nala, the king stationed it on the shore abounding in
fruits, roots and water. Beholding that work of Raghava incapable of
being performed, the deities together with the Siddhas and Charanas, and
the Maharshis, suddenly presenting themselves before Rama, sprinkled him
one by one with sacred water, and said,--"Mayst thou be victorious, O
human-divine one! Rule thou the Earth eternally!" Thus in various
auspicious words, did they pay homage unto that one honored by the
Brahmanas, Rama.

 [56] The phenomenon, remarks the commentator, was owing to the heavenly
      bodies obstructing each other's orbit.--T.

SECTION XXIII.


Having seen omens, that one, Lakshmana's elder brother, conversant with
them, embracing the son of Sumitra, said these words,--"O Lakshmana,
occupying (this tract) of cool waters and woods affluent with fruits,
will we, dividing and arranging our forces, stay here. Mighty is the
fear that I see at hand,--boding destruction to people and the slaughter
of the foremost heroes of bears, monkeys and Rakshasas. The wind bloweth
darkly, and the Earth shaketh. The tops of the mountains tremble, and
trees topple down. And the clouds are ashen and roistering, and roar
roughly. And lowering, they shower portentous drops of blood. And the
twilight is terrible and looketh like the red sandal. And a fiery circle
droppeth from the flaming sun. And on all sides birds and beasts,
distressed, uttering woe-begone notes, and grim-visaged, set up crying
against the sun, arousing great fear. And the Moon, although not
appearing[61] in the night, burneth, and with dark and red rays riseth,
as if it intended to exterminate people. And the aspect (of the sun) is
slight, rough, and not good;[62] and, O Lakshmana, a blue mark is
visible on the unclouded Sun. And the stars seem erased by a mighty
volume of dust. O Lakshmana, behold this sight disastrous to people like
unto the universal dissolution. Crows, and hawks, and the inferior
vultures, wheel all round. And jackals are sending inauspicious yells,
exciting great fear. The earth shall be covered with darts and javelins,
and swords discharged by monkeys and Rakshasas, and then turned into
mire with flesh and gore. Surrounded by all these monkeys, will we,
using speed, this very day rapidly enter into the city ruled by Ravana,
incapable of being subdued. Having said this, that subduer in conflict,
that lord, the enchanter of men, Rama,[63] equipped with his bow,
proceeds in the direction of Lanka. And all the principal monkeys--
Sugriva with Bibhishana--went on, setting up roars, for the destruction
of foes, who were determined to battle with them. And consequently
Raghu's son was well pleased with the fortitude and exertions of the
powerful monkeys, for bringing about what was dear unto Raghava.

 [61] The moon, it seems, _doth_ appear, but does not look out
      clearly.--T.

 [62] _Pracasta_--I do not see the propriety of this epithet in this
      connection. This may be a mistake.--T.

 [63] The word _Rama_ occurs twice, one being the cognomen of the solar
      line. The other means, _the enchanter of men.--T._



SECTION XXIV.


And with the presence of the king[64] that assembly of heroes looked
beautiful, as doth the autumnal night, garnished with beauteous stars,
with the Moon. And oppressed with the bursting energy of the host
resembling the ocean, the Earth trembled. And then the rangers of the
forest heard a hubbub in Lanka, as well as the sounds of trumpets and
Mridangas, mighty and capable of making people's down stand on end. And
at those sounds, the leaders of monkey-bands were delighted beyond
measure, and, resenting the same, set up cries louder than those sounds.
And the Rakshasas also heard the roars of the monkeys, resembling the
rumbling of haughty clouds in the sky. Beholding Lanka with variegated
standards, and streamers, Dacaratha's son went[65] to Sita with an
aggrieved heart. "Here that one having eyes resembling those of a young
deer, is confined by Ravana, like unto Rohini overpowered by the
red-bodied planet".[66] And, sighing hot and long, and looking at
Lakshmana, that hero spoke words fraught with his good at that
time--"Behold, O Lakshmana, Lanka towering up as if piercing the
heavens; and, built by Vicwakarma on the brow of the mountain, she seems
to have been made by the Mind. Constructed in time past with edifices
thronging her, Lanka looks like the all-encasing air, covered with pale
clouds. Lanka is embellished with groves resembling Chitraratha, fair,
and eloquent with the notes of various birds, and fraught with fruits
and flowers. Behold the intoxicated birds, and the black bees blending
(with the blossoms). And the blessed breeze swayeth the trees vocal with
the coels". Having divided his forces there agreeably to the directions
of the scriptures, Dacaratha's son, Rama, thus spoke unto Lakshmana. And
he ordered that monkey-army, saying,--"Taking his own forces, let the
puissant and invincible Angada along with Nila, station himself in the
centre of the forces. And let the monkey, named Rishabha, surrounded by
numbers of monkeys, post himself at the right of the monkey-army. And
let the active and irrepressible Gandhamadana, resembling an elephant
fragrant with the temporal exudation, stay, occupying the left of the
forces. I myself along with Lakshmana, shall needfully stay in the
fore-front. And the monkeys, Jambavan, Sushena and Vagadarci, the three
high-souled, foremost bears,[67]--shall protect the interior (of the
forces). And as the Sun, surcharged with energy, protects the hind half
of the globe, let the monkey-monarch protect the rear of the
monkey-army". And that army being skilfully divided into parts and
protected by great monkeys, resembled the welkin covered with clouds.
Then, taking up mountain-peaks and mighty trees, the monkeys began to
proceed towards Lanka burning to crush Lanka in battle. "We shall
demolish Lanka by hurling mountain-peaks, or with our clenched fists".
Thus did the foremost of monkeys think in their minds. Then the
exceedingly energetic Rama addressed Sugriva, saying,--"Our forces have
been rightly marshalled,--let go (now) Suka". Hearing Rama's words, the
lord of monkeys possessed of great strength, liberated the envoy, Suka,
at the command of Rama. Liberated at the word of Rama, Suka, who had
been sore tormented by the monkeys, oppressed with exceeding great fear,
went to the lord of Rakshasas. Thereat, Ravana, laughing, said unto
Suka,--"Are thy wings fettered? And thou seemst as if thy wings had been
severed. Why? Didst thou come under the control of the volatile
(monkeys)?" Thereat, exercised with fear, Suka, commanded by the
monarch, answered the lord of Rakshasas in this excellent speech,
saying,--"Repairing to the northern shore of the sea, I, pacifying (the
monkeys) with mild speech, communicated thy tidings clearly (unto
Sugriva). Thereat, as soon as they saw me, the monkeys flying into a
wrath, captured me, and attempted to clip my wings and slay me with
their clenched fists. They are insuseptible of being spoken to. No doubt
whatever can exist that, O lord of Rakshasas, the monkeys are by nature
wrathful and fierce. The same Rama that hath slain Viradha and Kavandha
and Khara, hath arrived (here) along with Sugriva, searching for the
whereabouts of Sita. Having thrown a bridge across the brine and crossed
the salt sea, Raghava, equipped with his bow, stayeth here, setting the
Rakshas at naught. And the hosts consisting of thousands of bears and
monkeys, resembling hills and clouds, envelope the Earth. And peace
there can be none between the forces of the Rakshasas and the hosts of
the sovereign of monkeys, like unto the deities and the Danavas. And
they advance before the wall. Speedily do one of these things--make over
Sita without delay, or give (him) battle". Hearing Suka's speech, Ravana
with his eyes reddened in wrath, spoke, as if burning (Suka) with
them,--"Even if gods, and Gandharbas, and Danavas should array
themselves against me, I will not from fear of all creatures, render
(back) Sita. When shall my shafts pursue Raghava, like maddened
Bhramaras making towards blossomy trees in spring? When by means of
flaming shafts shot from my bow shall I burn (Raghava) with his body
bathed in blood, even as a meteor (burneth) an elephant? And when,
surrounded by a mighty host, shall I confound his ranks, even as the Sun
arising, (vanquisheth) the light of the stellar spheres? My impetuosity
like the Ocean's, my strength like the Wind's, Dacarathi doth not
know,--and therefore it is that he desireth to fight with me. Rama hath
not seen my shafts resting in the quiver, resembling venomous
serpents,--and therefore it is that he seeketh to fight with me. Raghava
hath not in conflict formerly known my bow representing my Vina sounded
with my shafts; having tremendous sounds proceeding from the strings;
dreadful; with the cries of distressed people for its mighty strains of
music; and resonant with the reports of Narachas and palms. And, having
bathed in the great field of battle representing the river of hostile
forces, I will in the encounter strike (this Vina). Neither the
thousand-eyed Vasava, nor Varuna himself, can (cope) with me in battle;
nor can Yama, or Vaicravana's self vanquish me in mighty conflict with
the fire of arrows".

SECTION XXV.


On Dacaratha's son, Rama, having crossed the Ocean with his forces, the
graceful Ravana addressed his two counsellors, Suka and Sarana,
saying,--"The crossing the entire ocean incapable of being crossed, by
the monkey-forces, and the building over the sea of the bridge by Rama--
all this had never happened before. The construction of a bridge over
the ocean cannot at all command credence. But (however it be), I must
enumerate the monkey-hosts. Entering the monkey-army unobserved, it
behoveth you to ascertain the magnitude thereof, its strength, who are
the foremost monkeys, who are the councilors assembled there of Rama,
and who of Sugriva, who range at the head, who among the monkeys are
heroic; how they have constructed the bridge over the water of the
ocean; how the high-souled monkeys stay there; Rama's, as well as
Lakshmana's purpose, prowess and the arms (they fight with). And who is
the commander of those magnanimous monkeys? Having learnt all this
truly, ye ought to return speedily". Being thus commissioned, these
heroes, the Rakshasas, Suka and Sarana, assuming monkey-shapes, entered
into the hosts of monkeys. But Suka and Sarana could not number that
army of monkeys, incomprehensible and capable of making people's hair
stand on end. The forces were on mountain-tops, by fountains and in
caves. And those rangers of the night beheld those forces, some having
already crossed, and some crossing, and some intent on doing so; and
some having sat down and some sitting--that mighty army sending terrific
roars,--that ocean of hosts incapable of being disturbed. As they
remained thus disguised, they were discovered by Vibhishana. Thereat,
taking them captive, he unfolded (the fact) unto Rama, saying,--"These
are the counsellors of the lord of Rakshasas--Suka and Sarana. O captor
of hostile capitals, they have come as spies from Lanka". Seeing Rama,
they were greatly afflicted, and, despairing of their lives and
exercised with fear, with joined hands, said,--"O placid one, commanded
by Ravana, we have come here, O son of Raghu, for the purpose of
gathering information concerning this army". Hearing their speech,
Rama--son unto Dacaratha--ever engaged in the welfare of all beings,
laughing, remarked,--"If you have heedfully noted this entire array, or
if you have done what ye had been commanded to do, return in peace. If
aught remaineth unseen, do ye see it anew. Or Vibhishana will again
fully show it unto you. Having been taken, ye need not fear on the score
of your lives. Even if envoys happen to be taken who are equipped with
weapons, they should not be slain. And albeit these night-rangers have
come as spies in disguise, with the view of creating division among
their foes, yet, O Vibhishana, let them off. Entering the extensive
Lanka, ye should say unto the king--younger brother unto the Dispenser
of riches--the words which I utter,--'That force relying on which thou
hast carried away my Sita, do thou as thou wishest, along with thy
forces and friends, display the same. On the morning of the morrow
behold the city of Lanka with her wall and gates, as well as the hosts
of Rakshasas, destroyed by me with my shafts. And as Vasava equipped
with the thunder-bolt hurleth the same amidst the Danavas, will I, O
Ravana, on the morning of the morrow pour down my dreadful ire upon thee
along with thy forces.'" Thus directed (by Rama), those Rakshasas, Suka
and Sarana, having saluted the righteous Raghava with 'Victory!,' came
(back) to Lanka and spoke unto the lord of Rakshasas, saying,--"O lord
of Rakshasas, having been taken by Vibhishana for the purpose of being
slain, we came to be seen by the righteoua-souled Rama of immeasurable
energy, and (finally) were liberated (by him). As these four persons
have combined--like unto the Lokapalas, heroic, accomplished in arms,
and of steady prowess--viz., Dacaratha's son, Rama, the graceful
Lakshmana, Vibhishana, and the highly powerful Sugriva, resembling the
great Indra, these are capable of uprooting the city of Lanka--walls and
gateways--and replacing her (on her former site),--leave thou the
monkeys aside. Such is Rama's figure and arms that he shall alone
demolish Lanka,--leave the other three alone. And that host protected by
Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva, shall become exceedingly hard to combat
even by the Asuras and gods.--And the army of the high-souled rangers of
the woods, eager for encounter, contains warriors bursting with high
spirits. No use of dispute. Be thou intent on pacification. Do thou
render back Maithili unto Dacaratha's son".



SECTION XXXI.


Hearing Sarana's words, pregnant and truthful, king Ravana addressed
him, saying,--"Even if the gods, Gandharvas and Danavas should attack
me, Sita will I not part with from fear of all creatures. O amiable one,
thou, having been hard handled by the monkeys and distressed in
consequence, deemst it fit that Sita should be rendered back this very
day. What foe of mine is there who is competent to conquer me in
battle?" Having uttered this rough speech, the graceful Ravana--lord of
the Rakshasas--desirous of surveying (the monkey-hosts), ascended an
edifice white like snow, and elevated like many palms (placed one upon
another). And transported with passion, Ravana in company with those
spies, saw the sea, mountains and forests. And they beheld the Earth
enveloped with monkeys, and the mighty host of monkeys, boundless and
irresistible. And having seen this, king Ravana asked Sarana,--"Who
among these monkeys are the foremost, who are the heroes, and who
possessed of great strength? Who, bursting with spirits, stay all about
the fore? Whom doth Sugriva listen to? And who are the leaders of the
monkey-leaders? O Sarana, relate thou all this unto me. And what is the
prowess of the monkeys?" Thereat, Sarana, knowing the chiefs (of the
monkey-army), spoke unto the sovereign of Rakshasas, who had asked
(him), as to who were the heads of the rangers of the woods. "This
monkey, that, setting up roars, stayeth in front of Lanka, surrounded by
hundreds and thousands of monkey-leaders, by whose tremendous shouts
Lanka trembleth with her wall, gateways, hills, woods and forests, and
who is posted in front of the forces of the high-souled Sugriva--master
of all the monkeys--is the heroic leader of monkey-bands named Nila. And
that one, possessed of prowess, who, folding up his arms, paceth the
gound on foot, who, facing Lanka, from wrath is frequently yawning, who
resembles a mountain-peak and is like the filaments of a lotus, who,
enraged again and again soundeth his tail, and the ten cardinal points
resound with the sounds of whose tail,--is he who hath been sprinkled by
Sugriva--king of monkeys--the heir apparent, named Angada. He
challengeth thee to the fight. The worthy son of Vali and ever dear unto
Sugriva, he putteth forth his prowess, as Varuna doth for Sakra. That
that well-wisher of Raghava, the vehement Hanuman, hath seen Janaka's
daughter, was owing to the advice of this one. That powerful (hero) is
proceeding, taking innumerable bands belonging to the lord of monkeys,
for the purpose of beating thee by means of his soldiery. Following
Vali's son, and surrounded by a mighty force, stayeth in the field the
heroic Nala, the builder of the bridge. Those that with their limbs
lying inactive, and setting up roars and ululations, are following this
one,[68] are heroes dwelling in _Chandana_.[69] With his own army alone,
the silver-hued Sweta of dreadful prowess hopes to subdue Lanka.
Marshalling his monkey-forces and cheering up his soldiers, that
intelligent monkey, famed over the three regions, having speedily met
with Sugriva, is retracing his steps. From days of yore on the banks of
the Gomati there is a mountain, (named) Ramya, (otherwise) called
Sanrochana. The mount abounds with various trees. There that leader of
bands, named Kumuda, governs his kingdom. And he that cheerfully draweth
after his hundreds and thousands of monkeys, and the long grim hairs of
whose tail, coppery, yellow, sable and white, are cast about, is the
energetic monkey, Chanda, eager for encounter. And he hopes to conquer
Lanka by help of his own forces. And this one, resembling a lion, tawny
and furnished with a long mane, who, remaining apart, vieweth all Lanka
as if consuming her with his eyes, dwelleth for ever and a day in
Vindhya, the mountain Krisha, Sahya, and the mount Sudarcana, and, a
leader of bands, is named Rambha. Three hundred Kotis of the foremost of
monkeys, dreadful and fierce and possessed of terrific prowess,
surrounding (him) go in his wake for the purpose of demolishing Lanka by
their (native) might. And he that expandeth his ears and yawneth again
and again, who defieth the fear of death and doth not move his forces,
who trembleth for wrath and eyeth frequently askance,--and behold the
lashing of his tail!--and who setteth up leonine shouts, O king, with
great energy and with fear cast off,--resideth in the romantic mount,
Salweya, and, a leader of companies, is named Sarabha. To him, O king,
belong forty hundred thousands of powerful leaders. And he that stayeth,
like unto a mighty mass of clouds covering up the sky, in the midst of
the monkey-heroes, as doth Vasava in the centre of the celestials, whose
lofty shout is heard (mingled with) the uproar set up by the foremost
monkeys, burning for battle, dwelleth in the excellent hill Parijatra;
and, ever irrepressible in fight, is named Panaca, a leader of
(monkey)-bands. Fifty _lacs_ of leaders with their forces arranged,
environ this commander of monkeys. He that stayeth gracing the dreadful
array overflowing with talk, stationed on the shore of the
ocean,--resembling a second sea and like unto Durdara[70]--is the leader
named Vitata. And he rangeth, drinking of (the waters of) the
Vena,--best among streams--and his forces are sixty lacs of monkeys. And
the monkey, named Krathana, challengeth thee to conflict. He hath (under
him) powerful and vigorous generals, and forces well divided. And the
monkey owning that person of the hue of red chalk, and, who, elated with
strength, disregardeth all the monkeys,--is named Gavaya, who
approacheth thee wrathfully. Several lacs (of troops) girt him round;
and by their means he has to bring down Lanka. These are the heroes,
incapable of being borne, whose numbers cannot be enumerated. These are
the leaders and the heads thereof, as well as the forces set in order of
battle".

      next _sloka.--T._

SECTION XXVII.


As thou lookest on, I shall describe unto thee the leaders who shall put
forth their prowess for Raghava, lay down their lives (in his behalf.)
That one of dread deeds the long hairs on whose long tail, coppery, and
yellow, and black, and white, thrown up, look like the rays of Sun, and
are trailing over the ground, is the monkey, named Hara; whom follow
hundreds and thousands (of monkeys) desperately upraising trees, intent
upon (scaling) Lanka--leaders of the monkey-king and his servants
present (in that conflict.) And these whom thou beholdest present,
resembling mighty masses of sable clouds, like unto black collyrium, of
genuine prowess, countless and incapable of enumeration dwelling in
mountains, provinces, and rivers,--terrible beings--approach thee, O
king. In their amidst is their king, gray eyed and of fierce appearance,
like unto Parjanya[71] encompassed by clouds,--who dwelleth in that best
of mountains, Rikkhavan, drinking of the Narmada.--Behold this one
resembling a hill--younger brother of Dhumra, lord of the bears. He is
equal to his brother in beauty, and of superior prowess. This leader of
redoubtable leaders named Jambavan. He is mild, obedient to his
superiors and fierce in fight. The intelligent Jambavan assisted Sakra
signally in the war of the gods and Asuras, and he hath won many boons
(in consequence). Ascending the tops of mountains, these hurl down
gigantic crags huge as colossal clouds, nor doth (the fear of) death
(ever) disquiet them. And their bodies covered with hair, they resemble
Rakshasas and ghosts (in their conduct). This one of immeasurable energy
hath innumerable troops going about, who behold this leader of leaders
under unusual excitement leaping and resting (by turns). This lord of
monkeys dwelleth near the thousand-eyed Deity; and this leader of bands,
gifted with strength, is named Rambha. And he that going, toucheth with
his side a mountain situated at the distance of a Yojana, and, rising
up, measureth the same length,--and whose beauty is surpassed by none
among quadrupeds,--is known under the name of Sannadana, the
grand-father of the monkeys;--this intelligent one battled with
Sakra,[72]--nor did he meet with discomfiture. This is that general of
the forces. And he whose prowess is like that of Sakra, is this one
begot by Fire on a Gandharva's daughter, for assisting the celestials on
the occasion of the war of the gods and the Asuras. And this graceful
and powerful one--best of monkeys--disporteth in that sovereign of
mountains inhabited by numbers of Kinnaras, where king Vaicavana eateth
rose apples, and which, O lord of Rakshas, ever conduceth to the
pleasure of thy brother. And this one who never extolleth himself in
battle, is named Krathana--leader of hosts. Surrounded by a thousand
Koti (of troops), and stationed in the midst of the monkeys, he hopeth
to subjugate Lanka with his own troops alone. And he that roameth about
the Ganga, terrifying leaders of elephant-herds, remembering the former
hostility of the monkeys and the elephants, is this leader of bands,
who, roaring, opposeth wild elephants in mountain-caverns and crusheth
trees,--and foremost of monkeys, and chief of the monkey-forces--like
Sakra himself in heaven, sporteth, resorting to Uciravija pertaining to
Mandara, best of mountains, on the golden river.[73] A thousand lacs of
monkeys, elated with vigor and prowess, setting up roars and furnished
with (long) arms follow him; and this one is the leader of those high
souled monkeys. And, O king, he whom thou seest resembling clouds
uplifted by the winds, is a leader named Pramathi. And his
fleet-coursing soldiery are fiery, and volumes of red-hued dust are
scattered about him profusely on all sides. And these wondrous strong
and dreadful Golangulas[74] numbering hundreds and hundred thousands,
seeing the building of the bridge, surrounding, O mighty monarch, the
leader named Gavaksha--a Golangula--set up shouts, intending to demolish
Lanka with their prowess. Where the trees bring forth fruits of every
season and the black bees resort,--in the mountain furnished with solar
splendour, which the Sun circumambulates, by whose radiance ever beam
beasts and birds with a like hue,--whose table-lands are never forsaken
by magnanimous Maharshis; where the trees yield every object of desire
and all are fraught with fruits; in which best of mountains excellent
honey is found,--there in the charming Golden hill, O king, sporteth
this one--the foremost of the principal monkeys, Kacari by name, a
leader of bands. There are sixty thousand charming Golden hills. In
their midst is that best of mountains,[75] even as thou, O sinless one,
art among the Rakshas. There in the inmost hill dwell (monkeys)
tawny-hued; and white,--with coppery faces; yellowish like honey;
sharp-toothed; having nails for their weapons; and four teeth like
lions; irresistible like tigers all equal to Vaicwanara, and resembling
flaming venomous snakes; furnished with long tails; like unto mad
elephants; seeming like gigantic hills; roaring like mighty clouds; with
eyes tawny and round; of terrific mein; and emitting sounds,--and these
are gazing at Lanka, as if devastating her. And this powerful one
staying in their midst, is their leader, eager for victory; and the
puissant (monkey) always looketh like the Sun himself; and this one, O
king, is famed on earth by the name of Satavali. And this heroic one,
powerful and mighty, established in his own prowess, hopeth to devastate
Lanka with his own forces. And for compassing Rama's desire, the monkey
doth not cherish any kindness for his life. Gaya, Gavaksha, Nala, and
the monkey Nila--each of these is encompassed by ten _kotis_ of
warriors. (Besides these) there are other choice monkeys dwelling in the
Vindhya mountain, but I cannot enumerate these (monkeys) possessed of
fleet vigor, in consequence of their vast number. All these, O mighty
monarch, are of exceeding prowess,--all possess persons resembling
mighty mountains; and all are competent in a moment to remove mountains
and scatter the Earth with them".

SECTION XXVIII.


Having heard the words of Sarana, who had described the forces (of the
monkeys), Suka, addressed Ravana, lord of Rakshasas, saying,--"Those, O
king, whom thou seest stationed, resembling mad elephants, like unto
_nyagrodhas_[76] belonging to the Ganga,--like unto Saias in the
Himavan,--are incapable of being borne,--they are possessed of strength,
and able to wear forms at will; resembling deities and Danavas, and like
the gods in conflict. These, numbering nine, five, and seven thousand
_kotis_ and thousand _sankus_ and an hundred _vrindas_, are the
ministers of Sugriva, residing in Kishkindha--monkeys begot by gods and
Gandharvas, capable of assuming shapes at will. And those two whom thou
beholdest, staying there, of equal proportions and endowed with god-like
shapes, are Mainda and Dwivida,--who have no equals in fight. Permitted
by Brahma, they had partaken of ambrosia. They hope to humble Lanka by
their prowess. And he whom thou seest staying like a mad elephant, the
monkey who, being enraged, can by his strength agitate the deep itself,
who, searching for Vaidehi, had presented himself before thee,
lord,--behold this monkey come again!--whom thou hadst seen
before![77]--is the eldest son of Kacari, known as the offspring of the
Wind-god--celebrated as Hanuman, who had bounded over the deep. Capable
of wearing forms at pleasure, that first of monkeys is endeued with
grace and strength,--and is of irresistible impetuosity even as that
lord, the Wind. Seeing the Sun risen, (he) while a boy, resolving in his
mind,--'Coursing a way measuring three thousand _yojanas_, I will bring
the Sun,--my hunger is not appeased;' and he sprang up, elated with
strength. And, not getting that god, incapable of being subdued by the
deities, saints and Rakshasas, he dropped down on the Ascending-hill.
And thereat a jaw of that strong-jawed one was a little fractured on the
rock,--and he is called Hanuman in consequence. I know this monkey and
all his previous history. I cannot describe his strength, beauty or
prowess. And this one alone hopes to lay Lanka low by his energy. And
why dost thou today forget the monkey, who had flung flaming fire into
Lanka? And next to him is the hero of dark-blue hue, having eyes like
lotuses, the Atiratha among the Ikshwakus--of prowess celebrated in the
world--in whom virtue never wavereth and who never swerveth from
righteousness; who knoweth the Brahma Mantra and the Vedas,--the best of
those versed in them--who pierceth the sky with his shafts and cleaveth
the Earth, whose ire is like death, and whose prowess is like that of
Sakra,--whose wife, Sita, hath been carried away by thee from
Janasthana. And this is Rama, who, O king, advanceth to encounter thee
in conflict. And on his right side is one of the splendour of pure gold,
broad-breasted, having dark curled hair--this one is named Lakshmana,
ever mindful of his brother's welfare. He is versed in polity as well as
warfare--the foremost of those learned in all the branches of knowledge;
wrathful, invincible, victorious, powerful, conquering and strong,--the
right arm of Rama and his own life going about. For Raghava he careth
not for his life. He hopeth to exterminate all the Rakshasas in battle.
He that stayeth occupying the left side of Rama, and surrounded by
Rakshasas, is the king, Bibhishana, sprinkled as the king of Lanka by
the auspicious king of kings,--he, filled with wrath, approacheth thee
(for battle). And he whom thou seest staying in the middle like a
firm-based mountain, the lord of all monkeys, of immeasurable
prowess,--and who in energy fame, intelligence, strength, and lineage,
is as superior to the monkeys as the mountain Himavan overtoppeth all
the mountains, who in company with the principal monkey-leaders dwelleth
in inaccessible Kishkindha hard to penetrate, and dense with trees, and
difficult of access, and denying approach on account of rocks; and whose
golden garland consisting of an hundred lotuses looks exceedingly
elegant, which is the desire of men and gods, and where is established
Lakshmi--(is Sugriva). And Rama, having slain Vali, hath conferred this
garland, Tara, and the eternal monkey-kingdom on Sugriva. An hundred of
an hundred thousand is called a _koti_ by the wise. An hundred of a
thousand _koti_ is called a Sanku. An hundred of a thousand Sanku is
known as a Mahacanku. An hundred of a thousand Mahacanku is here termed
a Vrinda. An hundred of a thousand Vrinda is known as a Mahavrinda. A
thousand Mahavrinda is called here a Padma. An hundred of a thousand
Padma is known as a Mahapadma. An hundred of a thousand Mahapadma is
termed a Kharva. An hundred of a thousand Khara is termed a Samudra. An
hundred of a thousand Samudra is known as a Mahaugha. Thus backed by a
thousand _koti_, and a hundred Sanku, and a thousand Mahacanku, and an
hundred Vrinda, and a thousand Mahavrinda, and an hundred Padma, and a
thousand Mahapadma and an hundred _kharva_, and an equal Samaudra and an
equal Mahaugha,--by _kotis_ of Mahaughas--resembling the sea,--and
surrounded by the heroic Bibhishana as well as his counsellors,--that
Lord of monkeys, always engirthed by a mighty force, and possessed of
exceeding strength and prowess, will encounter thee in battle. Observing
this host, that hath presented itself, resembling a flaming planet, do
thou, O mighty monarch, prepare thyself to the uttermost,--so that
victory may be thine, and that thou mayst not come by discomfiture at
the hands of the foe".

SECTION XXIX.


Seeing the leaders of monkeys as pointed out by Suka,--the exceedingly
puissant Lakshmana--Rama's right arm--and his[78] brother Bibhishana
staying near Rama, and Sugriva of dreadful prowess--sovereign of all the
monkeys,--and the strong Angada, grandson unto the thunder-handed
one,[79] and the powerful Hanuman; and the unconquerable Jambavan; and
Sushena; and Nila; and Nala--best of monkeys,--and Gaya; and Gavaksha;
and Sarabha; and Mainda; and Dwivida,--Ravana, with his heart agitated a
little, and his wrath aroused,--when their talk had ended, rebuked those
heroes, Suka and Sarana. And he wrathfully spoke unto them, standing in
humble guise with their heads hung down, harsh words faltering with
passion,--"That counsellors subsisting (on the wealth of their master
and sovereign), should say aught disagreeable to him, whether they meet
with his favor or disfavor--is not meet. Without being questioned, it is
(proper) for you both to hymn the praises of a foe that is opposed and
that hath advanced for encounter! Ye have in vain worshipped your
preceptors, aged people, and spiritual guides, for ye have failed to
appropriate the cream of Political Science, which should be availed of.
Or if ye had appropriated the same, you have forgotten it afterwards;
and ye bear the burden of ignorance. And it is owing to my good fortune
that, having such stupid counsellors, I have as yet held my kingdom.
Have ye no fear of death that ye use harsh speech towards me, who am the
ruler and whose tongue dispenseth good and evil? Even trees may exist in
the forest, coming in contact with burning fire; but transgressors
cannot exist, visited with the chastisement of the monarch. I shall slay
these wicked wights, who praise the side of the enemy, if my anger be
not moderated, remembering their former good offices. Avaunt! Go hence
from near me! I do not wish to slay you, remembering your good acts.
Slain ye (already) are, who are ingrate and cherish no affection for
me". Thus accosted, Suka and Sarana, seeing (how things stood), covered
with bashfulness, went out, saluting Ravana by uttering 'Victory!' Then
that ranger of night, the Ten-necked one, said unto Mahodara, who was
present, to summon some spies. Thus accosted, Mahodara speedily ordered
some spies (to present themselves). Thereat, the spies, hurriedly
arriving there at the mandate of the monarch, and, presenting
themselves, stood with joined hands, uttering blessings of victory. Then
the lord of Rakshasas, Ravana, addressed the spies, who were heroic,
faithful, calm, and courageous,--"Go hence, and acquaint yourselves with
the exertions of Rama; as well as with those who, being the custodians
of Rama's closest counsels, have gladly joined him (here). How he
sleepeth and how he waketh, and what he engageth himself in,--having
deftly acquainted yourselves with all this thoroughly, do you come (back
here). The wise king that gathers (a knowledge of) his enemy through
spies, can, putting forth a modicum of effort in conflict, neutralise
(his exertions)". Thereat the spies, saying,--"So it is", taking Sardula
to the fore, with delighted hearts went round the sovereign of the
Rakshasas. And, having gone round the high-souled Rakshasa-chief, the
spies set out for where Rama with Lakshmana was. And repairing secretly
to the vicinity of the mountain bordering on the fair shore,[80] they
saw Rama and Lakshmana with Sugriva and Bibhishana. And seeing that
host, they were overwhelmed with fear. And, while staying there, they,
discovered by the righteous lord of Rakshasas, Bibhisana, were sore
harassed (by the monkeys). And that wicked Rakshasa, Sardula, alone was
taken (before Rama). But Rama liberated him, who was assailed by the
monkeys. And Rama also, entertaining no enmity against them, also
liberated the others, (who accompanied Sardula). And, on having been put
to straits by the powerful monkeys of fleet vigor, they,[81] breathing
hard, and with their consciousness lost, again arrived at Lanka. Then
those exceedingly strong spies, always ranging outside, presenting
themselves before the Ten-necked one, informed him of the forces of
Rama, stationed near mount Suvela.

SECTION XXX.


Then the spies communicated unto Lanka's lord news concerning Raghava
and his host stationed at the mount Suvela. Hearing the words of the
spies, that Rama, accompanied by a mighty army, had arrived (there),
Ravana was a little agitated and spoke unto Sardula,--"Thy color hath
changed its natural aspect, and, O ranger of the night, thou lookest
poorly. Didst not come under the control of the wrathful foes?" Thus
ordered by him, then (Sardula), bewildered by fear, addressed that tiger
of a Rakshasa, saying,--"Those powerful monkeys, O king, puissant,
strong, and protected by Raghava, are incapable of being ranged (by us).
And they cannot be conversed with or interrogated. All around, the
courses are kept by monkeys resembling hills. As soon as I entered, and
was scanning that host, I was discovered. And forcibly taken by the
Rakshas, I was pulled by them hither and thither. And furiously assailed
by the monkeys with thighs, clenched fists, teeth, and palms, I was
dragged in the midst of the army by the enraged monkeys. And, after
having been taken all about, I was (at length) taken before Rama,
bleeding, with my limbs showing sorry work, and my senses swimming and
paralysed. And, having been belabored by the monkeys, I, on craving his
kindness with joined hands, was, at his pleasure, rescued by Raghava,
with, "Don't, don't"! Having filled up the deep with rocks and crags,
Rama equipped with weapons, stayeth, occupying the gate of Lanka. And,
letting me off, that one of suspasstng vigor, surrounded by monkeys,
and, arranging his forces in the Garuda fashion, advanceth upon Lanka.
And he draweth nigh to the wall. Therefore, do one of these things in
preference to the other,--either render back Sita, or give him battle".
Hearing this, Ravana, lord of Rakshasas, then reflecting in his mind,
spoke unto Sardula these pregnant words,--'Even if the gods, Gandharvas,
and Danavas should array themselves against me, Sita I shall not give,
from fear of all creatures". Having said this, that exceedingly
energetic one again said,--"Thou hast ranged this army. Who here among
the monkeys are heroic? And, amiable one, what is their potency? And
what are those monkeys that are hard to approach, like? And, O thou of
fair vows, whose sons and grandsons are they? Truly relate all this (to
me). Having ascertained their strength and weakness, I shall in this
matter adopt my course. Those who wish for fight, certainly take account
of all this". Thus addressed by Ravana, Sardula--best of spies--thus
begin to speak in the presence of Ravana,--"O king, that unconquerable
one in fight, Jambavan, is well known as the son Gadgada, king of bears.
The other son of Gadgada is the son of Sakra's preceptor. By which son,
single-handed, was done immense oppression to the Rakshas. And the
righteous and puissant Sushena is the son of Dharma.[82] And the mild
monkey, Dadhimukha, O king, is the son of Soma.[83] And Sumukha,
Durmukha and the monkey, Vegadarcin (resembling) Death himself, were for
certain begot by the Self-create in the shape of a monkey.[84] And Nila
himself is the son of the bearer of sacrificial oblations;[85] and
Hanuman is famed as the son of the Wind-god. And the irrepressible and
youthful Angada is the grandson of Sakra. And the lusty Mainda and
Dwivida are sprung from Acwi. And five are the sons of Vaivaswata,
resembling the Reaper himself--Gaya, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sarabha and
Gandhamadana. But I can not enumerate the rest, ten _kotis_ of heroic
monkeys--all sons of deities--burning for battle. And this is
Dacaratha's son--this youth resembling a lion, who slew Dushana and
Khara and _Triciras_. There breathes none on Earth that is like unto
Rama in prowess, by whom was slain Viradha and Kavandha, resembling the
Destroyer. No person can on earth describe the virtues of Rama; by whom
have been slain all those Rakshasas that had gone to Janasthana. And
here also is the virtuous Lakshmana, like unto the foremost of
elephants, coming in the way of whose shafts, even Vasava doth not live.
And here are Sweta and Jyotirmukha, sprung from Vatskara's self; and the
monkey Hemakuta is the son of Varuna. And the heroic Nala--best of
monkeys, is the son of Vicwakarma. And powerful and impetuous, Durdhara
is the son of Vasu. And that foremost of Rakshasas, Bibhishana, thy
brother, engaged in the welfare of Raghava, hath laid seige to Lanka.
Thus have I described unto thee the entire monkey host stationed in
mount Suvela. As for what remaineth to be done, thou art the master".

 [82] Righteousness.

 [83] Moon.

 [84] Another meaning is,--_"The monkey, Vegadarci--who is Death himself
      in the shape of a monkey"._ But I give the more acceptable sense.

SECTION XXXI.


Then the spies of the king informed him of the forces of Raghava,
incapable of being agitated, which had stationed themselves on mount
Suvela. Hearing the arrival of Rama's mighty army from the spies, Ravana
was a little agitated, and he spoke unto the ministers,--"Let the
ministers speedily present themselves, having their wits about
them,--the time forsooth hath come for counsel". Hearing his mandate,
those Rakshasas, his counselors, swiftly presented themselves. And then
he consulted with his Rakshasa counselors. Having deliberated duly, that
resistless one, dismissing his ministers, entered his own abode. Then,
taking with him the highly strong Vidyujjibha, huge-bodied and gifted
with the powers of illusion, he entered where Mithila's daughter was.
And the lord of Rakshasas said unto Vidyujjibha, skilled in
illusion,--"Do thou bring Janakas daughter under the sway of illusion.
And, O ranger of the night, do thou, taking an illusory head of Raghava,
as well as a mighty bow with the shaft (set), present thyself before
me". Thus accosted, the night-ranger, Vidyujjibha, saying, "So be it,"
displayed that desired illusion unto Ravana. Thereat, the king, eager to
meet with Sita in the Acoka woods, well-pleased, conferred an excellent
ornament on him. Then the exceedingly powerful lord of the Nairitas, the
younger brother of the Dispenser of riches, entered (into that place)
and saw (there Sita) distressed, albeit unworthy of distress,--with her
head hung down, overwhelmed with woe,--sitting on the ground, staying at
the _acoka_ woods, engaged in the contemplation of her lord, conciliated
by dreadful Rakshasis remaining near. Then, drawing near Sita, Ravana,
proclaiming his exultation, said these haughty words unto the daughter
of Janaka,--"O gentle one, he depending on whom thou, being soothed by
(me), slightest me--that slayer of Khara, thy husband, Raghava, hath
fallen in battle. Thy roots have been competely severed, and thy pride
hath been destroyed by me. In consequence of this calamity, O Sita, thou
shalt become my wife. O foolish (girl), renounce this idea. What wilt
thou do with him that is dead? O meek (wench), be thou the mistress of
all my wives. O thou of slender religious merit! O thou whose object
hath been defeated! O thou that presumest to be wise! Hearken unto the
destruction of thy lord, like the dreadful destruction of Vritra!
Surrounded by a vast army gathered by the sovereign of the monkeys,
Raghava had presented himself on the shore of the sea, for compassing my
destruction. And on the sun having set, Rama stationed himself with his
mighty army, oppressing the northern shore (of the sea). Then at
midnight (my) spies coming to that host, thus stationed, fatigued from
travel, and sleeping soundly (in consequence),--first ranged it. Then my
mighty forces led by Prahasta slew his host overnight, where was present
Rama along with Lakshmana. And repeatedly upraising _patticas_ and
bludgeons, swords, rods and other mighty weapons; and (discharging)
showers of arrows, and darts, and daggers and maces and sticks and crows
and bearded darts and discuses and clubs;--the Rakshasas discharged
these among the monkeys. And while Rama was sleeping, the furious
Prahasta by means of a mighty falchion, with speed cut off his head
clean. Bibhishana, who was flying at his will, was taken captive. And
Lakshmana along with the monkey-army hath departed somewhere. And, O
Sita, Sugriva--lord of monkeys--hath his neck broken; and, O Sita, with
his jaw fractured, Hanuman hath been slaughtered by the Rakshasas.--And
Jambavan, endeavouring to spring up with his thighs, was slain in the
conflict; being severed by bearded darts, even as a tree cut off. And
the stalwart Mainda and Dwivida--those foremost of monkeys--sighing and
lamenting, bathed in blood,--destroyers of foes--were cut off with a
sword. And Panaca is rolling on the earth like a (veritable) Panaca.[86]
And mangled by many iron arrows, Darimukha lieth in a cave. And the
exceedingly energetic Kumuda, dumb, is slain by shafts. And torn by
innumerable (arrows) discharged on all sides by Rakshasas, Angada,
vomitting blood, lieth on the ground.[87] And the monkeys, hard pressed
by elephants, and others by networks of cars, lie low in the field,
having been agitated like clouds by winds. And others afflicted with
affright, flee, attacked (by the enemy) in the rear, and followed by the
Rakshasas, like mighty elephants pursued by lions. And some have fallen
into the sea, and some have taken refuge in the sky; and the bears have
mounted up trees along with the monkeys. And on the shore of the sea,
and in mountains and woods many are the tawny-hued monkeys that have
been slain by Rakshasas of frightful forms. Thus hath thy lord been
slain by my forces, along with his army; and I have his head, washed in
blood and besmeared with dust". Thereat, the exceedingly irrepressible
lord of Rakshasas, Ravana, spake unto a Rakshasi, in the hearing of
Sita,--"Bring (hither) the Rakshasa, Vidyujjibha of cruel deeds, who
hath personally brought Raghava's head from the field". Thereat,
Vidyujjibha, taking the head along with the bow, bowing down the head
(unto Ravana), stood before him. Then spake king; Ravana unto the
Rakshasa, Vidyujjibha of the long tongue, who was staying by,--"Do thou
at once hold before Sita the head of Dacaratha's son. Let her clearly
behold the ultimate sad plight of her lord". Thus addressed, that
Raksha, throwing that graceful head before Sita, swiftly vanished. And
Ravana cast down the mighty blazing bow, famed through the three worlds,
saying,--"This is Rama's. This is the bow of thy Rama with the string
fixed. Slaying that man over night, Prahasta brought it hither".

SECTION XXXII.


Seeing that head and that excellent bow, and (remembering) the union of
(Rama) and Sugriva related by Hanuman,--and (seeing) those eyes, and the
complexion of that face, and that countenance like unto that of her
lord,--and that hair and that forehead; and that beautiful jewel forming
the crest; and recognizing (Rama) by all these tokens combined,--
(Sita), exceedingly aggrieved, rebuked Kaikeyi, lamenting like a female
osprey,--"O Kaikeyi, have thy wishes attained. Slain hath been the son
of the race; and the entire race is exterminated by thee, partial to
dissension. And what evil had been done unto Kaikeyi by the revered
Rama, that along with me, he hadst been banished into the woods, with
rags given him (for his covering)?" Having said this, Vaidehi, forlorn
and trembling (all over), dropped to the earth, like a plantain cut off.
Then, recovering after a while, and having regained her consciousness,
the large-eyed one, placing the head in her front, gave way to grief.
"Ah! I am undone, O mighty-armed one! O thou that didst follow stern
vows! From thy (death), I have come by this final plight, having been
rendered a widow. The greatest calamity (that can befall a woman), is
said to be the death of her husband. And, possessor of an excellent
character, thou hast departed before me, who have ever trod the path of
the righteous; but who have come by a mighty grief and am plunged in a
sea of sorrow. And thou, who was engaged in delivering me, hast thyself
fallen! And my mother-in-law, Kaucalya, attached (to thee), through the
death of thee, her son, at the hands of Rakshasas, hath been reduced to
the condition of a cow that hath been deprived of her calf. O Raghava,
even the astrologers had predicted long life for thee. But their words
are false,--thou, O Raghava, wast short-lived. Or didst thy wisdom, wise
and good as thou wert, come to naught? For God, who is the origin of all
beings, maketh (every one) reap the fruit of his own acts. And why,
versed in polity as thou wast, didst thou come by death, unforeseen?
Thou wast acquainted with the means of warding off misfortune, and
skilled in doing so. And having been brought hither by me, representing
the Fatal Night, fierce and fell,--after (being) embraced, and by
force,--the lotus-eyed one hath met with his death. Here liest thou, O
long-armed one, leaving me lone,--and embracing the Earth like thy
beloved fair. Ever carefully worshipped with perfumed wreaths, this bow
of thine, O hero, embellished with gold, is dear unto me. O sinless one,
thou hast surely gone to heaven, and (art there) in the company of thy
sire and my father-in-law, Dacaratha, and all thy ancestors. Thou hast
become a star of the firmament as the fruit of thy great act.[88] Thou
hast disregarded thy righteous race of Rajarshis. O king, why dost thou
not look at me? And why is it that thou dost not answer me, who am a
girl, hardly arrived at youth,--and who am thy wife and companion? That
thou at the time of thy espousing my hand hadst vowed--I will practise
(righteousness) with thee--do thou, O Kakutstha, recollect the same, and
take me, who am overwhelmed with distress. Why, O best of goers, hast
thou gone from this world to that other, leaving behind me, overwhelmed
with distress? That person of thine which, decked out with auspicious
things, I used to embrace, beasts of prey will for certain tear the
same. Having performed the Agnishtoma and other sacrifices with
_Dakshinas_ (dispensed),--why hadst not thou attained purity by means of
the sacrificial fire? Kaucalya, overwhelmed with sorrow, shall only
behold one of the three that had gone away to distant lands,--come
(back)--Lakshmana. And, on being asked by her, he shall relate thine as
well as the deaths of thy friend's troops over night at the hands of the
Rakshasas. And, O Raghava, hearing thee slain while asleep, and me
staying in the abode of the Raksha, she with her heart cleft (in twain),
shall cease to exist. And for the sake of me, abject that I am, that
sinless son of the king, Rama, possessed of prowess, having crossed the
ocean, hath been slain in the footprint of a cow. I, the befouler of my
line, who had been wedded by Dacaratha's son through want of discretion,
becoming the wife of the revered Rama, was (in reality) his Death.
Without doubt, in another birth I had abstained from choice gifts,--and
therefore it is that I sorrow to-day, albeit being the wife of one that
was (ever dear) unto guests. Do thou, O Ravana, speedily slay me upon
Rama; and, bringing the wife to the husband, compass my best benefit. Do
thou join my head to his and my body to his body. I will, O Ravana,
follow the way of my high-souled lord". Thus, burning in grief, did that
large-eyed one indulge in lamentations; and Janaka's daughter kept fast
gazing at the head and bow of her lord. And as the Rakshasa was by while
Sita was thus bewailing, there appeared before his lord, with joined
hands, the warder, saying,--"May the worshipful one be victorious!" And
saluting and propitiating him, (Ravana), he told him that Prahasta,
general of the forces, had arrived. "Prahasta hath come to thee,
surrounded by all the courtiers. And, O lord, I was despatched by him,
desirous of seeing thee. O mighty monarch, surely there is--and thou art
forgiving from thy regal sentiment[89]--some work which is momentous;
and do thou see them". Hearing these words of the Rakshasa, the
Ten-necked one, leaving the acoka wood, went to see the counselors. And,
having decided his entire course of action in consultation with his
competent advisers, (Ravana), entering his court,--well knowing Rama's
prowess, set about his work. And as soon as Ravana left that place, that
head and that bow vanished. And in company with the councilors of
dreadful power, (Ravana) decided his course with reference to Rama. And
then the lord of Rakshasas, Ravana, resembling the day of doom,
addressed his generals,--all well-wishers--staying hard by, saying,--"Do
ye speedily summon my forces with the beat of drums--nor do ye give out
the reason (of the summons)". Then assenting to his speech with "So be
it," the envoys immediately summoned that mighty force; and, when it had
arrived, they informed their master, eager for conflict, of its arrival.

 [88] _The carrying out the command of thy sire.--T._

 [89] This dislocated period insinuates that Ravana, possessed of royal
      nature, should forgive this untimely intrusion.--T.



SECTION XXXIII.


Seeing Sita overwhelmed with grief, a Rakshasi, named Sarama, who was
the beloved companion (of Sita), drew near to her dear (friend),
Vaidehi. And the mild-speeched Sarama comforted the exceedingly
distressed Sita, who had been bereft of her senses by the lord of
Rakshasas. Sita, who was protected there (by Sarama), had been made a
friend by her. And, protecting her at the command of Ravana, that
kind-hearted companion, firm in vows, saw Sita, deprived of her
consciousness. And she[90] comforted with a friend's affection that one
of fair vows, who was rolling in the dust and rising up from it like a
mare.[91] "Having come to the solitary wood for protecting thee, I,
renouncing all fear of Ravana, have, remaining hid, heard everything
that he addressed unto thee, as well as what thou hadst replied unto
him. For thee, O thou of expansive eyes, I have no fear of Ravana. And,
O Maithili, I, coming out, have also learnt well as to why the lord of
Rakshasas hath gone out hence hurriedly. Rama, acquainted with self, is
incapable of being surprised in sleep; nor doth the slaying of that
tiger-like one commend itself to me as probable. And the monkeys
fighting with trees, well protected by Raghava, like the gods protected
by the foremost of the celestials, are incapable of being slain. And,
possessed of arms long and rounded; graceful; broad-breasted; powerful;
accoutred with the bow; and mailed; righteous; and famous over the
earth; endowed with energy; and along with his brother, Lakshmana, ever
protecting himself and others; of noble descent; and versed in polity;
the destroyer of the hostile ranks; and of inconceivable strength and
manhood,--the graceful Raghava, O Sita, slayer of foes, is not slain.
This illusion hath been spread around thee by that fierce,
illusion-creating one, whose mind ever runs upon improper acts and who
opposeth himself to all creatures.--All thy sorrow hath departed, and
thy good day hath dawned. Certainly Lakshmi seeketh thee. And, O lady,
hearken unto what is dear to thee! Having crossed over the ocean, along
with the monkey-host, Rama hath encamped himself on the southern shore
of the sea. By me hath been seen the complete Kakutstha along with
Lakshmana, accompanied by the forces, stationed on the marge of the
main,--protected (by his native might). Those Rakshasas of fleet vigor
who had been despatched by this one, have brought the news that Raghava
hath crossed.--And, O large-eyed lady, having learnt this news,
Ravana--lord of Rakshasas--is consulting with all his counselors". As
the Rakshasi, Sarama, was relating this unto Sita, she heard the leonine
roars of the army, emitted with the greatest energy. And, hearing the
mighty sounds of kettledrums produced by sticks struck (thereon), the
honey-tongued Sarama spoke thus unto Sita,--"These dreadful sounds of
the kettledrum, O mother, call to arms. And hark to the solemn notes of
the kettledrums, resembling the rumbling of clouds! The mad elephants
are caparisoned and the car-horses are yoked; and thousands (of
warriors) are seen, mounted on steeds, with bearded darts in their
hands. And, as waters fill up the ocean, mailed warriors of wonderful
forms, vehement and roaring, by thousands rush out on all sides and fill
the highways. And mark the splendour spread around by the polished arms
and bucklers and mail,--and by the cars, horses and elephants of the
followers of the Rakshasa-chief,--consisting of many hues shooting
up,--like unto the appearance of a fire in summer, burning a
forest,--and also mark the excitement of ihe high-spirited and
fast-coursing Rakshas![92] And hear the sounds of bells and the rattling
of the car-wheels! And hear the neighing of the steeds and the reports
of the drums And fierce is the excitement of these Rakshasas--followers
of the Raksha-chief,--with their hands hearing upraised arms,--capable
of making people's hair stand on end. The sorrow removing Sree espouseth
thee; and the fear of the Rakshas is come. And as Vasava did unto the
Daityas, the lotus-eyed Rama, thy lord--of controlled anger, and of
inconceivable prowess, slaying Ravana in battle and thus delivering
thee, shall approach thee. And, as Vasava put forth his prowess among
his foes, in company with the foe-destroying Vishnu, thy lord, along
with Lakshmana, shall display his prowess among the Rakshas. On the
enemy having fallen, I shall behold thee, devoted to thy lord, with thy
desire attained, soon lying on the lap of Rama. And, O Janaki, embracing
(thy lord), thou shalt shed tears of joy on his mighty breast. And, O
Sita, soon shall the highly powerful Rama loosen this braid of thine
reaching unto thy hips, which thou hast been wearing for many a month.
And, O exalted one, seeing his face like the full moon risen, thou shalt
shed water begot of ruth, even as a she-serpent casts off her slough.
And, O Mithila's daughter, speedily slaying Ravana in battle, that one
worthy of happiness shall reap felicity in the company of thee, his
beloved. And, loved by the high-souled Rama, thou shalt be happy, even
as the Earth furnished with crops brought forth by plenteous showers. Do
thou, O exalted one, take refuge with him, who, going round the foremost
of mountains, speedily assumeth a steed-like circular movement; for even
the maker of day is the source of people's joy and grief".

 [90] Sarama.--T.

 [91] The commentator intelligently remarks: _As a mare does, to remove
      fatigue.--T._

 [92] This line of verse defies all attempts to make it fall into
      syntactical order with the rest of the sentence. It is a hideous
      hiatus in the passage.--T.



SECTION XXXIV.


Burning with grief on account of those words,[93] Sarama gladdened and
cheered her, even as masses of clouds (cheer up) the burning Earth. And
then, desirous of doing her good, (Sita's) friend, conversant with
season, and ever preluding her speech with a smile, spoke unto her
seasonably,--"O thou having dark eyes, I can, secretly going to Rama and
communicating to him thy auspicious words, come back clandestinely. Nor,
when I course the supportless sky, can even the Wind or Garuda follow
me". As she said this, Sita with her grief a little lightened, said unto
Sarama in sweet and smooth words,--"Thou art capable of even going to
the nethermost regions. But do thou on my behalf that which is fit to be
done by thee. If thou intend doing me a good turn, and if thy sense be
steady, I would know what Ravana is doing after having left this place.
That guileful and wicked-minded one, Ravana, destroyer of enemies,
having powers of illusion, overwhelms me even as the Varuni just drunk.
Confining me here for ever and a day, (Ravana) sets on dreadful
Rakshasas to alike threaten and scold me constantly. And I am agitated
and alarmed, and my mind is (always) uneasy. And I, dwelling in the
_acoka_ wood, is ever agitated. If there is any talk (of delivering me),
or keeping me confined,--thou shouldst communicate unto me the decision
arrived at. This is the highest favor that I seek (at thy hands)".
Thereat, the mild-speeched Sarama, wiping (Sita's) face washed in tears,
spake unto her, as she said this,--"If this is thy wish, I will go, O
Janaki. O Mithila's daughter, having possessed myself of the intent of
the enemy, I shall come back". Having said this, (Sarama), repairing to
the Raksha, heard Ravana's converse with his counselors. And having
heard of the decision of that wicked-minded one, she, understanding
decisions, swiftly retraced her steps to the fair _acoka_ forest. And
then, entering there, she saw Janaka's daughter, expecting (her) like a
very Sri, bereft of her lotus. And, the fair-spoken Sarama, on getting
back (near her), Sita, embracing her affectionately, herself gave her a
seat. "Sitting down here at ease, do thou relate to me faithfully all
about the determination of the wicked-minded and guileful Ravana". Thus
accosted by the trembling Sita, Sarama related everything that had been
said by Ravana and his counselors. "O Vaidehi, the Raksha lord was
advised by his mother and the aged counselors in pregnant words informed
with affection, having thy deliverance for their object. 'Do thou make
over Maithili unto the king of men, paying him homage due. Thou hast, in
Janasthana profusely witnessed wonderful instances (of his prowess). The
crossing of the ocean, Hanuman's sight (of Sita),--and the slaughter of
the Rakshas in fight,--what person is capable of doing all this in
battle?' Thus long exhorted by his counselors as well as his mother,
Ravana doth not make up his mind to emancipate thee, even as a covetuous
person is loath to part with wealth (appropriated). And, O Maithili,
without renouncing his life in battle, he doth not intend to liberate
thee. Even this is the determination which that cruel one hath arrived
at along with his advisers. This intent is in consequence of their
coveting surcease. He can not yield thee up from sheer fear; nor is he
backward in battle, or shirketh his own destruction or that of all the
Rakshasas. O dark-eyed lady, slaying Ravana in battle with sharp shafts,
Rama shall take thee back to Ayodhya". In the meanwhile there was heard
a mighty uproar occasioned by the whole host, and drums and
conchs,--which shook the earth. Hearing that hubbub of the monkey-army,
the servants of the Rakshasa monarch, ran who were in Lanka,--growing
dispirited and bereft of energy, with weakness overcoming their
powers,--did not see any good, in consequence of the fault of the ruler.

 [93] _i.e._ the words of Ravana.



SECTION XXXV.


And that captor of hostile capitals, the mighty-armed Rama, was
advancing (upon Lanka) with the sounds of drums mixed with the blares of
conchs. Hearing this noise, Ravana--lord of Rakshasas--reflecting for a
while, cast his eyes upon his counselors. And addressing there all those
counsellors, that afflictor of the world--the crooked and highly
powerful lord of the Rakshasas, Ravana, making his court
resound,--running down (Rama's) crossing the main, as well as his vigor,
strength and manhood,--said to them,--"What ye have said touching Rama's
(prowess), hath been heard by me. And I also know ye to be of sterling
valor in the field. Yet why, knowing Rama's prowess, do ye silently look
at each other?" Then the maternal grand sire (of Ravana), possessed of
exceeding wisdom, named Malyavan, hearing his words, said,--"The king
that is accomplished in the various kinds of learning,[94] and that
followeth polity, ever commandeth affluence and bringeth his enemies
under his subjection. He that seasonably concludes peace and carries on
war with his enemies,--and who advances his own party, attaineth great
affluence. A king should enter into peace, if he be an equal or inferior
of his adversary, and engage in war, if be more powerful,--but an enemy
should never be disregarded. Therefore, O Ravana, peace with Rama is
what commends itself to me; and do thou render unto him that for which
thou hast been invaded (by him), _viz._, Sita. All the Devarshis and
Gandharvas wish for (Rama's) victory. Therefore, do not enter into
hostilities with him; but do thou bend thy mind to ther conclusion of
peace with him. That possessor of the six attributes, the Great-father,
hath appointed two courses, (respectively) for the Asuras and the
celestials, having for their proper objects righteousness and
unrighteousness. Righteousness, we hear, is the course of the
high-souled celestials, as, O Rakshasa, unrighteousness is that of
Rakshas and Asuras. During the Krita Yuga, righteousness swalloweth up
sin; and during Tishya,[95] unrigheousness swalloweth up virtue. Thou,
ranging the three worlds, hadst extinguished pregnant piety, and reaped
unrighteousness; and it is for this that thy foes have waxed potent.[96]
And, having grown through thy neglect, unrighteousness devoureth us, and
that protector of the gods, (righteousness), is strengthening the side
of the celestials. Thou, addicted to carnal pleasures and acting in
defiance of duty, hadst aroused the high wrath of the saints resembling
fire. The power of these possessed of souls sanctified through
asceticism, and ever engaged in invoking the aid of righteousness, is
incapable of being resisted and is like flaming fire. The twice-born
ones engage in contemplation with intent minds, and loudly recite the
Vedas. They overpower the Rakshas, uttering the Vedas; and thereat they
fly in all directions like clouds scattered in summer. And the smoke
that ariseth from the Agnihotra sacrifices of saints resembling fire,
enveloping the energy of the Rakshasas, spreads over the ten cardinal
quarters. And ther fierce austerities of vow-observing saints, performed
at particular sacred spots, try the Rakshasas sore. Thou hast obtained a
boon, conferring immunity at the hands of deities, Danavas and Yakshas.
But men and monkeys, bears and Golangulas, possessed of enormous
strength and endowed with vigor, and of indomitable prowess,--coming
here, are setting up roars. Witnessing various and many dire portents, I
perceive the destruction of all the Rakshasas. Dreadful and terrific
clouds, uttering harsh sounds, are showering blood all around Lanka. And
(live) vehicles are dropping profuse tears. And all sides, covered with
dust, do not appear bright as formerly. And beasts of prey, jackals and
vultures, are emitting frightful cries, and, entering into the garden of
Lanka, form themselves into bands. And in dreams mighty dark-hued women
in front of dwellings, seizing at (the furniture ) thereof, and speaking
inauspiciously, laugh displaying their sable teeth. And in houses dogs
are feasting on the articles of worship. And cows bring forth asses, and
mongooses, mice. And cats are pairing with leopards, and swine with
dogs, and Kinnaras with Rakshasas and human beings. And red-footed white
sky-coursing pigeons, urged on by Doom, are going about for the
destruction of the Rakshasas. And female-parrots in houses, wounded and
worsted by other birds delighting in discord, are dropping down,
emitting indistinct notes. And all the birds and beasts are crying
(distressfully) with their faces turned towards the sun. And at dusk a
frightful, withered, tawny-hued male figure, looking like Death himself,
with his head shaven, peereth into the houses (of people). These and
other evil omens occur. Rama I deem as Vishnu assuming the form of a
man. Raghava of steady prowess, for certain, is no human being,--he that
hath built a bridge over the deep, must be an exceedingly wonderful
person. Therefore, O Ravana, conclude peace with Rama--king of men.
Having ascertained fit course, do thou act properly". Having said this
unto that vile one, and knowing the intention of the lord of Rakshas,
that strong Malyavan, of exceeding prowess, became silent, eying Ravana.

 [94] The commentator says there are four and ten kinds of learning: but
      unfortunately he does not enumerate them.--T

 [95] The Kali Yuga.--T

 [96] While ranging the three worlds on a career of conquest, thou
      didst, disturbing sacrifices, _etc._, wrong righteousness.--T



SECTION XXXVI.


The Ten-necked one, come under the control of Time, did not brook the
beneficial speech spoken by Malyavan. Contracting his face into a frown,
he, coming under the masterdom of passion, with his eyes rolling in
wrath, addressed Malyavan, saying,--"The words which, deeming the
strength of the enemy as superior, thou hast harshly spoken, considering
it as beneficial, had never before entered my ears. A (mere) man, and
feeble, and alone, and having monkeys for his support, why dost thou
deem Rama, who hath (further) been cast off by his sire, and hath in
consequence taken refuge in the woods,--as competent (to cope with me)?
And why dost thou consider me, who am the lord of the Rakshas, and
feared even by the immortals,--as weak and reft of all power? Thou, I
suspect, speakest (thus) roughly either from jealousy of my heroism, or
for inciting me. And who that is wise and learned, ever addresseth him
roughly that is at once puissant and of (high) station, if not to spur
him on? Why, having brought Sita like a Sri shorn of her lotus, shall I
give her up, from fear of Raghava? Behold Raghava, environed by Kotis of
monkeys, with Sugriva and Lakshmana, slain one of these days! He before
whom even the gods cannot stay in the field,--how can that Ravana ever
come by fear? Better that I should be riven in twain,--but bend I never
will. This is my native fault; and nature is incapable of being
overcome. And if Rama hath at his pleasure constructed a bridge over the
ocean, what is the wonder in this that thou hast conceived such a fear?
And although Rama hath crossed the ocean along with the monkey-army, yet
I swear unto thee truly, living, he shall not back hence". When Ravana,
wrought up with passion, had spoken thus, Malyavan, knowing him wroth,
did not return a reply. And, duly tendering blessings unto the king,
Malyavan, taking his permission, went to his own abode. And the
Rakshasa, Ravana, along with his courtiers, having consulted together as
to what was fit to be done, set about the defence of Lanka. And he
commanded the Rakshasa Prahasta (to guard) the Eastern gate; and the
exceedingly powerful Mahaparcwa and Mahodara (to guard) the Southern
gate; and he ordered his son Indrajit, possessing mighty powers of
illusion, girt by innumerable Rakshasas, to guard the Western gate. And
he commanded Suka and Sarana to defend the Northern gate. But he said
unto the counsellors,--"I will myself go thither".[97] And he posted in
the middle in the garrison the Rakshasa, Virupaksha, endowed with
exceeding prowess and energy, backed by countless Rakshasas. Having
taken these measures in Lanka, the Rakshasa-chief, urged by Fate, deemed
himself as having achieved success. Having thus completely provided for
the defence of the city, he dismissed the ministers; and, honored by the
counsellors with blessings of victory, (then) entered his magnificent
and splendid inner apartment.

 [97] _i.e._ to defend the Northern gate.--T.



SECTION XXXVII.


Those kings, man and monkey, that monkey the Wind-god's son,
Jambavan--sovereign of bears--the Rakshasa, Bibhishana, the son of Vali,
Angada, Sumitra's son, the monkey, Sarabha, Sushena along with his
friends, Kumuda, Nala, and Panaca, arriving at the dominions of the
enemy, assembled together, began to deliberate. "Yonder is that Lanka
ruled by Ravana, invincible even unto the celestials, serpents and
Gandharvas. Let us, keeping before us success in the enterprise, consult
together for the purpose of arriving at a decision. We are here daily
nearing Ravana, lord of Rakshasas". As they were speaking thus, Ravana's
younger brother, Bibhishana, said in a pregnant speech free from
provincialism,--"Anala, Panaca, Sampati and Pramati--all courtiers of
mine--having gone up to Lanka, have come back here. Wearing the forms of
birds, they entered into the hostile forces; and, having seen the
measures that had been adopted (by them), have come (back). O Rama,
hearken to me as I tell thee truly anent the provisions which they have
related, made by the wicked-minded Ravana. In the Eastern gate stayeth
Prahasta along with his forces; in the Southern, the exceedingly
powerful Mahaparcwa and Mahodara; and in the Western, Ravana's son,
Indrajit, supported by innumerable Rakshasas, equipped with _patticas_,
swords and bows, and bearing darts and maces in their hands,--surrounded
by heroes carrying various weapons. And, backed by many thousands of
Rakshasas weilding weapons, and accompanied by Rakshasas conversant with
counsel, Ravana himself, his heart agitated to the height, guardeth the
Northern gate of the city. And Virupaksha with a powerful force
accoutred in javelins, clubs and bows, protects the garrison in the
centre. Having seen these hosts thus disposed in Lanka, my counsellors
have speedily come back here. There are ten thousand elephants, an Ayuta
cars, two of horses, and about a _koti_ of Rakshasas, powerful and
strong, and equipped with arms in conflict.[98] These night-rangers are
ever the favorites of the Rakshasa ruler. And, O king, a _koti_ of
forces accompany each of these Rakshasas in battle". Having conveyed
this information concerning Lanka, which had been communicated by his
counsellors, the mighty-armed Bibhishana showed (unto Rama) those
Rakshasas themselves. And in company with his counsellors, Ravana's
graceful younger brother, ever striving for the welfare of Rama, by way
of answer communicated everything that was going forward in Lanka unto
Rama, having eyes resembling lotus-leaves,--"O Rama, when Ravana battled
with Kuvera, sixty lacs of Rakshasas marched forth (to meet him). In
prowess, energy, vigor, exceeding fortitude, and hauteur, they resembled
the wicked-minded Ravana himself. In this matter, thou ought not to grow
wroth,--I only arouse thy wrath, and do not endeavour to frighten
thee.[99] Thou canst subdue even the celestials by thy prowess.
Therefore thou, environed by a mighty army, having arrayed the
monkey-forces in order of battle, shalt thrash Ravana (in battle)". When
Ravana's younger brother had spoken thus, Raghava, said these words with
reference to his beating the foe,--"Let that foremost of monkeys, Nila,
surrounded by an immense number of monkeys, cope with Prahasta at the
Eastern gate of Lanka. And, engirt by a mighty force, let Angada, son of
Vali, resist Mahaparcwa and Mahodara at the Southern gate (thereof). And
let that son of the Wind-god, Hanuman, backed by innumerable monkeys,
(beating the host stationed) at the Western gate, find entrance (into
the city). I myself, determined to compass the destruction of the lord
of Rakshasas, who, waxing powerful in consequence of the boon he hath
received, hath brought about the destruction of high-souled saints
resembling gods and Danavas,--and who goeth round all regions,
oppressing people,--will, along with Sumitra's son, smiting (the foe),
occupy the Northern entrance, where Ravana with his army is stationed.
And let the powerful king of monkeys, and the puissant sovereign of
bears, and the younger brother of the Rakshasa-chief, manage the
soldiery posted in the centre. And in this battle, the monkeys need not
assume the forms of human being. And let this serve for a sign that the
monkeys, in order to the recognition of our own forces, appear with
their proper monkey-marks. We seven only shall battle with the foe in
human shapes,--_viz_., I along with my brother, the exceedingly
energetic Lakshmana, and my friend Bibhishana counting for the fifth in
company with his own following". Having said this unto Bibhishana, for
attaining success in the enterprise, that lord, the intelligent Rama,
seeing the sides of Suvela more beautiful (than other places), intended
to ascend it. Then, environed by a mighty host, the high-souled and
magnanimous Rama, his features mirroring forth high
exultation,--overshadowing the entire Earth (with his forces), set out
for Lanka, determined upon destroying the enemy.

 [98] These are, remarks the commentator, the leaders.--T.

 [99] _i.e._ "Thou ought not to be angry with _me_; for I do not
      frighten thee, but rouse thy _wrath against Ravana".--T._



SECTION XXXVIII.


Having been bent upon mounting Suvela, Rama, followed by Lakshmana,
addressed in sweet and excellent words, Sugriva, and that righteous
night-ranger, Bibhishana, versed in counsel and conversant with
precepts, who was devoted to him,--saying,--"We shall all ascend this
mount Suvela, bedight with metals; and pass this night even here. And
(from here) will we view the abode of that Rakshasa who, foul of soul,
hath carried off my spouse, to bring destruction down on himself,--who
knoweth nor morality nor good conduct nor behaviour (conducive to the
dignity of his descent),--and who, in consequence of his base
propensity, hath committed himself to so heinous a course of action".
Having decided thus, Rama, filled with wrath at Ravana, coming to
Suvela, ascended its variegated plateau. And Lakshmana, collected, went
in his wake. And, upraising bow and arrow, Sugriva, (ever) engaged in
valorous acts, accompanied with Bibhishana as well as his counselors,
following him, also ascended (the mountain). And all those rangers of
mountains, gifted with the vehemence of the Wind in hundreds ascended
mount Suvela, where Raghava was stationed. And ascending the mountain in
a short time, they all beheld from its summit the city, appearing to be
built on the air. And the monkey-leaders beheld Lanka, exceedingly
splendid with noble gateways; gracefully enclosed with a wall; thronging
with Rakshasas; and defended by sable Rakshasas. And the foremost of
monkeys saw these appearing like another wall (overtopping the one
beneath). And on seeing the Rakshasas, the monkeys burning for battle
set up various roars in the presence of Rama. Then the Sun, crimsoned
with Eve, ascended the Setting-hill and Night came, illumined by the
Moon at his full. Then the master of the monkey-army, Rama, saluted and
honored by Bibhishana, accompanied by Lakshmana as well as the leaders
of the monkeys, sojourned happily on the breast of Suvela.



SECTION XXXIX.


Having passed the night in Suvela, the heroic monkey-leaders surveyed
woods and forests in Lanka. And seeing those extensive (woods and
forests), mild, and charming, and beautiful to behold, they were seized
with wonderment. Abounding in _champakas_, _acokas_, _vakulas_, _calas_,
and palms; covered with _tamalas_ and _panacas_,--and environed all
around with trees,--and surrounded with Hintalas, Aryunas, blossoming
Saptaparnas, Tilakas, Karnikaras, and Patalas,--trees with flowering
tops, en tert wined with creepers,--Lanka looked exceedingly lovely,
with various sights,--resembling the Amaravati herself of Indra. And
trees there, furnished with variegated flowers having tender rosy
leaves,--and blue lawns, and rows of woods; and bearing odourous and
charming blossoms and fruits,--looked like men adorned with ornaments.
And there a delightful and pleasant wood resembling Chaitraratha, and
like unto Nandana itself--having all the seasons present,--appeared
beauteous to the view, with black bees all around. And it had Datyuhas,
and Koyasthivas, and peacocks dancing; and the strains of the coels were
heard at the woodland rills. And the heroic and exhilarated monkeys,
capable of wearing forms at pleasure, entered those woods and groves
frequented by maddened birds and ranged by Bhramaras,--tracts
overflowing with the lays of coels, and ringing with the voices of
songsters,--resonant with the notes of Bhramaras--sovereigns of their
species--and eloquent with the cries of ospreys. And as the exceedingly
energetic monkeys entered, there blew upon them the breeze--like unto
life--redolent of perfume obtained from contact with the blossoms. And
others of the leaders among the heroic monkeys, coming out from the
bands, ordered by Sugriva, made in the direction of Lanka crowned with
ensigns. And, terrifying the fowls and dispiriting beasts and birds and
shaking Lanka with their roars, those foremost monkeys set up shouts.
And they, endowed with great impetuosity, went on, oppressing the earth
with their battle-array; and clouds of dust suddenly arose from the the
march of the soldiery. And bears, and lions, and buffaloes, and
elephants, and deer, and birds, overwhelmed with affright, made for the
ten cardinal points. The graceful and lovely summit of Trikuta was
entire, elevated, sky-piercing, of golden splendour, measuring an
hundred yojanas, clear-shining, level, inaccessible even to fowls, and
incapable of being ascended even in thought--not to say of actual
ascension by people. Lanka, ruled by Ravana, was situated on its[100]
top,--ten yojanas in width and twenty in length. And that city was
graced with lofty ornamented gateways resembling pale clouds, and golden
and silvern walls; and Lanka was adorned with palaces and piles; like
the sky[101] graced with clouds on the approach of the rainy season. And
that palace, which was adorned with thousands of pillars, and which, as
if piercing the heavens, looked like a peak of Kailaca--was the
residence of the Sovereign of the Rakshasas--the ornament of the city,
(ever guarded by full hundreds of Rakshasas). And Lakshmana's auspicious
and puissant elder brother, beholding that flourishing and wealthy city
resembling the celestial regions,--charming to the mind, made of gold,
graced with mountains, and decked out with mountains containing various
metals,--resonant with the notes of various birds; abounding in various
beasts,--furnished with various kinds of flowers,--and inhabited by
various orders of Rakshasas,--was struck with astonishment. And Rama,
surrounded by his mighty forces, saw that palace, filled with diverse
kinds of gems, adorned with rows of edifices, and having huge engines
and gateways.

SECTION XL.


Then Rama, accompanied by the monkey-leaders, along with Sugriva,
ascended the top of Suvela, measuring a circumference of two _yojanas_.
And staying there for a while and looking at the ten cardinal points, he
saw Lanka finely placed on the charming summit of Trikuta,--graced with
elegant groves; and (he also saw) the unconquerable lord of Rakshasas,
stationed at the top of the gateway, fanned with white _chamaras_;
graced with the umbrella betokening victory; smeared with red sandal;
adorned in red ornaments; resembling masses of sable clouds; and
apparelled in golden attire,--his breast bearing scars from the
tusk-ends of Airavata; covered with a sheet hued like the blood of
hares; and appearing like clouds lighted up by the evening sun. And on
seeing the Rakshasa-chief, Sugriva suddenly rose up in the sight of the
lords of monkeys as well as Raghava. And influenced by wrath, he,
mustering strength and vigor, rising from the brow of the mountain,
bounded to the gateway. And pausing for a while and eying the Rakshasa
intrepidly, he, slighting the Raksha, addressed him in harsh speech,
saying,--"O Rakshasa, I am the friend as well as the slave of Rama--lord
of men. Me, backed by the energy of that king of the Earth, shalt thou
not escape to-day". Saying this, he, suddenly springing up, descended on
him; and snatching away his variegated crown, let it fall on the earth.
And seeing him come abruptly, the night-ranger spoke to him thus,--"Thou
that wert Sugriva beyond my ken, shalt be neckless[102] near me". Having
said this, he rose up swiftly and dragged him[103] down to the earth.
Thereat springing like pith, the monkey pushed down his antagonist with
his arms. And each having his body bathed in sweat and his person
covered with blood, each choking and annuling the efforts of the
other,--and resembling a _Salmali_ or a _Kincuka_, and dealing blows and
slaps, and hitting with his arms and hands,--those exceedingly strong
ones, the lord of the Rakshasas and that of the monkeys, fought
wonderfully. And having for a long time encountered each other in combat
on the dais belonging to the gate,--they, now lifting up their persons
and now lowering them, went down, each felling the other with his legs.
And smiting each other, they, their bodies fastened together, went down
between the wall and the moat,--and again stood upon the ground. And
heaving breath, they, resting for a space, grappled with each other; and
they fast bound each other with their arms serving for ropes. And each
fired with wrath, and each having both strength and skill, they now bore
themselves in the lists like a tiger and a lion, furnished with teeth;
or like the young of the foremost elephants engaged in encounter,--and
restraining and pushing each other with their arms, they simultaneously
both came down to the ground. Then starting again to their feet, they,
vituperating each other, ranged the lists, displaying feats expressive
of skill and strength. Nor did those heroes speedily come by fatigue.
And resembling mighty elephants, they, resisting each other by means of
their powerful arms like unto the trunks of elephants, fought for a long
while, swiftly wheeling about the arena. And approaching each other,
they strove to slay each other, like unto two cats seated, momentarily
encountering each other over some food. And the lord of monkeys and
Ravana, accomplished in fight, coursed the arena, displaying wonderful
mandalas,[104] various _sthanas_[105] curious _gomatrakas_[106]
_gatapratyagatas_, _tiraschi-nagatas_, _vakragatas_, _parimokshas_,
_varjanas_, _paridhavanas_, _abhidravanas_,[107] _aplavanas_,[108]
_savigrahavasthanas_,[109] _paravrittas_,[110] _apavrittas_,[111]
_apadrutas_[112] _avaplutas_,[113] _apanyastas_,[114] and
_upanyastas_.[115] In the meanwhile the Raksha attempted to put forth
his power of illusion. Knowing this, the king of monkeys shot into the
sky. And Ravana, overpowered by fatigue and out of breath, thus baffled
by the monkey-king, stood where he was. Thus the master of the foremost
monkeys, securing fame in fight, beat the night-ranger, causing him to
experience fatigue. And bounding beyond the spacious sky, the offspring
of the Sun came to the side of Rama in the midst of the monkey-forces.
And having done that deed, the son of the Sun,--lord of monkeys--with
his heart surcharged with rejoicing, entered that host having the speed
of the wind; enhancing the martial ardour of the son of the foremost of
the Raghus, and honored by the monkeys.

[102] The text has _hinagriva--neckless_. There is a pun here, turning
      on the word _griva_--neck. Ravana says: "Thou wert Sugriva

SECTION XLI.


Seeing those ominous signs, Lakshmana's elder brother, Rama, embracing
Sugriva, said,--"Without consulting with me, thou hast acted thus
rashly. But kings should not act in such a rash way. Placing in
suspense, me, this army and Bibhishana, thou, O hero, enamoured of
daring deeds, hast put thyself to all this trouble. But, O hero,
henceforth, do not act so. O subduer of enemies, if thou come by any
mischance, what shall Sita avail me; or Bharata; or my younger
brother--Lakshmana; or Satrughna, O slayer of enemies; or, again, my own
person? Ere thou hadst come, I had arrived at this determination;
albeit, O thou that art equal to the mighty Indra or Varuna, I knew thy
prowess full well. Slaying Ravana in battle along with his sons, forces
and vehicles, and installing Bibhishana in Lanka, and placing the
kingdom in the hands of Bharata, I shall renounce my body, O exceedingly
powerful one!" When Rama had said this, Sugriva answered,--"Knowing my
own strength, how, O Raghava, viewing Ravana, who had ravished away thy
wife, could I forbear, O hero?" As that hero was speaking thus, Raghava
addressed Lakshmana having auspiciousness, thus,--"O Lakshmana,
occupying some tract furnished with cool water and woods bearing fruits,
we shall sojourn, dividing and marshalling our forces. I see a mighty
fear present, destructive of people,--and boding destruction unto the
foremost heroes among the bears, monkeys and Rakshasas. The winds
ruffle; and the earth is tremulous. And the tops of mountains tremble,
and the mountains themselves send up loud sounds. And the clouds are
goblinish; and fierce; and harsh-sounding. And wearing terrific looks,
they fiercely pour down showers mixed with drops of blood. And the
Evening resembles the red sandal, and is fearful. And a flaming circle
droppeth from the Sun. And exciting great fear, inauspicious birds and
beasts, wearing cruel looks, and in distressful guise,--cry in piteous
accents, facing the Sun. And at night, the ominous Moon with a black-red
brim as at the time of universal wreck, burneth. And, O Lakshmana, there
is a crimson, rough, slight, and graceful rim round the Sun; and a blue
mark is visible on his disc. And the stars do not course as formerly.
Behold, O Lakshmana, all these, prefiguring the Doom. And crows and
hawks and vultures drop down. And jackals yell with loud inauspicious
notes. The Earth, converted into mud with flesh and gore, shall be
covered with darts and javelins and swords, discharged by Rakshasas and
monkeys. This very day with all expedition shall we, surrounded on all
sides by the monkeys, march towards the city governed by Ravana". Having
said this unto Lakshmana, Lakshmana's elder brother possessed of
exceeding strength, hastily descended from the top of the mountain. And
descending from the mountain, the righteous Raghava surveyed his troops,
incapable of being beaten by enemies. And after making the mighty host
of the monkey-king equip itself, Raghava versed in season, along with
Sugriva, at the proper hour, issued orders for battle. Then in due time
that one, accoutred with his bow, surrounded by a mighty army, set out,
with the intention of entering the city of Lanka. And those
two--Bibhishana and Sugriva--and Hanuman, and Jambavan, and Nala, and
the bear-king Nila, and Lakshmana, followed (Rama). Behind them, the
mighty array of bears and monkeys followed Raghava, covering a wide
surface of land. The monkeys, resembling elephants, capable of resisting
foes, took mountain-peaks and tall trees by hundreds. And in a short
time those repressors of foes--the brothers Rama and Lakshmana--arrived
at the city of Ravana; with pennons streaming over her; charming;
garnished with groves and woods; having variegated gateways;
inaccessible; and having walls and gates. And urged on by Rama's
command, the wood-rangers,[116] as commanded, blocking up (Lanka)
incapable of being subdued even by the gods, stationed themselves.
Coming to Lanka ruled by Ravana, that hero, Rama, son unto Dacaratha,
along with Lakshmana, remained stationed at the Northern gate, where
Ravana used to reside. None save Rama was competent to protect that
dreadful gate, where Ravana used to reside. None save Rama was competent
to protect that dreadful gate, guarded by Ravana himself, like the Ocean
guarded by Varuna,--and protected on all sides by terrible Rakshasas
equipped with weapons; capable of striking terror into the weak; like
unto the nether regions guarded by Danavas. And (Rama) saw there many
and various arms and mail of the warriors, ranged together. And coming
to the Eastern gate, that leader of the monkey-army, the powerful Nila,
along with Mainda and Dwivida,--took up his post there. And the
exceedingly strong Angada, accompanied by Rishava, Gavaksha, Gaya, and
Gavaya, occupied the Southern gate. And the mighty monkey Hanuman
protected the Western entrance. And Sugriva himself, with Prajangha,
Tarasa and other heroes, was quartered near the garrision in the centre.
And accompanied by all the foremost monkeys resembling Suparna or the
Wind, twenty _kotis_ of renowned monkey-leaders, blocking up all sides,
stationed themselves near the monkey, Sugriva. And at Rama's command,
Lakshmana along with Bibhishana, went from door to door, issuing
instructions to _kotis_ of monkeys. On the west of Rama, Jambavan along
with Sushena, followed by innumerable troops, remained hard by at the
garrison in the middle. And those tiger-like monkeys, furnished with
teeth like unto tigers, weilding trees and mountain-tops, stood ready
for fight. And all had their tails curled up, and all were armed with
teeth and nails, and all had chequered bodies, and all had frightful
faces. And some had the strength of ten elephants; and some had strength
ten times as much; and some of the monkey-leaders there had the strength
of a thousand elephants,--and some had the strength of numbers (of
elephants); and some had strength hundred times as much. And others had
immeasurable might. And wonderful and astonishing was their meeting. And
the concourse at that place of the monkey-forces was like the concourse
of locusts. And the air was filled up, and the earth was covered quite
with the monkeys coursing towards Lanka and dropping down into it. And
hundreds and thousands making up the army of monkeys, arrived at the
gate of Lanka; while others were pouring in from all sides for
encounter. And that mount was covered with monkeys. And a thousand
_ayutas_ were going round the city. And Lanka, blocked up everywhere
with powerful monkeys bearing trees in their hands, was incapable of
being entered even by the Wind. And the Rakshasas, sore pressed by
thousands of monkeys resembling masses of clouds, and like unto Sakra
himself in battle, were seized with amazement. And like unto the roar of
water on the ocean being riven, there arose a mighty tumult in
consequence of the forces surging hither and thither. And with that
sound the entire Lanka, with her wall and gateways, her mountains,
woods, and forests, began to shake. And that army, protected by Rama and
Lakshmana as well as Sugriva, became all the more invincible even by the
Asuras and celestials. And having arranged his forces with the view of
destroying the Rakshas, Raghava, versed in the resources of war,[117]
taking counsel of the counsellors, and deciding again and again his
course of action,--intending to adopt further measures,--resolved to
abide by the advice of Bibhishana[118], remembering the morality
regulating monarchs[119]. And then, calling Vali's son, Angada, (Rama)
said,--"O mild one, going to the Ten-necked one, tell him in my
words,--'Bounding over the deep and casting off fear and dejection, I
have laid seige to the city of Lanka; and have reft thee of thy
prosperity and thy wealth; and rendered thee moribund and senseless.
Thou hast, O night-ranger, through delusion and pride injured saints and
celestials, and Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Serpents, and Yakshas, and
crowned heads. But, O Rakshasa, thy pride begot of the boon received
from the Self-create hath gone from thee, whose destroyer,[120] I,
afflicted in consequence of my wife having been carried off,--weilding
the rod, have sat down at the door of Lanka. O Rakshasa, thou shalt,
remaining steady in fight, attain the state of celestials and Maharshis
and Rajarshis. And, O worst of Rakshasas, do thou display that prowess
of thine by which, aided by thy power of illusion, thou hast forcibly
carried off Sita, disregarding me. I shall with my sharpened shafts
render this world free from Rakshasas, unless rendering back Mithila's
daughter, thou throw thyself on my mercy. And, for certain, that
foremost of Rakshasas, the righteous and graceful Bibhishana, who hath
joined us, shall obtain, without having a thorn in his side, all this
wealth of Lanka. For thou, foolish, wicked, ignorant of self-knowledge,
and having dolts for counsellors, art not competent to unrighteously
exercise kingship for a moment. Fight thou, O Rakshasa, summoning
fortitude and heroism. On being slain with my shafts, thou shalt attain
peace.[121] O night-ranger, if thou shouldst range the three worlds in
the shape of a bird, thou, coming in my ken, shalt not be able to
preserve thy life. It is all this for thy good; do thou perform acts for
the good of thy body surviving death; and do thou see Lanka well; for
thy life is in my keeping.'" Thus addressed by Rama of untiring deeds,
Tara's son went through the welkin like the embodied bearer of
sacrificial offerings.[122] And arriving near that subduer of enemies,
Ravana, in a moment, that graceful one saw Ravana, sitting calmly in the
midst of his ministers. And dropping down in his vicinity like a flaming
fire, that best of monkeys, Angada, resembling a golden bracelet,[123]
stood there. And then introducing himself, Angada delivered unto Ravana
along with his ministers all that Rama had excellently spoken unto him,
neither extenuating nor setting down aught of himself,--"I am the envoy
of the king of Kocala--Rama of untiring deeds; and I am the son of
Vali.--I do not know whether thou hast heard of me. And Raghu's son,
Rama--enhancer of Kaucalya's joy--hath said unto thee,--'Do thou, O fell
one, coming out, give me battle and prove thy prowess. Thee shall I slay
together with thy ministers, and with thy sons and relations and
friends. And thou being slain, the three worlds shall attain peace. And
to-day shall I destroy the enemy of the gods and Danavas, and Yakshas,
of the Gandharvas, serpents and Rakshasas,--and the thorn (in the side
of) the saints. And on thee being slain, all the wealth shall be
Bibhishana's; unless, bowing down (unto me) and paying me homage, thou
render back Maithili.'" When that monkey-chief had spoken thus, the lord
of the night-rangers was wrought up with wrath. And coming under the
sway of passion, he commanded his counsellors, saying,--"Take this one
of perverse understanding, and slay him at once".

Hearing Ravana's speech, four grim-visaged night-rangers seized (Angada)
flaming in energy like fire itself. And Tara's son suffered himself to
be taken, in order that the hero might then display his prowess before
the Yatudhanas.[124] Then Angada, taking them up, who were pressed
against his arms, like insects,--leapt up on a palace resembling a hill.
Thereat, in consequence of the impetuosity of his bound, the Rakshasas,
slipping off, fell on to the ground in the very sight of the Rakshasa
king. Then the powerful son of Vali with his legs attacked the top of
that palace, elevated like a hill,[125] of the lord of Rakshasas. And
thereat, as formerly the summit of the Himavan had been cleft by the
thunderbolt, the palace, thus assailed, was split in the very presence
of the Ten-necked one. Having reft the top of the edifice, and
proclaimed his name, Angada, setting up a mighty roar, sprang into the
sky. And, aggrieving the Rakshasas and rejoicing all the monkeys, he
came back to the side of Rama in the midst of the monkeys. Ravana was
transported with wrath in consequence of the breaking down of the
palace. And, finding his destruction (at hand), he began to heave sighs.
And Rama, surrounded by innumerable delighted monkeys setting up
shouts,--anxious for slaying his foe, prepared for battle. And at the
command of Sugriva, the exceedingly powerful monkey--Sushena--resembling
a mountain-summit, surrounded by a large number of monkeys capable of
assuming shapes at pleasure, began to range from door to door;[126] like
the Moon ranging the stars. Seeing the hundred _akshauhinis_ of the
wood-rangers, stationed in Lanka, extending down to the sea, some of the
Rakshasas were struck with astonishment, while some came under the
influence of fear; and some experienced delight from the (anticipated)
delight of battle. And the space between the well and the moat all was
flooded with monkeys. And the distressed Rakshasas saw the wall
thronging with monkeys;[127] and thereat exclaiming "Alas" "Alas," the
Rakshasas were extremely terrified. And on that frightful uproar
arising, the warriors of the Rakshasa monarch,--Rakshasas--seizing
mighty arms, began to patrol about, like unto winds blowing at the time
of the universal dissolution.

SECTION XLII.


Then those Rakshasas, going to that subduer of enemies, Ravana, informed
him that Rama along with the monkeys had laid seige unto the city.
Hearing the city beseiged, the night-ranger was enraged. And, hearing
that double arrangements had been made (by Rama) in guarding the
gateways, (Ravana) ascended the palace. He saw Lanka with her hills,
woods, and forests, covered everywhere with innumerable monkeys eager
for encounter. And he saw the entire Earth tawneyed with the monkeys;
and he reflected within himself how he could destroy these. And
reflecting for long, Ravana having expansive eyes, assuming patience,
gazed at Raghava and the leader of monkeys. Raghava with his host was
fast approaching (the wall); and Ravana saw Lanka defended on all sides
by Rakshasas. And Dacaratha's son, seeing Lanka crowned with variegated
ensigns and standards, mentally went to Sita, with a sad heart. "For my
sake, here that one, Janaka's daughter, having eyes resembling those of
a young deer,--is undergoing affliction; and lieth down on the ground".
And aggrieved at the thought of Vaidehi, the righteous Rama speedily
commanded the monkeys to compass the destruction of the enemies. As Rama
of untiring deeds said this, the monkeys, filling (the air) with leonine
roars, began to press forward furiously. "We shall cleave Lanka with
mountain-peaks, or with our blows"--thus thought the leaders within
themselves. And the monkey-leaders stood, raising up gigantic
mountain-peaks and tops of mountains, and rooting up various trees. And
for doing what was dear unto Rama, that army, divided into separate
parties, in the presence of the Rakshasa-chief commenced scaling Lanka.
And those copper-faced ones of golden sheen, who had consecrated their
lives to the service of Rama, equipped with trees and rocks, began to
throng upon Lanka. And the monkeys with trees and hill-tops and blows
crushed countless gates and tops of walls; and they filled the moat
containing crystal water with dust, tops of crags, straw, and wood. Then
leaders of thousands and _kotis_ and hundreds of _kotis_ began to scale
Lanka. And the monkeys crushed golden gateways; and, breaking down gates
resembling the tops of the summits of Kailaca, bounded roaring, some
towards the wall and some all around. And resembling gigantic elephants,
they rushed towards Lanka. "Victory to the mighty Rama, and Victory to
the exceedingly powerful Lakshmana, and Victory to king Sugriva, who is
protected by Raghava". Thus shouting, those monkeys, wearing forms at
will, sending up roars, rushed amain towards the wall of Lanka. And
Viravahu, Suvahu, Nala and Panaca--leader of monkeys--breaking (a
portion of) the wall, took up their post there. In the meantime, (they)
arranged the forces in order of battle. And the strong Kumuda,
surrounded by ten _kotis_ of victorious monkeys, stood obstructing the
Eastern gate. And for backing him, there remained the monkey, Prasabha,
as also the long-armed Panaca, surrounded by monkeys. And obstructing
the Southern entrance stood the strong and gallant monkey, Satavali,
surrounded by twenty _kotis_. And the strong sire of Tara, the powerful
Sushena, obstructed the Western gate, backed by _kotis_ upon _kotis_ (of
monkeys). And obstructing the Northern gate, remained the puissant Rama
himself along with Sumitra's son, as well as the king of
monkeys--Sugriva. And that huge-bodied and dreadful Golangula--the
mighty and powerful Gavaksha--surrounded by a _koti_, remained by the
side of Rama. And that destroyer of foes--the exceedingly mighty Dhumra
of the bears of terrific wrath, remained by the side of Rama--where,
surrounded by vigilant counsellors, and bearing a mace in his hand,
stood the exceedingly strong Bibhishana, endowed with wonderful powers,
in complete panoply. And Gaya, and Gavaksha, and Gavaya, and Sarabha,
and Gandhamadana, protected the monkey-army, coursing all around. And
then, his soul wrought up with wrath, Ravana--lord of
Rakshasas--speedily ordered the whole host to sally out. Hearing those
words, which came out from Ravana's mouth, all of a sudden the
night-rangers sent up a dreadful yell. Then awoke the kettle-drums,
having moon-like pale faces,--sounded by means of golden sticks. And
conchs by hundreds and by thousands, capable of producing loud blares,
filled with air proceeding from the mouths of dreadful Rakshasas,--were
winded. And with conchs placed in their mouths, those night-rangers,
having bodies blue like those of _Cukas_, resembled masses of clouds,
with lightning and cranes. And, commanded by Ravana, the troops
cheerfully issued forth like the onrushing of the mighty main filling
all at the time of the universal dissolution. And then the monkey-army
gave a roar, spreading all around; and it seemed as if the sound filled
all Malaya with its sides and caves. And sounds of conchs, and drums, as
well as the leonine shouts of the impetuous (warriors); made the earth,
air, and ocean, resound; and these mixed with the roars of elephants,
the neighing of steeds, the rattle of the car-wheels, and the tread of
the Rakshasas' feet. And in the meantime there commenced a mighty
encounter between the Rakshasas and the monkeys, like that which took
place of yore between the gods and the Asuras. And displaying their
prowess, they[128] began to slaughter monkeys with maces, and darts, and
adzes. And the vehement monkeys (on their side) slaughtered Rakshasas
with trees and tops of crags as well as with their nails and teeth. And
a mighty sound arose of 'Victory unto king Sugriva!' and 'Victory unto
thee, O king,'--each army taking the name of its king. And then other
dreadful Rakshasas that were stationed upon the wall, dropping down,
pierced the monkeys with darts and _bhindipalas_. And (thereat) the
monkeys, flying into fury, descending to the earth and bounding, brought
down the Rakshasas with their arms. And that encounter of the Rakshasas
and the monkeys was mighty and wonderful, and the ground became wet with
flesh and gore.

SECTION XLIII.


And as the high-souled monkeys and Rakshasas fought on, their wrath
vastly increased at sight of each other's forces. And furnished with
steeds in golden trappings; and elephants resembling flames of fire; and
cars appearing like (so many) suns; and shining armour,--the valiant
Rakshasas issued, making the ten cardinal points resound. The Rakshasas
of terrific exploits were burning for victory on behalf of Ravana.--And
the mighty monkey-army also, eager for victory, darted against the host
of the Rakshas of dreadful deeds. And in the meanwhile, as either party
assailed the other, there took place single combats between the
Rakshasas and the monkeys. And as Andhaka had combated with the
Three-eyed (deity)[129] that Rakshasa, the exceedingly energetic
Indrajit, fought with Angada, son unto Vali. Sampati, hard to bear,
engaged with Prajangha; and the monkey, Hanuman, entered into conflict
with Jambumali. And Ravana's younger brother, Bibhishana, fired with
wrath, encountered Satrughna, endowed with exceeding impetuosity. And
the highly powerful Nila engaged with Nikumbha. And Sugriva--lord of
monkeys--undertook Praghasa, and the graceful Lakshmana was engaged with
Virupaksha. And the exceedingly irrepressible Agniketu and the
Rakshasa--Racmiketu--and Mitraghna and Yajnakopa, were engaged with
Rama. And Vajramubhthi encountered Mainda, and Acaniprabha, Dwivida. And
those foremost of monkeys fought with those dreadful Rakshasas,--the
heroic and terrible Pratapana, incapable of being overcome in battle,
was combating with Nala of terrific force; and that lusty son of
Righteousness, well-known as Sushena,--a mighty monkey--battled with
Vidyunmali. And other fearful monkeys encountered other Rakshasas; and
many were the encounters that took place. And great and fierce was the
engagement that took place between the heroic Rakshasas and monkeys
burning for victory, capable of making people's hair stand on end. And
from the persons of the Rakshasas and the monkeys there flowed a river
of gore, having hair for grass (growing on its banks), and the bodies of
the warriors for pieces of planks floating (adown the current).
Indrajit, growing enraged, with his mace dealt a blow at that tearer of
hostile ranks, Angada,--like him of an hundred sacrifices striking with
his thunderbolt. Thereat, that graceful monkey, Angada, gifted with
vehemence, with his mace crushed his car decked in gold, together with
the steeds and the charioteer. Sampati was pierced with three arrows by
Prajangha; and the former (in his turn) slew Prajangha on the edge of
battle with an Acwakarna.[130] And Jambumali, mounted on a car,
possessed of prodigious strength, fired with wrath, with all the access
of force derived from his car, wounded Hanuman between his paps.
Thereat, getting at his car, Hanuman--son unto the Wind-god--with a slap
speedily crushed his adversary's vehicle along with the Raksha. Then the
terrific Pratapana, roaring, rushed at Nala; and thereat Nala, with his
body pierced with sharp shafts by that swift-handed Raksha, plucked out
Pratapana's eyes, and cast them to the earth. And that lord of monkeys,
Sugriva, with a _Saptaparna_[131] swiftly slew Praghasa, who appeared to
be devouring up the troops. And, tormenting the Rakshasa of dreadful
form with a shower of shafts, Lakshmana slew Virupaksha with a single
arrow. And the irrepressible Agniketu, the Rakshasa Ragmiketu, Mitraghna
and Yajnakopa, with their arrows rendered Rama aflame. Thereat, Rama,
growing wroth, in battle severed the heads of those four by means of
four shafts, dreadful, and resembling the tongues of a flame. And
Vajramushti was slain in conflict by Mainda with a clenched fist; and
down came he to the ground along with his car and horses, like a turret
toppling (headlong). And Nikumbha in fight wounded Nila resembling a
mass of blue collyrium, with sharpened shafts,--as the Sun pierceth
clouds with his rays. Again with an hundred arrows, that light-handed
night-ranger pierced Nila in the field; and Nikumbha laughed thereat. At
this, even as Vishnu did in battle, Nila with a wheel of his[132] car,
cut off in conflict Nikumbha's head together with that of his
charioteer. And Dwivida, possessed of the touch of the Vajra and
thunder-bolt, in the presence of the entire Rakshasa host hurled a
mountain-peak at him that was endowed with the splendour of the
thunder-bolt. And Acaniprabha in encounter pierced that foremost of
monkeys, Dwivida, with shafts resembling thunder-bolts. Thereat, beside
himself with wrath, with his entire body wounded with arrows, Dwivida
with a _sala_ destroyed Acaniprabha along with his car and horses. And
Vidyunmali, mounted on a car, assailed Sushena with shafts decked with
gold, and began to shout momentarily. Seeing him mounted on his car,
Sushena--best of monkeys--taking up a huge crag, swiftly brought his car
down to the ground. Thereat, endowed with lightness, that night-ranger,
Vidyunmali, at once extricating himself from his car, stood on the
ground with a mace in his hand. Thereupon, that foremost of monkeys,
Sushena, growing furious, taking up a gigantic crag, rushed at the
night-ranger. And as he was descending, the night-ranger, Vidyunmali,
with his mace swiftly hit at the breast of Sushena--greatest of monkeys.
Thereat, without thinking at all of the terrific hit of the mace, that
best of monkeys in mighty conflict brought down that[133] upon his[134]
head. And, assailed with the crag, the night-ranger, Vidyunmali, having
his chest crushed, fell down to the earth, deprived of life. And, like
the celestials warring against the Daityas, the heroic monkeys warred on
and confounded the valiant rangers of the night. And frightful was the
field of battle, with darts, and other arms; and clubs, and javelins,
and lances, and other weapons; and with broken cars, and war-horses, and
mad horses slain, and monkeys and Rakshasas; and wheels and
_akshas_,[135] and yokes and standards,--broken and scattered over the
ground; and swarms of jackals began to range on all sides of the monkeys
and the Rakshasas; and _Kavandhas_[136] began to rise in that terrific
encounter, resembling the encounter of the gods and the Asuras. Thus
destroyed by the foremost of monkeys, the rangers of night, beyond
themselves with the smell of blood,--eagerly wishing for the setting of
the Sun,[137] again made active preparations for a renewal of the fight.

As the monkeys and the Rakshasas thus fought on, the sun set, and the
fatal Night came. And then commenced a night-engagement between the
dreadful Rakshasas and the monkeys of fixed hostility, each party
burning for victory. And in that profound darknesss, the monkeys and the
Rakshasas began to slay each other, exclaiming,--'Thou art a Rakshasa,'
and 'Thou art a monkey.' And in that army there was heard a mighty
uproar of 'slain,' 'rive!' 'come!' 'why fliest?' And, dark-hued, the
Rakshasas, equipped in golden mail, in that deep darkness appeared like
elevated hills clad with woods of flaming medicinal herbs. And in that
limitless gloom, the Rakshasas, transported with wrath, advanced with
impetuous speed, devouring monkeys. And, fired with terrible wrath,
they,[138] bounding up, with their sharp teeth tore up steeds
caparisoned in gold, and standards resembling venomous serpents. And the
lusty monkeys in battle agitated the Rakshasa host,--and, waxing
furious, with their teeth pulled and bit elephants and the riders
thereof, and cars furnished with flags and standards. And Rama and
Lakshmana with shafts resembling venomous serpents, slaughtered the
foremost among the Rakshasas--both those that were seen and those that
were not.--And the dust of the earth arising from warring combatants,
and from the hoofs of horses and the wheels of cars, choked up eye and
ear. And as the mighty encounter, capable of making people's hair stand
on end, went on, there flowed a fearful river of gore. And the sounds of
kettle-drums and _Mridangas_ and _Panavas_, mingled with those of conchs
and car-wheels,--were wonderful (to hear). And the sounds of steeds
neighing, and Rakshasas (roaring), and monkeys, rejoicing,--were
something tremendous. And, with able monkeys slain; and darts and
javelins and axes; and slaughtered Rakshasas wearing forms at pleasure,
lying mountain-like,--the field of battle, seeming to have offerings of
arms representing flowers,--became difficult to recognise, and
inaccessible; and the earth was drenched with streams of blood. And that
Night, destructive to monkeys and Rakshasas,--was dreadful, and
difficult of being out-sped by all,--like unto the Fatal Night of
beings. And in that profound darkness, the Rakshasas with great vivacity
attacked Rama with a shower of shafts. And the roars of those beings as
they advanced, sending up shouts in anger, resembled the dashing of the
Ocean at the time of the universal dissolution. And in the twinkling of
an eye, Rama by means of six shafts resembling tongues of flames, struck
six of the night-rangers; _viz_., Yajnacatru, irrepressible (in
fight),--and Mahaparcwa, and Mahodara, and the huge-bodied
Vajradanashtra,--and those two--Suka and Sarana. And, pierced in their
vitals with Rama's shafts, they, having only their lives left to them,
disappeared from the field. Then in the twinkling of an eye, that
Maharatha rendered all sides clear (of all gloom) by means of arrows
resembling tongues of fire; and those other heroic Rakshasas that were
in front of Rama, were destroyed on approaching the place, like insects
approaching a fire. And with shafts plated with gold lying in all
directions, the night resembled one in autumn decked with fireflies. And
in consequence of the uproar occasioned by the Rakshasas, and the sounds
of drums, that night, already dreadful (in itself), became all the more
so. And on that sound attaining dimensions on all sides, it seemed as if
the mount Trikuta, containing numerous caverns, had been speaking. And
huge-bodied Goangulas of equal lustre with darkness itself,[139] binding
fast the night-rangers with their arms, began to swallow them up. And
Angada was present in the encounter, for slaying foes, And Indrajit,
fairing sadly at the hands of Angada, abandoning his vehicle, and having
his horses as well as his charioteer slain, vanished then and there. And
that feat of Vali's son, worthy of being honored, all the celestials
with the saints and both Rama and Lakshmana lauded to the eight. All
beings were acquainted with the might of Indrajit in battle; and,
therefore, witnessing his discomfiture, and seeing that high-souled one,
they rejoiced exceedingly, and, seeing the enemy vanquished, all the
monkeys with Sugriva and Bibhishana, experiencing high delight,
exclaimed,--"Excellent!" "Excellent!" And, beaten by Vali's son of
dreadful deeds, Indrajit was fired with a mighty wrath. And, being
handled hard in battle, and having vanished from the field, the heroic
and wicked son of Ravana, who had received a boon from Brahma,
transported with passion,--remaining invisible, began to discharge
sharpened shafts of the splendour of the thunder-bolt. And worked up
into rage, he in the conflict pierced Raghu's sons, Rama and Lakshmana
all over their bodies, with terrific arrows consisting of serpents. And
himself engirt with illusion, that night-ranger, given to fighting in
crooked ways,--remaining invisible to all creatures,--stupified the
descendants of Raghu in battle; and by means of his shafts bound the
brothers, Rama and Lakshmana. And then in the sight of the monkeys,
those heroes and foremost of men were suddenly overpowered with shafts
by the enraged (Indrajit). And when the son of the Rakshasa monarch felt
himself incompetent to cope with them[140] openly, then that impious
one, resorting to illusion, bound those princes (by that means).

Then, anxious to ascertain his[141] course, the kings son possessed of
prowess, and endowed with exceeding strength, Rama, ordered ten of the
monkey-leaders. And that repressor of foes ordered Vali's son--Angada,
the vigorous Sarabha, Dwivida, Hanuman, the mighty Sanuprastha, Rishabha
and Rishabhaskandha. Thereat with alacrity those monkeys, weilding
mighty trees, shot up into the sky, and began to scour the ten cardinal
points. And Ravana's son, skilled in arms, resisted the impetuous march
of those vehement ones by means of a powerful weapon as well as arms
more forceful (than the force of their rush). And the exceedingly
vehement monkeys, cut and mangled with _narachas_, saw him in the dark
like the sun enveloped in clouds. And that conquerer in battle, Ravana's
son, with shafts sorely pierced the persons of Rama and Lakshmana. And
both Rama and Lakshmana had their bodies entirely covered by the angry
Indrajit with shafts turned into serpents. And from their wounds blood
began to gush out in streams; and they looked like flower-crowned
_Kincukas_. Then that one having red corners unto his eyes and
resembling a mass of crushed collyrium, Ravana's son, said unto the
brothers, as he vanished,--"When I fight remaining invisible, even
Sakra--the lord of the celestials--cannot see or approach me,--and who
are ye? And I, with my soul surcharged with wrath, shall, assailing them
with showers of weapons furnished with Kanka feathers, send Raghu's sons
to the abode of Yama". Having spoken thus unto the brothers--Rama and
Lakshmana, cognizant of righteousness--(Indrajit)--pierced them with
sharpened shafts, and shouted in joy. And stretching his large bow, that
one sable like unto a mass of crushed collyrium again discharged
terrific shafts in battle. And that one versed in the inner sense of
things, with whetted arrows pierced the vitals of Rama and Lakshmana and
shouted momentarily. And fast bound by the shackles of shafts on the
edge of battle, they[142] could not attain respite for a moment. Then
with their persons pierced with shafts and darts, and resembling the
flags of the Great Indra let loose from the cords and trembling (in the
air),--and with their bodies bristling with arrows,--those heroes and
mighty bowmen--lords of the earth--tormented in consequence of their
vitals having been pierced, dropped down to the earth. And those heroes,
bathed in blood, and their persons covered with arrows,--pained and
suffering terribly, lay down as became heroes. And there was not so much
room unpierced in their persons as could be measured by a finger; and
they were wounded with arrows up to the fore-parts of their hands.[143]
And they being wounded by that fell one capable of assuming shapes at
will, blood violently gushed out of their bodies like water from a
spring. And Rama fell first, pierced in the vitals with the shafts. And
the same Indrajit who had formerly wrathfully routed Sakra.(now) pierced
(Rama) with _narachas_ knotted with gold, and having polished heads;
swift-speeding; and resembling dust carried about by the wind; and
half-_narachas_; and darts resembling _anjalis_;[144] and
_vatsadantas_;[145] and _sinhadanshtras_;[146] and razors; and,
resigning his stringless bow decked in gold and curved in three
places,--with its part for grasping shattered--he[147] lay down like a
hero. And seeing Rama--foremost of men--down within arrow-range,
Lakshmana despaired of his life. And seeing his brother, Rama, having
eyes resembling lotus-petals and ever delighting in battle, himself the
refuge of others,--lying down in the field; (Lakshmana) began to weep.
And the monkeys also, seeing him, were plunged in sorrow; and they,
their eyes flooded with tears, began to cry in grief of heart. And when
they had been bound and had laid themselves down as become heroes, the
monkeys stood around them,--and, conversing with one another, they,
headed by the son of the Wind, were seized with extreme sorrow.

And the rangers of woods, gazing at the earth and the sky, at length
cast their eyes on the brothers--Rama and Lakshmana, covered all over
with arrows. And after that Rakshasa had gone away having performed his
work, like the God[148] going away, after having showered,--there came
to that place Bibhishana with Sugriva. And, mourning Raghu's sons, there
also came in all haste Nila and Dwivida and Mainda and Sushena and
Kumuda and Angada in company with Hanuman. And moveless; breathing
low,--covered with blood,--pierced all over with net-works of shafts;
dumb; they[149] were lying on the field. And they were sighing like
serpents; and were inert; and deprived of prowess; and washed in blood;
and looking like unto golden standards. And as they lay moveless, as
become heroes, the leaders of monkeys environed them with tear-charged
eyes. And seeing the sons of Raghu lying, covered with showers of
shafts, the monkeys, with Bibhishana, were pained (exceedingly). And the
monkeys, surveying the sky as well as all directions, could not see
Ravana's son in battle enveloped with illusion. And then Bibhishana by
means of illusion saw his brother's son staying before, hidden by
illusion. And Bibhishana saw that hero of incomparable deeds, who had no
compeer in the field and who had energy, fame and prowess,--as he
remained invisible in consequence of the Boon received from Brahma. And
Indrajit, seeing his own feat and them lying at length, spake in excess
of joy, gladdening all the Rakshasas,--"The brothers--Rama and
Lakshmana, possessed of great strength, who had slain Khara and Dushana,
are themselves slain with my shafts. And all the celestials and Asuras
assembled together with the saints, are incompetent to emancipate these
from the fetters of my shafts. He for whom my father was exercised with
anxiety and tormented by grief, for whom my sire used to spend nights
without pressing his bed,--for whom this entire Lanka had resembled a
river turbulent in the rainy reason,--that same evil sticking by the
root of all, hath been dispensed his quietus by me. And like clouds of
autumn, the prowess of Rama and Lakshmana as well as that of all the
rangers of the woods, hath been rendered useless". Saying this in the
presence of all the Rakshasas, Ravana's son--destroyer of foes--menacing
the monkey-leaders, hit Nila with nine arrows, and hurt Mainda and
Dwivida each with three powerful shafts. And piercing Jambavan with an
arrow in the chest, that mighty bowman discharged ten at Hanuman. And
Ravana's son possessed of exceeding impetuosity, pierced in the conflict
with two shafts each Gavaksha and Sarabha of immeasurable vigor. And
Ravana's son, summoning celerity, pierced the king of Golangulas and
Vali's son, Angada, with innumerable arrows. And the powerful son of
Ravana, endowed with might, piercing the foremost monkeys with shafts
resembling tongues of flames, set up shouts in the field of battle. And
tormenting the monkeys with volleys of shafts and striking terror into
them, that mighty-armed one, bursting out into a laugh, said,--"Let the
Rakshasas behold these brothers, lying fast bound with dreadful arrows,
in front of the forces". Thus addressed, those Rakshasas--wily warriors
all--resembling masses of clouds, witnessing that deed (of Indrajit),
struck with wonder and rejoicing (greatly), set up tremendous roars. And
thinking that Rama was slain, they honored Ravana's son. And seeing the
brothers--Rama and Lakshmana--motionless, and lying inert on the
ground,--they took them for slain. And, experiencing excess of joy,
Indrajit--conquerer in conflict--entered the city of Lanka, rejoicing
all the Nairitas. Seeing the bodies as well as the limbs of Rama and
Lakshmana, covered entirely with arrows, fear took possession of
Sugriva. Thereat Bibhishana said unto that lord of monkeys, staying in
woe begone guise, with a tearful countenance, and his eyes wild with
wrath,--"Do not give way to fear, O Sugriva. Restrain thy rising tears!
This is the way of warfare: victory is not (always) sure. But, O hero,
if Fortune ultimately smile upon us, this stupor shall go off from these
high-souled and exceedingly powerful ones. Therefore, O monkey, do thou
cheer me, who am forlorn". Saying this, with his hand Bibhishana washed
Sugriva's graceful eyes with water. And taking water, the righteous
Bibhishana by means of his knowledge, washed Sugriva's eyes therewith.
And washing the face of the intelligent monkey-monarch, Bibhishana spoke
these words, seasonable and sedate,--"O foremost of monkey-kings, this
is no time for being overcome with stupor. At this hour, even immoderate
affection may lead to destruction. Therefore, casting off stupor, which
tends to mar all work, do thou bethink thee how thou mayst serve this
army headed by Rama. Or do thou protect Rama so long as he doth not
regain consciousness; and when the Kakutsthas shall have regained
consciousness, all our apprehension shall vanish. This is nothing to
Rama, and Rama is not dying. And Lakshmi,[150] who is incapable of being
attained by those that are doomed, shall not forsake this one. Therefore
do thou comfort thyself, do thou also cheer up thy own forces,--while I
am engaged in composing all the troops. O best of monkeys, these with
distended eyes, come under the governance of terror, are, stricken with
panic, whispering into each other's ears. But seeing me, let the forces
rushing about, cheered up,--as well as the monkeys,--cast off all fear,
like a wreath that hath been used before". Thus comforting Sugriva,
Bibhishana--lord of Rakshasas--again instilled spirits into the flying
forces of monkeys. And Indrajit--worker of mighty illusions--accompanied
by his troops, entered the city of Lanka and presented himself before
his father. And approaching Ravana and saluting him with joined hands,
he informed his sire of the welcome tidings that Rama and Lakshmana had
been slain. And hearing that his foe had fallen, Ravana springing up in
the midst of the Rakshasas, with great joy embraced his son. And
scenting the crown of his head, (Ravana) with a delighted heart, asked
(Indrajit as to all that had taken place). And on being asked, he
(Indrajit) truly related unto his sire how (Rama and Lakshmana) had been
rendered senseless and lack-lustre by being fastened with shafts.
Thereat, with rapture surcharging his inmost soul, Ravana, hearing the
speech of the mighty car-warrior, banished his fear of Dacaratha's
son,--and rising up, honored his son with glad words.

When Ravana's son entered Lanka, after having accomplished his purpose,
the foremost monkeys protected Raghava, surrounding him on all sides.
And Hanuman, and Angada, and Nila, and Sushena, and Kumuda, and Nala,
and Gaya, and Gavaksha, and Panasa, and Samprastha--a mighty monkey--and
Jambavan, and Rishava, and Sunda, and Rambha, and Satavali, and
Prithu,--all forming themselves into array, and equipped with trees on
all sides, and remaining vigilant,--the monkeys kept gazing at all
sides, awry and upwards; and even when a straw stirred, they thought it
to be a Rakshasa. And Ravana, on his part, experiencing the height of
exaltation, summoned the Rakshasis engaged in guarding Sita.--And
thereat the Rakshasis--Trijata and others--presented themselves at his
command. And then the lord of Rakshasas, delighted, addressed then the
Rakshasis, saying,--"Tell Vaidehi that Rama and Lakshmana have been
slain in battle by Indrajit. And taking her on Pushaka, show her (Rama
and Lakshmana) lying slain on the field of battle. That one depending on
whom she had proudly set her face against me,--that husband of hers,
along with his brother, hath been slain in conflict. And then Mithila's
daughter, her fear gone off with her anxiety, and herself losing all
support,--Sita--daughter unto Mithila--decked out in all ornaments,
shall seek me. And today beholding Rama with Lakshmana, come under the
sway of Time, she, finding no other way, shall desist from her present
course. And seeing no other resourse, that one of expansive eyes shall
of herself seek me". Hearing those words of the wicked-minded Ravana,
the Rakshasis, saying,--"So be it,"--went to where Pushpaka was. Then
taking Pushpaka, the Rakshasis at Ravana's command went to Maithili
staying in the _acoka_ wood. Then, taking Sita, who was overcome with
grief for her lord, the Rakshasis, placed her on the car, Pushpaka. And
placing Sita on Pushpaka along with Trijata, Ravana took her all around
(Lanka) crowded with ensigns and standards. And the lord of Rakshasas
jubilantly proclaimed in Lanka,--"Raghava as well as Lakshmana have been
slain by Indrajit in battle". And going about with Trijata, Sita saw all
the monkey-troops slain. And she found the flesh-eaters elated in
spirits, and the monkeys afflicted with extreme grief at the side of
Rama and Lakshmana. Then Sita beheld both Lakshmana and Rama lying in
the field, senseless and bound with arrows. And those heroes were lying
on the earth, their mail torn, their bows cast off, their bodies mangled
all over and thickly pierced with shafts. And seeing those
brothers,--foremost of heroes and best of men--having eyes resembling
white lotuses, and themselves like unto Kumaras,--lying in the
field,[151]--the fire-sprung one, Sita, striken with grief, began to
weep piteously. And that black-eyed one of an excellent person, Janaka's
daughter--seeing them roll in the dust, broke out into lamentation. And
with her eyes shedding plentiful tears, she seeing those brothers,
endowed with god-like prowess, concluded them to be dead $ and
overwhelmed with grief, spoke as follows.

SECTION XLVIII.


And seeing her husband, as well as the exceedingly powerful
Lakshmana,--slain, Sita, afflicted with grief, burst into bitter
lamentation. "The soothsayers had said that I should have sons, and
should never be a widow. But on Rama being slain, it seems now that
those ones, possessed of knowledge, had spoken untruthfully. And those
also, who having celebrated sacrifices and rites, had said that I should
become the queen (of Rama),--on Rama being slain, seems to-day to have
spoken a falsehood, although they are possessed of knowledge. And they
also asserted that I should be honored of the wives of heroic kings as
well as of my lord,--but on Rama being slain, they seem to have uttered
a falsehood, although possessed of knowledge. And those twice-born ones
that in my hearing had said auspicious words, on Rama being slain, seem
to-day to have spoken a falsehood, although they were possessed of
knowledge. These lotus-marks on the feet, betokening unto gentlewomen
possessing them, that they are to be installed in the kingdom in company
with their husbands--who are kings,--are on me. And those marks find I
none on me by which women of rare fortune come by widowhood,--but I find
that in me these good tokens are nullified. Those marks that are
pronounced infallible by those versed in such knowledge, on Rama being
slain, are nullified in me. My hairs are fine, equal, and blue; my
eye-brows touch each other; my hips are devoid of down and round; and my
teeth are close. My temples, and eyes, hands, feet, ankles, and thighs
are equal. And my fingers are furnished with round nails, and are plump
and even in the middle. And my breasts are close and firm and developed,
and have their nipples sunk. And my navel is depressed, with high sides.
And my chest is swelling. And my complexion is like the hue of
gems,--and my down soft. And they said that I was furnished with twelve
auspicious signs. And my hands in the middle parts of my fingers contain
wheat-marks; and in the spaces between the fingers, have no uneven
corners. And my feet also partake of the general complexion. And my
laugh is a gentle smile. And those versed in marks of women knew that I
was possessed of such marks. And those Brahmanas skilled in telling
fortune said that I should be installed in the kingdom along with my
husband; but all that hath been falsified. Having purified Janasthana
(of Rakshasas), obtained tidings of me, and crossed the Ocean[152]
incapable of being Agitated, those brothers have been slain in the
footprint of a cow! The descendants of Raghu had obtained Varuua and
Agneya and Aindra and Vayava and _Brahmaciras_ weapons.[153] Through
illusion have those lords of me, who am forlorn--Rama and Lakshmana,
resembling Vasava himself in battle,--been slain. Coming in battle
within ken of Raghava, a foe, even if he be endowed with the fleetness
of thought,--doth not go back, living. There is nothing which is too
hard for Time; and the Destroyer is incapable of being overcome;
inasmuch as Rama along with his brother Lakshmana hath fallen in fight.
And I do not so much mourn Rama or the mighty
car-warrior--Lakshmana--or, for that matter, self,--as I do the wretched
Mother-in-law of mine. She ever thinketh of the period of the promise.
'When shall I behold Sita and Lakshmana with Raghava?'" As she was thus
lamenting, the Rakshasi, Trijata, said,--"O exalted lady, do not weep
thus. Thy lord liveth. And, O dignified one, I shall unfold unto thee
potent and probable reasons why the brothers Rama and Lakshmana live.
When their leader falleth, the countenances of the warriors in battle
are not overspread with passion, or display cheerfulness and vivacity.
And, O Vaidehi, if those had lost their lives, this celestial chariot,
named Pushpaka, would not have held thee. An army that hath its heroes
and chiefs slain--becoming dispirited and drooping, rangeth the field,
like a vessel on water that hath lost its helmsman. But, O lorn one,
these troops, betraying neither agitation nor anxiety, are guarding the
Kakutsthas. This I tell thee of them out of affection. Do thou, at this
conclusion bringing in joy, take comfort; and behold the Kakutsthas
unslain. This I tell thee from affection. I never told thee untruths
heretofore; nor, O Mithila's daughter, will I tell them unto thee now.
Thou by virtue of thy character conducive to delight, hast found an
access into my heart. These even the celestials and Asuras with Indra
(at their head) are incompetent to quell. Seeing such sight, I speak to
thee as to their being alive. And behold, O Maithili, this mighty
wonder! These are lying insensible with arrows; but of those Grace hath
not taken leave. It generally happens that the faces of persons dead and
gone, are unsightly to a degree. Therefore, O Janaka's daughter, leave
off grief and sorrow and stupor. For the sake of Rama and Lakshmana thou
canst not today put a period to thy existence". Hearing her words,
Mithila's daughter--Sita--resembling the daughter of a celestial, with
hands joined, said,--"May this be so!" Then turning away the car
Pushpaka fleet as the mind, the distressed Sita entered Lanka along with
Trijata. Then in company with Trijata, alighting from Pushpaka, she
along with the Rakshasis entered the _acoka_ wood. And entering that
sporting-ground of the Rakshasa lord abounding in woody tracts, Sita,
having beheld those princes and reflected on them, became subject to a
mighty grief.

SECTION XLIX.


Bound up terribly with shafts, Dacaratha's sons, lying down bathed in
blood, sighed hard like unto serpents. And all those foremost monkeys,
along with Sugriva, possessed of exceeding strength,--overwhelmed with
sorrow, remained surrounding those high-souled ones. In the meanwhile,
the powerful Rama, albeit fast bound by the shafts, awoke by virtue of
the exceeding toughness of his person, as well as his might. Then,
seeing his brother, having a distressful countenance, covered with
blood, feeble, and fast bound by the shafts,--Rama, greatly aggrieved,
began to mourn. "Of what use unto me is the recovery of Sita, or life
either, when to-day I see my brother vanquished in fight and lying down
in the field? Seeking in the world (of men), I may light upon a woman
like Sita; but never on a brother, or a helper, or a warrior like unto
Lakshmana. If that enhancer of Sumitra's joy have met with his end, my
life I must renounce in the sight of the monkeys. What shall I say unto
Kaucalya: and what shall I say unto Kaikeyi? And what shall I say unto
mother Sumitra, eager for a sight of her son? And if I go (back) without
him, how shall I soothe her, like unto a cow reft of her calf; and
trembling; and resembling a mourning Kurari? And how shall I say unto
Satrughana and the illustrious Bharata,--'He went with me to the forest;
but I come (back) here without him?' I shall not be able to bear the
rebuke of mother Sumitra. Therefore even here shall I renounce my
person; for certainly I dare not live. Fie on me, who am wicked and
base; for me this Lakshmana, brought down, lieth in the field of battle,
like one that is without life. O Lakshmana, thou ever comfortest me when
I am dispirited. But to day, having lost thy life, thou canst not speak
to me, who am afflicted. Thou, O hero, who hadst in battle slain
innumerable Rakshasas lying around, hast (at length) thyself been slain
in the field with shafts. And lying down in the battle-field, bleeding,
and covered with arrows, thou appearest like the Sun when he hath gone
up the Setting-hill. And in consequence of shafts piercing thy vitals,
thou canst not speak; but thy visible expression, albeit thou art dumb,
betokens pain. O thou endowed with exceeding splendour, even as thou
didst follow me into the forest, will I follow thee unto the mansion of
Yama. Thou, having dear friends, and ever following me, hast come by
this plight in consequence of my reprehensible conduct. I do not
remember having heard any harsh speech from the heroic Lakshmana, even
when he had happened to be exceedingly wroth. He that could discharge at
one shot five hundred shafts,--that Lakshmana is superior to
Karttaviryya himself in that weapon--the bow. He that with his arms
could resist the arms of Sakra himself,--that one worthy of a costly
couch--lieth down on the ground, slain. And that false babble shall now,
without doubt, consume me; for by me hath not Bibhishana been made
monarch of the Rakshasas. Do thou, O Sugriva, this very moment retrace
thy steps. Bereft of thy strength through me, thou wilt be worsted by
Ravana. And, O Sugriva, placing Angada to the fore, do thou, taking thy
host as well as the equipage, in company with Nila and Nala, cross over
the Ocean. By thee hath been achieved a mighty feat incapable of being
done by another in battle. And pleased am I with the king of bears, and
the lord of Golangulas; and Angada hath quit himself nobly, as also
Mainda and Dwivida. And Kecarin and Sampati have both fought terribly.
And Gavaya, and Gavaksha, and Sarabha, and Gaja,--and other monkeys have
fought as others are incapable of fighting,--determined to lay down
their lives (for me). But, O Sugriva, man cannot overrule Destiny. Thou,
my friend, fearing righteousness,[154] hast done what lay in thy power.
And, Ye foremost of monkeys, ye also have acted as becometh friends.
Now, with my permission, go ye whithersoever ye are minded". Hearing
Rama's lament, the monkeys--those dark-eyed and others--began to shed
tears from their eyes. Then Bibhishana, quieting the army, taking a mace
in his hand, swiftly went to where Raghava was. And seeing him fast
making his way, resembling a mass of dark collyrium, the monkeys taking
him to be Ravana's son,[155] began to run away.

[154] _Dharma-bhiru--fearing righteousness_--is the epithet generally
      applied to persons fearing not in fact _righteousness_, but
      unrighteousness. This may be taken as an _idiotism_ in
      Sanskrit.--T.

[155] Indrajit. Such was the fear he had spread by his redoubtable
      deeds!--T.



SECTION L.


Then out spake the highly energetic and exceedingly mighty king of
monkeys,--"Why is this host agitated like a bark driven hither and
thither by the wind?" Hearing Sugriva's speech, Vali's son said,--"Dost
thou not see both those heroes--sons of Dacaratha:--Rama and that mighty
car-warrior--Lakshmana--covered with arrows? And (dost thou not see)
those high-souled ones lying in the field of battle, covered with
blood?" Thereat, the lord of monkeys, Sugriva, spake unto his son,[156]
Angada--"I do not deem it without cause. This may have come to pass
through sheer fear. These monkeys with sad faces, leaving their arms
behind them, are flying in all directions, their eyes distended in
affright. And they are not ashamed of each other, and they do not cast
their looks back. And they hug each other, and go leaping over the
fallen". In the meanwhile, that hero, Bibhishana, bearing a mace in his
hand, (approaching), greeted Sugriva as well as Raghava with blessings
of victory. And Sugriva, seeing Bibhishana, capable of inspiring fear in
the monkeys, spoke unto the high-souled sovereign of bears, who stood
by,--"This is Bibhishana that hath come hither, seeing whom the foremost
among the monkeys, from fear of Ravana's son who, they apprehend, he
is,--are fleeing away, seized with a panic. Do thou at once stay these
agitated with fear and scampering all around; and proclaim,--'This is
_Bibhishana_, who hath come here.'" Thus directed, Jambavan--king of
bears--restraining those that were flying, composed the monkeys. Hearing
the bear-king's words, and seeing Bibhishana, the monkeys, renouncing
fear, desisted (from their flight). Then the righteous Bibhishana,
viewing Rama's as well as Lakshmana's body pierced with arrows, was
exceedingly aggrieved. And washing their eyes with water, he, with his
mind overpowered with grief, began to weep and broke out into
lamentation,--"The Rakshasas, fighting in wily ways, have brought to
this pass these ones endowed with prowess and possessed of every
perfection and gifted with might (of arm). And with his guileful mind,
that brother's son of mine, wicked-souled and an evil son (unto
me),--hath deceived these ones of straight prowess. Pierced with
innumerable shafts, and covered with blood, these are lying on the
ground like Salyakas[157]. Those depending on whose prowess, I had
sought eminence, those foremost of men, sleep here soundly for
renouncing their bodies. Living, today I am in distress: and my desire
of dominion is annihilated; and my foe, Ravana, hath his promise
fulfilled and his aim crowned with success". As Bibhishana was thus
lamenting, the lord of monkeys--Sugriva--endowed with strength,
embracing him, spoke unto him,--"O thou cognisant of righteousness, thou
wilt herein Lanka obtain empire: no doubt of this; and Ravana along with
his sons will be disappointed in their expectations. Both these--Rama
and Lakshmana--are under the _aegis_ of Garuda; and, casting off their
stupor: they will in battle slay Ravana along with his adherents".
Having thus soothed and comforted the Rakshasa, Sugriva addressed his
father-in-law, who was at his side, saying,--"Do thou along with numbers
of heroic monkeys, taking those repressors of foes, the brothers--Rama
and Lakshmana--when they shall have regained their consciousness, repair
to Kishkindha. And I, slaying Ravana along with his sons and friends,
shall bring back Mithila's daughter, even as Sakra recovered the lost
Sri". Hearing the words of the monkey-king, Sushena said,--"I had
witnessed the war of yore between the gods and the Asuras. Then the
Danavas, enveloping themselves, momentarily destroyed the deities,
albeit versed in arms and accomplished in weapons. And they, their
senses lost, and their lives departed, Vrihashpati treated by means of
his knowledge of _mantras_, as well with medicines. Let Sampati, Panaca,
and other monkeys speedily hie to the Milky Ocean for the purpose of
bringing those medicines. And the monkeys well know that mighty
mountainous medicine--divine and capable of reviving the dead,--and made
by the deities themselves--_vicalya_. There are (the mountains) named
Chandra and Drona: where the ambrosia was churned, there is that supreme
drug. And those mountains have been placed by the deities in the mighty
deep. And, O king, let the son of the Wind-god go thither". In the
meanwhile, the wind arose, and masses of clouds appeared along with
lightning. And the wind blew, agitating the waters of the deep, and
shaking the mountains. And mighty trees of the ocean-islands, broken
down by the terrible wing-raised wind, began to topple headlong into the
salt waters. And the serpents dwelling there were seized with affright;
and speedily all the aquatic animals dived deep into the salt sea. And
then in a moment the monkeys saw Vinata's son, possessed of terrific
strength,--like unto a flaming fire. And seeing him come, the serpents
began to dart away,--those exceedingly powerful ones that, turning into
shafts, had bound those persons.[158] Then, touching the Kakutsthas and
saluting them, Suparna rubbed with his hands their countenances
furnished with the splendour of the Moon. And their wounds, on being
touched by Vinata's son, were (immediately) healed; and the bodies of
both speedily became cool and shone with an excellent complexion. And
they attained immense energy and prowess; and a double share of
strength, and of rational and perceptive powers, and of memory. And then
raising them up, the exceedingly energetic Garuda, resembling Vasava
himself, embraced both joyfully. And then Rama addressed (Garuda),
saying,--"By thy grace we have through means survived the mighty
calamity that had sprung from Ravana's son; and we have also speedily
been rendered strong. And my heart is delighted on having thee, like
unto my father, Dacaratha, or my grand sire, Aja. Who art thou,
furnished with beauty, and bearing wreaths and unguents (on thy person);
clad in stainless attire; and adorned in noble ornaments?" Unto him
spake the exceedingly energetic son of Vinata endowed with great
strength,--the lord of birds, with a pleased heart, and his eyes wild
with glee,--"O Kakutstha, I am thy friend--thy life ranging
externally--Garutman. I am come hither for aiding you. Neither the
highly powerful Asuras, nor the exceedingly strong monkeys, nor the
celestials along with the Gandharbas, having him of an hundred
sacrifices at their head are,--capable of delivering (any one) from
these dreadful arrowy bonds, which had been forged by Indrajit of
tortuous deeds by help of illusion. These serpents--offspring of
Kadru--are sharp-fanged and venomous; and had bound thee as arrows
through the potency of illusion. O Rama having truth for prowess, thou
art fortunate,--along with that destroyer of foe in fight, Lakshmana.
Hearing this, I, summoning energy, have come hither swiftly. And I,
doing by thee as a friend, have from affection at once set you free from
these dreadful arrowy bonds. But thou shouldst always be on thy guard.
By nature the Rakshasas have cunning shifts in fight and thou, who art
heroic and of a pure spirit, canst but rely on thy simplicity alone for
strength. Therefore thou must not trust the Rakshasas in the field of
battle. By this one instance (thou must know; that Rakshasas are ever
deceitful in fight". Having said this, the wondrous mighty Suparna,
embracing Rama) tenderly (again), said,--"My friend Raghava, O thou who
even cherishest affection for thy foes, permit me thou. I shall go at
pleasure. And, O Raghava, entertain no curiosity as to our
friendship.[159] When, O hero, thou shalt have achieved success in
battle, thou shalt know all about this friendship of ours. And with the
surges of thy shafts, making Lanka contain only children and aged, and
slaying thy foe, Ravana, thou shalt recover Sita". Having spoken thus,
Suparna, endowed with fleet vigor, having rendered Rama hale in the
midst of the monkeys,--having gone round them and embraced them
also,--that one possessed of prowess,--set out, covering up the sky,
like unto the wind. And seeing Raghu's sons rendered hale, the
monkey-leaders set up leonine roars, and began to flourish their tails.
And then beat the kettle-drums and the drums struck up. And conchs were
cheerfully blown; and shouts were sent. And others struck at their arms
with their hands. And the monkeys, accustomed to battle with trees,
uprooting them, stood by hundreds and thousands. And emitting tremendous
roars and thereby frightening the night-rangers, the monkeys, eager for
encounter, approached the gate of Lanka. And that mighty and dreadful
din raised by the monkeys, resembled the terrible rumbling of the clouds
at midnight about the end of Summer.

SECTION LI.


Then Ravana heard the tumult raised by the highly energetic monkeys
roaring in company with the Rakshasas. And hearing that low and solemn
noise--that prodigious uproar--Ravana said in the midst of his
counsellors,--"From mighty roars that are heard of in innumerous
delighted monkeys,--resembling the roar of clouds,--it is evident,
beyond a doubt, that there is great rejoicing there. And the salt Ocean
is vexed with these thundering noises. The brothers--Rama and
Lakshmana--have been fast bound with sharp shafts; and here this uproar
is exciting my alarm". Having spoken thus unto his ministers, the lord
of the Rakshasas addressed the Nairitas present there, saying,--"Do you
speedily acquaint yourselves with the cause of rejoicing that hath
arisen of these monkeys on this mournful occasion". Thus accosted, they
hurriedly mounting up on the wall, surveyed the forces maintained by the
high-souled Sugriva as well as those exalted ones--Raghu's sons--
emancipated from their terrific arrowy fetters and arisen (now)".
Thereat, with their hearts wrought up, grim-visaged Rakshasas descending
from the wall, appeared before the Rakshasa-lord with pale faces. And
then with woe-begone faces, those Rakshasas, skilled in speech,
faithfully informed Ravana in full of that unfortunate circumstance.
"Those brothers--Rama and Lakshmana--who had in battle been bound up in
arrowy fetters by Indrajit,--and whose arms lay moveless,--having been
emancipated from the arrowy bonds, are seen in the field of battle; and
those ones like unto the foremost of elephants in strength, seem like
elephants that have snapped their fetters". Hearing those words of
theirs, the exeedingly powerful lord of the Rakshasas was wrought up
with anxiety and anger, and his countenance lost its complexion.
"Indrajit, having routed them in conflict, had bound them by means of
irrisistible and terrible arrows, resembling venomous serpents, and like
unto the Sun himself,--which had been conferred on (Indrajit) as boons.
But if my enemy, having actually been bound by the weapons, can have
been liberated, all this strength of mine I see placed in peril. And
those shafts resembling Fire in fierceness, which had in battle deprived
my foes of their lives,--have forsooth been rendered fruitless". Having
said this in high rage, Ravana, sighing like a serpent, addressed a
Rakshasa, named Dhumraksha, seated in the midst of the Rakshasas,--"O
thou of dreadful prowess, surrounded by a mighty force, do thou march
forth to compass the destruction of Rama along with the monkeys". Thus
accosted by the intelligent lord of the Rakshasas, Dhumraksha, turning
about, issued out of the abode of the king. And speedily sallying forth
from the gate of (Ravana's) residence, he said unto the general of the
forces,--"Do thou speedily move off thy forces. Why should a warrior
linger?" Hearing Dhumraksha's words, the general of the forces,
following them, at the command of Ravana forthwith made the army ready.
And those powerful and dreadful night-rangers, bursting with high
spirits,--with bells tied to their arms,--set up shouts, and surrounded
Dhumraksha. And bearing various weapons in their hands, and wielding
darts and clubs, and equipped with maces and bearded darts and rods and
iron bludgeons and _parighas_ and _bhindipalas_ and lances and nooses
and axes,--those terrific Rakshasas sallied out, roaring like unto
clouds. And others, accoutred in armour, with cars; adorned with
banners; furnished with golden networks, and mules having various faces,
and extremely swift steeds, and lusty elephants in rut,--tiger-like
Nairitas incapable of being subdued, even as tigers--sallied out
(thereafter). And then Dhumraksha himself ascended a superb car, bearing
faces of deer and lions decked with gold,--and sending forth a loud
clatter. And the highly powerful Dhumraksha, surrounded by Rakshasas,
cheerfully issued out of the Western Entrance, where Hanuman was posted.
And thereat, fell fowls of the air forbade that exceedingly dreadful
Rakshasa of a fearful form, as he went out ascending an excellent car,
yoked with mules, and sending sharp sounds. And an exceedingly terrific
vulture alighted at the crest of the car; and forming themselves into
lines, vultures began to drop down about the top of the banner. And
emitting a frightful cry, (a headless trunk) dropped down before
Dhumraksha. And that god[160] showered down blood; and the earth shook.
And the wind blew awry with a sound resembling thunder. And every side,
covered with darkness, appeared dim. And witnessing those dreadful
inauspicious omens at the outset, fraught with fear unto the Rakshasas,
Dhumraksha was greatly aggrieved; and the Rakshasas marching before him,
were stupified. And then as that strong and fearful one, eager for
encounter, surrounded, by innumerable night rangers, issued out (of the
city), he beheld that monkey-host, protected by the arm of
Raghava,--resembling the deep at the time of the universal dissolution.

[160] Indra--cloud-compeller.



SECTION LII.


Seeing the Rakshasa--Dhumraksha of dreadful prowess--issue out, the
monkeys, rejoicing greatly, eager for encounter, set up roars. And then
there took place a terrific conflict between the monkeys and the
Rakshasas, charging each other with fearful trees, and darts, and maces.
And the Rakshasas began to scatter the dreadful monkeys on all sides;
and the monkeys (on their part) felled the Rakshasas with trees. And the
Rakshasas, growing enraged, began to pierce the monkeys with straight
speeding sharp shafts winged with Kanka plumes. And riven by the Rakshas
with dreadful clubs and bearded darts, daggers and maces and terrible
and curious bludgeons and grasped javelins,--the exceedingly powerful
(monkeys), their anger aroused, began with alacrity to perform deeds of
intrepid valour. And those monkey-leaders, their bodies pierced with
shafts and their persons riven with darts, took up trees and crags. And
those monkeys, endowed with terrific vehemence, sending up shouts, and
proclaiming their respective names, set about tossing the brave Rakshasa
ranks. And that conflict between the Rakshasas and the monkeys, waged
with diverse rocks and innumerable trees, waxed exceedingly furious. And
some among the Rakshasas feeding on gore--on being agitated by the
monkeys burning for victory,--began to vomit blood. And some were
severed along their flanks; and, some, slain with trees, were heaped up;
and some were crushed with crags; and some were torn with teeth. And
some being broken down by means of broken standards, and some by means
of fallen swords, and some crushed down by cars,--the rangers of the
night suffered sorely. And (anon) the earth was covered with huge
elephants measuring mountains, and mountain-tops, and steeds crushed,
and the riders thereof,--all borne down by the monkeys. And bounding
again and again, the vehement monkeys endowed with terrific prowess,
with their finger-nails tore up the Rakshasas by the mouths. And with
woe-begone faces, and with hair dishevelled, (the Rakshasas), stupified
with the smell of blood, saught the earth. And other Rakshasas endowed
with dreadful vigor, waxing wondrous wroth, dealt the monkeys slaps with
hands having the touch of the thunder-bolt. And, gifted with greater
impetuosity, the monkeys felled the impetuous (Rakshasas) with blows,
and feet and teeth; and some were slain with trees. And seeing the
forces fleeing away, that foremost of Rakshasas--Dhumraksha--flying into
fury, began a terrific conflict with the monkeys desirous of encounter.
And some of the monkeys, sore assailed with _pracas_, began to bleed;
and some, wounded with maces, dropped down to the ground. And some were
beaten hard with bludgeons; and some were cleft with _bhindipalas_. And
some, on being assailed with bearded darts, became insensible and lost
their lives. And some among the monkeys lay slain on the ground,
drenched in blood. And some, fleeing away from the field, were
slaughtered by the infuriated Rakshasas. And some, having their breasts
pierced, lay on their sides. And some were riven with tridents; and the
entrails of some had come out. And that mighty and dreadful encounter of
the Rakshasas and the monkeys, was waged with countless weapons and
rocks and trees. And that battle became a musical entertainment[161]
mellifluous with bow-string for _Vina_,[162] having the neighing of
chargers for its measure, and with the cries of _Maindas_[163] for its
strains. Then in the field, Dhumraksha bow in hand, laughing, pursued
the monkeys in all directions with showers of shafts. And seeing the
forces hard beset by Dhumraksha and distressed thereat, the Wind-god's
offspring, waxing enraged, seizing a huge crag, approached (the
Rakshasa). And with his eyes doubly reddened in wrath, that one, like
unto his sire himself in prowess, brought down the crag upon
Dhumraksha's car. And seeing the crag, (Dhumraksha) upraising his mace
hurriedly, leapt down in vehemence, and stood on the ground. And having
shattered his car, that crag fell down to the earth. And thereat letting
go the car furnished with wheels, _Kuvaras_ and a face, as well as a
banner; in which Dhumraksha had left his bow,--Hanuman--son unto the
Wind-god--laid about him right lustily for destroying the Rakshasas,
with trees having branches long and short. And thereat some Rakshasas
with their heads shattered, lay drenched in blood; and others, struck
with trees, dropped down to the earth. And then Hanuman--son unto the
Wind-god--charged in full career against the Rakshasa army; and, taking
a mountain-peak, he rushed against Dhumraksha. And as Hanuman was
descending, the powerful Dhumraksha, upraising a mace, and giving out a
shout, made towards him speedily. And then Dhumraksha enraged, brought
down that mace studded with innumerable pricks, on the head of Hanuman
fired with wrath. And thus assailed with the mace of fearful
impetuosity! the monkey endowed with the strength of the wind, without
at all heeding that blow, let fall a mountain-top right against
Dhumraksha's head. And on being assailed with the mountain-peak,
Dhumraksha, having his entire body mangled, suddenly fell to the earth,
like unto a toppling hill. And seeing Dhumraksha slain, those
night-rangers that survived the carnage, in extreme agitation began to
pour into Lanka, attacked by the monkeys. And that high-souled offspring
of the Wind-god, having slain his foes, and come under the influence of
fatigue incident to his slaughtering his enemies,--having caused rivers
of gore to flow (in the field),--experienced the excess of joy on being
honored of the monkeys.

SECTION LIII.


Hearing Dhumraksha slain, Ravana--lord of the Rakshasas--overwhelmed
with a mighty rage, began to sigh like a serpent. And collied with
passion, and sighing hot for a long time, he addressed a cruel
Rakshasa--the exceedingly strong Vajradanshtra,[164]--"Go thou, O hero.
Go out, environed by the Rakshasas. Slay Dacaratha's son--Rama--and
Sugriva along with the monkeys". Thereupon hastily answering "So be it,"
that foremost of the Rakshasas skilled in illusion, marched forth
surrounded by many a leader[165] of armies, furnished with elephants and
steeds, mules and camels,--with his mind concentrated; and adorned with
innumerable variegated flags and banners. And then decked out with
curious _keyuras_ and a tiara, and wearing armour, he rushed out with
his bow in his hand. And then going round his flaming vehicle, adorned
with pennons and garnished with gold, the king[166] ascended the same.
And equipped with slender swords and curious _tomaras_ and smooth maces
and _bhindipalas_ and bows and darts and _patticas_ and scimitars and
discuses and clubs and sharpened axes, the multiform infantry march
bearing arms in their hands. And all those powerful and flaming
Rakshasas wore variegated raiments. And heroic elephants in rut
resembling mountains in motion, marched, being led by those well-skilled
in battle carrying _tomaras_ and hooks in their hands. And mighty steeds
bearing auspicious marks, marched, ridden by heroes. And that entire
Rakshasa army, as it marched forth, resembled clouds in summer roaring
with lightning. And (the Rakshasas) sallied forth through the Southern
Entrance, where that leader of herds--Angada--was stationed. And as they
went out, evil omens appeared. From the cloudless yet fierce sky meteors
began to shoot. And throwing up flames from their mouths, dreadful
jackals began to emit cries. And frightened beasts betokened the
destruction of the Rakshasas in battle, And warriors began to tumble
down in an ominous way. Witnessing these evil omens, the exceedingly
powerful and energetic Vajradanshtra, assuming patience, set out, eager
for encounter. And seeing them flee away, the monkeys, yearning for
victory, set up tremendous shouts, filling all the cardinal points. And
then there came on a terrific encounter of the monkeys and the
Rakshasas, dreadful, of terrific deeds, and wishing for each other's
death. And warriors fraught with high spirits, springing up, dropped
down to the earth, their bodies and hands riven, and all their persons
bathed in blood. And some approaching each other, with bludgeons in
their hands, without turning away from the field, discharged various
weapons at each other. And there were heard sounds of trees and rocks
and weapons,--mighty and dreadful and capable of striking terror into
the heart. And dreadful and mighty were the sounds of car-wheels, and
conchs and trumpets and drums. And some, casting off weapons, engaged in
a hand to hand combat by means of slaps, and kicks, and bones, and
trees. And some Rakshasas, having their bodies broken, were killed by
means of thighs, and some were crushed with crags by Danavas invincible
in battle. And Vajradanshtra, resembling the noose-handed destroyer,
frightening the monkeys, ranged in that field fatal to people. And
Rakshasas, possessed of strength; equipped with various weapons,
transported with passion, slew the monkey-forces. And then in the
conflict the proud Wind-god's son, influenced by twofold wrath, spread
havoc among the Rakshasa ranks, like the Fire at the universal
dissolution. And the energetic Angada possessed of the prowess of a
lion, with his eyes coppery with wrath, upraising a tree, began to
spread terrible destruction among the Rakshasas, even as a lion
destroyeth tiny deer. And attacked by Angada there, the Rakshasas of
dreadful vigor, with their heads riven, fell down like unto trees that
have been uprooted. And the earth became frightful (to behold), being
covered with variegated cars and standards and steeds and the bodies of
monkeys and of Rakshasas and streams of blood. And adorned with chains,
and _Keyuras_, and attires, and umbrellas, the field of battle looked
like an autumnal night. And agitated by Angada's impetuosity, that
mighty army of Rakshasas began to shake, even as water trembleth, moved
by the wind.

SECTION LIV.


Finding his own army destroyed by the might of Angada, the exceedingly
powerful Rakshasa--Vajradanshtra--was overcome with rage. And stretching
his dreadful bow of the splendour of Sakra's thunder-bolt, he began to
shower shafts among the monkey-ranks. And the foremost among the heroic
Rakshasas also, stationed on cars, furnished with various arms, warred
on in the encounter. And the heroic monkeys also--foremost of their
kind--with rocks in their hands, fought around in united strength. And
in that conflict, the Rakshasas began to incessantly shower _ayutas_
among the flower of the monkey-army. And the monkeys,--pre-eminently
valiant, and resembling mad elephants, kept showering over the Rakshasas
mountain-trees and mighty rocks. And then took place a hot contest among
heroic warring monkeys and Rakshasas, eager for encounter. And some,
with their heads unbroken, had their arms and legs torn; and their
bodies pierced with weapons, and laved with blood. And monkeys and
Rakshasas lay down in the dirt,--thronged with numbers of Kankas, and
vultures; and swarming with flocks of jackals. And striking affright to
the timid, on the earth started up (spectral) headless trunks,--with
their arms and heads torn, and their bodies torn all over. And monkeys
and Rakshasas began to drop down to the earth. And the army of
night-rangers, being brutally handled by the monkey-hosts, broke up at
every point at the very sight of Vajradanshtra. And seeing the
Rakshasas, distressed with fright and harassed by the monkeys, the
powerful Vajradanshtra, with his eyes crimson-hued with choler, entered
the arena, bow in hand,--frightening the monkey-forces. And he began to
pierce the monkeys with straight-speeding shafts winged with Kanka
feathers; And he pierced simultaneously seven, eight, nine, five,
monkeys (in the field). And the exceedingly powerful Vajradanshtra,
sported into a towering passion, began to cleave the docile ranks. And
thereat terrified, the monkeys, with their bodies cut with arrows,
rushed towards Angada, like vultures resorting to the Creator. And
finding the monkey-ranks disordered, Vali's son in a rage cast his eyes
on Vajradanshtra, who also was eying him. And Vajradanshtra and Angada
fought fiercely with each other over and over again; ranging the field
like a tiger and a mad elephant[167]. Then (Vajradanshtra) with hundreds
and thousands (of shafts) resembling tongues of flames, pierced the
powerful son of the monkey in the vitals. Thereupon Vali's son of mighty
strength and tremendous prowess, with his body covered all over with
blood, hurled a tree at Vajradanshtra. And seeing the tree in full
career, the Rakshasa without betraying any agitation, severed it in
pieces; and the tree, thus assailed, fell to the earth. And seeing that
feat of Vajradanshtra, that foremost of monkeys, taking up a huge crag,
hurled it (at his foe) and sent up shouts. And seeing this descend upon
him, that powerful one, calmly leaping down from his vehicle, stood on
his feet on the ground. And the crag discharged by Angada, coursing on
in the field, dashed to pieces the car along with the wheels and the
_Kuvara_ as well as the horses. And then the monkey, taking up another
prodigious peak crowned with trees, let it alight on Vajradanshtra's
head. Thereat vomitting blood, Vajradanshtra, deprived of his senses,
for a moment overcome with stupor, stood embracing his mace, sighing.
And then the night-ranger, recovering his senses, with his mace, in high
rage hit at the breast Vali's son staying in the field. And thereupon,
giving up his mace, he entered into a boxing encounter (with Angada).
And hitting each other there, they both--the monkey and the
Rakshasa,--began to vomit blood, and were overcome with fatigue
consequent on the thrashing each sustained; and they endowed richly with
prowess, appeared like Angaraka and Budha.[168] Then the exceedingly
energetic Angada--best of monkeys--uprooting a tree, stood there,
covered with flowers and leaves. And (Vajradanshtra) took a shield
composed of ass's hide,[169] and a sword broad and sightly, covered with
bells, and graced with a leathern sheath. And the monkey and the
Rakshasa displayed curious and graceful movements. And attacking each
other, they gave shouts, eager for victory. And with blood flowing from
their wounds, they looked beautiful like blossoming Kincukas. And
warring, both, overcome with fatigue, went to the ground on their knees.
Anon in the twinkling of an eye, that powerful monkey--Angada--started
up, with his eyes glowing,--like unto a serpent that hath been smitten
with a rod. And (at length) with his stainless and sharpened sword,
Vali's son, endeued with exceeding strength severed Vajradanshtra's huge
head. And the graceful head of that one having his body covered with
blood, cut off by the sword, falling to the ground with its eyes
rolling, was severed in twain. Seeing Vajradanshtra slain, the
Rakshasas, overwhelmed with fear and exceedingly agitated, in pitiful
plight, with woe-begone faces and heads hung in shame,--fled towards
Lanka, attacked (all the while) by the monkeys. Having compassed
Vajradanshtra's destruction, the powerful son of Vali, endowed with
exceeding strength, in the midst of the monkey-army experienced great
joy on being honored by the monkeys, like the wielder of the
thunder-bolt--the thousand-eyed (Deity)--surrounded by the celestials.

Hearing Vajradanshtra slain by the son of Vali, Ravana said unto the
general of his forces, standing before him with joined hands,--"Let
invincible Rakshasas of dreadful prowess, march forth, placing before
them Akampana, skilled in all weapons and arms. He is capable of
chastising foes as well as of protecting his own and leading them; and
he is excellent in warfare. And he is always desirous of my prosperity,
and always loveth warfare. He will conquer the Kakutsthas, as well as
Sugriva endowed with exceeding strength, and, without doubt, slay all
the other dreadful monkeys". Taking Ravana's command, that highly
powerful one endowed with fleet vigor, marshalled those forces. Then
equipped with various arms, the foremost of Rakshasas, having dreadful
eyes (in their heads), and of dreadful forms, marched forth, urged on by
their general. And, ascending a large car, adorned with burnished gold,
Akampana, possessed of the splendour of clouds,[170] and cloud-hued, and
furnished with a voice resembling the roar of clouds, went out,
environed by Rakshasas of terrific forms. And Akampana, resembling the
sun in power, was incapable[171] of being shaken in fight by the very
gods, and of being beheld by them.[172] And as, burning for battle, he
rushed out in wrath, the steeds drawing his car suddenly lost their
energy. And the left eye of that one delighting in encounter, began to
throb. And his countenance grew pale, and his voice faltered. And in a
fair day, it looked foul with the wind breathing roughly. And fierce and
frightful beasts and birds began to emit cries. And that lion-shouldered
one like a tiger in prowess, without heeding these ominous occurences,
marched forth into the field. And as that Rakshasa was setting out along
with the Rakshasas, he set up mighty roars as if agitating the deep. And
the mighty army of monkeys was seized with trepidation at that sound.
And then there took place a mighty encounter of the Rakshasas and the
monkeys equipped staying in fight with trees and rocks; who had given up
all concern for their selves in behalf of Rama and Ravana. And each side
desirous of slaying the other, the monkeys and the Rakshasas were
exceedingly strong and heroic and like unto mountains. And each party
storming at the other, in that conflict were heard loud cries emitted by
those swift-speeding ones in anger. And fearful was the dust red-hued
that was raised incessantly by the monkeys and the Rakshas; and it
enveloped the ten cardinal points. And in the field of battle, each
enveloped with that dust raised, pale as silk, could not be discovered
by the other. And in consequence of that dust arising, neither standard,
nor ensign, nor shield, nor steed, nor weapon, nor car could be seen.
And the fierce cries alone of those roaring and rushing were heard in
that dreadful battle; but their forms were not visible to the sight. And
in that conflict in the dark then monkeys enraged slew monkeys, and
Rakshasas Rakshsasas. And monkeys and Rakshasas slaying
(indiscriminately) friends and foes, made the earth wet with blood, and
miry. And then with showers of blood the dust was layed; and the earth
was covered with corpses. And Rakshasas and monkeys fast slew each other
vigorously with trees and darts, maces and _pracas_, rocks, bludgeons
and _tomaras_, and by means of their arms resembling bludgeons, coped
with their adversaries appearing like hills. And in the encounter
monkeys slew Rakshasas of dreadful deeds. And in their turn Rakshasas,
wrought up with passion, bearing in their hands _pracas_ and _tomaras_
destroyed monkeys wielding dire arms. And that leader of the
force--Akampana--growing wroth, inspired with cheerfulness all the
Rakshasas endowed with dreadful vigor. And the monkeys forcibly
snatching away the weapons (of the Rakshasas), began to rive the
Rakshasas with mighty trees and giant crags. In the meanwhile those
heroes among the monkeys--Kumuda, Nila and the exceedingly exasperated
Mainda, summoned the utmost impetuosity they were masters of. And those
foremost of monkeys and redoubtable able warriors without much ado began
to spread quite a carnage in the van of the Rakshasa army, and by means
of various arms terribly beat the Rakshasas.

SECTION LVI.


And witnessing that mighty exploit of the foremost of the monkeys,
Akampana waxed furious with wrath. And transported with passion, he,
twanging his mighty bow, seeing that feat of his foe, addressed his
charioteer saying,--"O charioteer, swiftly conduct thou the car to that
same place. These powerful ones are slaying innumerable Rakshasas in
fight. And all those vigorous monkeys of dreadful deeds stay before me,
armed with trees and rocks. Those, pluming themselves overmuch on their
martial worth, I intended to slay in battle. And all this Rakshasa force
appeared to be harassed by these". Then on a car drawn by moving steeds,
Akampana from a distance attacked the monkeys with showers of arrows.
And thereat the monkeys could not so much as maintain their ground in
the field,--and how could they fight? And broken by the arrows of
Akampana, they began to fly. And the exceedingly strong Hanuman, seeing
his kindred come under the masterdom of Death and follow the course
pursued by the shafts of Akampana, advanced (to the conflict). And
seeing that mighty monkey, all those heroic prime monkeys together
surrounded (Hanuman) in the field. And those best of monkeys, seeing
Hanuman stay, grew strong by relying on that strong one. And even as the
great Indra showereth down rain, Akampana showered shafts on Hanuman
resembling a mountain-summit in grandeur. And without casting a thought
on the showers of arrows poured on his person, that monkey gifted with
exceeding strength, set his heart on compassing the death of Akampana.
And laughing, that exceedingly energetic offspring of the Wind-god
rushed after that Raksha, as if making the Earth herself tremble. And
the form of that one roaring and flaming up in energy, was irresistible,
like unto the appearance of a flaming fire. And thinking that he was
unfurnished with any arms, that foremost of monkeys, waxing wroth,
vehemently rooted up a hill. And taking that huge hill, the Wind-god's
son endowed with prowess, sending up a tremendous roar, began to whirl
it with a single arm. And as of yore Purandara had in encounter pursued
Namuchi with the thunder-bolt, (Hanuman) pursued that best of
Rakshasas--Akampana. And Akampana, seeing that uplifted crag, from a
distance cut it off with mighty crescent-shaped shafts. And finding that
mountain-top severed by the shafts of the Raksha and scattered in
pieces, Hanuman was seized with a mighty wrath. And that monkey, wrought
up with rage and pride, grasping an Acwakarna elevated like unto a hill,
at once uprooted it. And taking that broad-shouldered Acwakarna, that
one furnished with high splendour, with great glee whirled it above the
ground. And thereat rushing amain vehemently, (Akampana) speedily broke
the trees.[173] And (seeing this), Hanuman, transported with passion,
rived the earth with his kicks. And Hanuman slaughtered elephants, and
the riders thereof, and cars with their riders, and dreadful Rakshasas,
and footmen. And seeing the enraged Hanuman resembling the Finisher
armed with trees and destructive, the Rakshasas began to fly fast. And
seeing that one enraged, terrific unto the Rakshasas, the heroic
Akampana was agitated greatly and sent up shouts. And Akampana pierced
Hanuman endowed with exceeding prowess with four and ten shafts,
sharpened and capable of cleaving the bodies of people. And thus covered
with iron arrows and whetted darts, that hero--Hanuman--looked like a
hill covered with trees. And that huge-bodied one endowed with wondrous
prowess and great strength, appeared like a flowering Acoka or a fire
without smoke. And then uprooting another tree, (Hanuman) summoning up
his best impetuosity, swiftly hit Akampana--foremost of Rakshasas--on
the head. And slain with that tree by that high-souled monkey-chief
wrought up with passion, that Rakshasa fell down and died.[174] And
seeing that foremost of Rakshasas--Akampana--slain (and lying) on the
ground,--the Rakshasas were extremely aggrieved, and (appeared) like
trees in an earthquake. And those Rakshasas defeated, leaving their arms
behind, made for Lanka in fear, pursued by the monkeys. And with their
hair flowing loosely, (the Rakshasas), afflicted with affright, and
despirited and beaten, fled fast, with the water of fatigue running down
their persons. And crushing down each other, they entered the city in a
panic, momentarily casting their looks behind them. When the Rakshasas
had entered Lanka, the exceedingly mighty monkeys, assembled together,
paid homage unto Hanuman. And Hanuman, gifted with strength, honored the
seniors each as he deserved in consideration of his lineage. And the
monkeys eager for victory shouted with might and main, and began to drag
the Rakshasas with the view of taking their lives. And that mighty
monkey--son unto the Wind god--having destroyed the Rakshasas and
arrived (in the midst of the host), attained heroic glory,--even as did
Vishnu, having slain that destroyer of enemies--the mighty and dreadful
Asura possessed of exceeding strength,--stationed in the van of the
forces. And then the deities and Rama himself and the highly powerful
Lakshmana, and also the monkeys headed by Sugriva, and Bibhishana
endowed with great strength, honored that monkey.

[173] Why plural? So it is, however, in the text.--T.

[174] This sentence, "And slain......and died" reads foolish. But the
      original is answerable for--in logical parlance--this identical
      proposition.--T.



SECTION LVII.


Hearing that Akampana had been killed, the lord of Rakshasas,
overwhelmed with anger, with his face somewhat fallen, cast his eyes on
his counsellors. And then pondering and reflecting for a while, in the
forenoon he went round the city of Lanka for inspecting the barracks.
And the king surveyed the city guarded by the Rakshasas, covered with
innumerable barracks, and crowned with ensigns and standards. And seeing
the city beseiged, Ravana--lord of the Rakshasas--seasonably spoke words
of welfare unto Prahasta skilled in fight,--"Save battle, deliverance
find I none for the city suddenly beleaguered and put to straits. And
this strain must be borne by these versed in warfare--me or Kumbhakarna
or thee--my general--or Indrajit or Nikumbha.[175] And therefore do thou
from this place, speedily taking this force, march to where the monkeys
are, for securing victory (in the encounter). And as soon as thou
settest out, the monkey-forces, hearing the roars of the foremost
Rakshasas--speedily setting themselves in motion,--shall flee away. And
volatile and haughty and of fickle minds, the monkeys will not be able
to bear thy shouts; even as elephants are incapable of bearing the
roaring of a lion. And on that monkey-army running away, Rama in company
with Sumitra's son, deprived of his power and shorn of support, shall, O
Prahasta, come under thy subjection. In this matter, thy being slain is
uncertain, but victory is certain. Now do thou, as thou weighest our
welfare, declare thyself for or against this course". Thus addressed by
Ravana, Prahasta--general of the forces--said unto the Rakshasa-chief;
like _Ucanas_ addressing the lord of Asuras,--"O, king, before this we
had deliberated together with wise counsellors, and then we disputed
with each other in our respective views. And I had declared myself for
giving up Sita as fraught with our welfare; and we saw war involved in
witholding her. I have ever been honored by thee variously with gifts
and regard and soft speech. And what is thy good for which I shall not
be at the pains? My life I do not care to keep,--nor yet my sons or my
wife. Behold! for thee will I offer up my life into the sacrificial fire
of conflict". Having said this unto his master--Ravana--the general,
Prahasta, addressed his generals staying before him, saying,--"At once
bring up the mighty host of Rakshasas. To-day in the field of fight will
I entertain the flesh-feeding fowls of the forest with the bodies of the
foes slain with my resistless shafts". Hearing his speech, the highly
powerful leaders arrayed the army in that abode of the Rakshasa. And in
a moment Lanka swarmed with heroic and terrific Rakshasas equipped with
various arms,--as if with elephants,--as well as with people worshipping
Fire and bowing down unto Brahmanas. And the perfumed breeze blew, laden
with the incense of sacrificial offerings. And the Rakshasas, inspired
with martial ardour, put on diverse garlands, consecrated with
scriptural formulae; and donned on their armour. And furnished with
their bows and wearing their armour, the Rakshasas, on seeing king
Ravana, leaving (their vehicles), stood, surrounding Prahasta. Then
greeting the monarch, Prahasta, furnished (with all appliances of
battle),--winding his dreadful trumpet, ascended his car; having all
sorts of weapons; yoked with wondrous fleet steeds; driven by a
competent charioteer,--excellently furnished; sending up sounds
resembling the rumbling of mighty masses of cloud,--appearing like the
very Sun or Moon; invincible with a serpent-standard; having a defence
as well as a portion exceedingly handsome; netted with gold all round;
and seeming to be laughing in grace. And then, ascending this car,
Prahasta, whom Ravana had entrusted with authority, surrounded by a vast
host, swiftly went out of Lanka. And then there were heard the sounds of
kettle-drums, resembling the roars of Parjanya,--and the sounds of
musical instruments, as if filling the Earth. And on that general of the
forces marching, sounds of conchs were heard (all around); and the
Rakshasas of dreadful forms and huge bodies, going before Prahasta,
advanced, emitting tremendous roars. And Narantaka,[176] Kambhahanu,
Mahanada,[177] and Samunnata,[178]--Prahasta's counsellors all of
them--went on, surrounding him. And he went out by the Eastern entrance,
environed by this exceedingly dreadful array, resembling troops of
elephants. And resembling the Destroyer--Yama himself--Prahasta in rage
went out surrounded by that mighty host resembling the sea. And at the
tumult raised by their exodus, as well as the roars of the Rakshasas,
all creatures in Lanka began to cry in preternatural tones. And swarming
under the cloudless welkin, birds feasting on flesh and gore began to
gyrate at the right hand of the car. And dreadful jackals, emitting live
flames from their mouths, set up cries. And stars began to shoot from
the firmament; and the winds to ruffle. And enraged at each other, the
planetary bodies were shorn of their brightness. And clouds emitting
sharp sounds showered down blood upon the car, and those marching in
front were washed therewith. And alighting at the top of the standard, a
vulture set up cries, facing the south, and began to prick both its
sides,--thereby depriving (Prahasta) of his grace. And from the hands of
his charioteer and his driver conducting the steeds, never given to
turning away from the field, the goad began to drop again and again. And
the auspiciousness that was bright and rare when the army set out, was
clean gone in a moment,--and the steeds began to stumble on even ground.
And as Prahasta of renowned worth and valor marched, the monkey-army
equipped with various arms, presented themselves before him. And loud
was the tumult that was raised by the monkeys. And mighty was the din
that was heard of those, uprooting trees and taking up ponderous crags
of the Rakshasas roaring and the monkeys storming in both the
exhilarated armies of Rakshas and wood-rangers,--of vehement and able
(warriors) eager for slaying each other, and challenging each other to
fight. And like an insect falling into a flame, the wicked-minded
Prahasta, for obtaining victory, increasing his impetuosity entered into
that host of the monkey-king.

[175] Grammatically faulty such is the sentence in the original.--T.

[176] Lit. _destroyer of men_. Almost all the names of the Rakshasas are
      thus significant names. This assigning of names, embosoming some

      considered as betokening a high poetical faculty.

SECTION LVIII.


Seeing Prahasta sally, ready for encounter, that chastiser of
foes--Rama--with a smile said unto Bibhishana,--"Who is this huge-bodied
one that armed with impetuosity, advanceth to the encounter? And what is
his power and prowess like? O mighty-armed one, tell me this concerning
this powerful night-ranger". Hearing Raghava's words, Bibhishana
answered,--"In Lanka this is the general of the lord of Rakshasas--the
Rakshasa named Prahasta, surrounded by a third of the forces. He is
possessed of prowess and is of distinguished gallantry. And that mighty
army of strong monkeys, wrought up with wrath, and roaring at Prahasta,
saw him dreadful and of terrific prowess and huge-bodied,--surrounded on
all sides by the Rakshasas,--and setting up roars, marching. And the
Rakshasas, eagerly desirous of victory, pursued the monkeys, wielding
swords and darts and _rishtis_, and javelins and shafts and maces and
clubs and bludgeons and _pracas_ and various axes and curious bows. And
the monkeys on their part, eager for encounter, took up flowering trees
and hills and huge and broad crags. And each party approaching the
other, great was the encounter that took place. And innumerable (monkeys
and Rakshasas) kept showering rocks and arrows. And many Rakshasas in
conflict slew many a powerful monkey, and the monkeys on their part
slaughtered many a Rakshasa. And some were pierced with darts and with
(other) powerful weapons; and some were wounded with bludgeons; and some
were hewn with axes. And some rendered senseless, dropped down to the
earth; and some hit with weapons, had their breasts riven. And some,
severed in twain with swords, dropped to the earth lifeless. And monkeys
were hewn in their sides by heroic Rakshasas. And numbers of Rakshasas
all around were beaten to the ground by infuriated monkeys with trees
and mountain-peaks. And some smitten sore with slaps having the touch of
the thunder-bolt, began to vomit blood from their mouths, with faces and
eyes turned pale. And great was the uproar that arose in consequence of
Rakshasas and monkeys emitting distressful cries and sending forth
leonine roars. And monkeys and Rakshasas wrought up with wrath, engaged
in treading the path of heroes,--looking terrific with their faces
moving about,--performed deeds of intrepid courage. And Narantaka and
Kambhahanu and Mahanada and Samunnata--all counsellors of Prahasta--set
about slaughtering the rangers of the woods. Of these doing swift
execution among the monkeys, Dwivida, taking up a mountain-peak, slew
one--namely Narantaka. And then the monkey, Durmukha, rising up afresh,
armed with a mighty tree, killed the light-handed Rakshasa--Samunnata.
And Jambavan endowed with energy, waxing enraged, uplifting a giant crag
brought the same down on Mahanada's breast. And there speedily assailed
by Tara, with a mighty tree, the powerful Kumbhahanu gave up the ghost
in the conflict. And not brooking that feat, Prahasta, mounted on a car,
taking a bow in his hand, fell to spreading a dreadful havoc among the
rangers of the woods. And then there the two hosts mingled into almost a
vortex; and the sounds that arose from those infuriated ones of
immeasurable might, resembled the roar of the ocean. And in terrific
encounter the enraged Rakshasa irresistible in battle drove the monkeys
to sore straits with showers of arrows. And the earth was covered quite
with the terrible bodies of monkeys and Rakshasas; and it looked as if
covered with mountains. And the earth drenched with streams of gore
looked as if swarming with blossoming _palacas_ in the month of spring.
And as leaders of elephant-herds cross a lotus-tank covered with
lotus-dust, those Rakshasas and choice monkeys crossed that river
flowing in the field of conflict incapable of being crossed; having for
her banks hosts of heroic warriors slain; for her mighty trees broken
arms; for her volume of waters showers of blood; coursing to Yama
resembling the Ocean; with livers and spleens for her vast slime; with
scattered entrails for her moss; with riven bodies and heads for her
fish; limbs for her lawns; swarming with vultures for her swans; with
Kankas for her cranes; filled with fat representing her foam; with the
roars (of warriors) for her sounds,--incapable of being crossed by
cravens,--and resembling a real river swarming at the end of the rains
with cranes and swans. Then all of a sudden Nila saw Prahasta stationed
on his car, discharging vollies of shafts and harassing the monkeys
therewith. And mounted on a sun-bright vehicle, that leader of the
army--Prahasta--seeing Nila advance towards him amain in the encounter,
like the wind in the sky scattering a mighty mass of clouds,--rushed
towards Nila. And that leader of forces--Prahasta--foremost of bowmen,
stretching his bow, began to shower arrows on Nila. And having pierced
Nila sore and wounded him, those shafts sought the earth like enraged
serpents. And that mighty monkey--Nila--endowed with energy, struck with
those sharpened shafts resembling flames,--uprooting a tree, assailed
therewith the irrepressible Prahasta--who was rushing against him. And
thereat, that foremost of Rakshasas, on being attacked, flaming up into
fury and uttering roars,--poured showers of arrows on the monkey-leader.
And not being able to resist the arrowy vollies of that wicked-minded
Rakshasa, (Nila) bore them, even as a bull beareth with closed eyes a
fast-descending autumnal shower. And in the very same way did Nila with
his eyes closed suddenly stand the mighty arrowy buffet of Prahasta
incapable of being withstood. And wrought up with rage, the exceedingly
strong and mighty Nila with a giant _Sala_ slew the steeds of Prahasta.
And then his soul surcharged with wrath, Nila swiftly shattered the bow
of that wicked-minded one, and then shouted again and again. On being
bereft of his bow, Prahasta, general of forces, taking a terrible mace,
leapt down from his car. And the redoubtable leaders endowed with
activity, bearing hostility to each other, their persons bathed in
blood, stood (on the ground) like two elephants (with their temples)
riven. And they kept tearing each other with their teeth like a lion and
a tiger, and also striving like a lion and a tiger. And endowed with
victorious vigor, those heroes, never knowing to desist from fight, were
eager for fame, even like Vritra and Vasava (fighting). And then
Prahasta putting forth his dearest effort, hit Nila on the temples with
a mace; and the blood began to flow. And then the mighty monkey, with
his person drenched in blood,--wrought up with passion, discharged a
tall tree at Prahasta's breast. And without caring for that hit, he,
taking up a mighty mace, furiously rushed against the monkey--Nila. And
witnessing that enraged (hero) rushing against him with exceeding
impetuosity, that redoubted monkey endowed with vehemence, took up a
tremendous crag. And in the encounter Nila at once let that crag alight
right on the head of Prahasta, eager for encounter and fighting with the
mace. And hurled by that foremost of monkeys, that huge and terrific
crag then shattered Prahasta's head in pieces. And then bereft of life
and shorn of nerve and devoid of sense, he suddenly dropped down to the
earth like a tree whose roots have been severed. And even as fountains
flow from the sides of a hill, blood flowed profusely from the person of
that one, whose head had been riven. On Prahasta being slain by Nila,
that mighty army of Rakshasas, never trembling (from fear),--retreated
towards Lanka. And like waters rushing (through a breach in) a dyke, the
Rakshasas could not stand their ground, on their leader being slain. And
on that head of the hosts being killed, the Rakshasas, growing
dispirited, repairing to the residence of the lord of Rakshas, remained
plunged in thought, without speaking anything. And plunged in that sea
of sorrow, they seemed as if they had been bereft of their senses. And
then the highly powerful and victorious Nila, leader of forces, on being
extolled with gracious offices, and on being joined by Rama and
Lakshmana, looked exceedingly exhilarated.



SECTION LIX.


And on the leader of the Rakshasa host being slain in battle by the
foremost of monkeys, that army of the Rakshasa monarch, resembling the
ocean in violence,--furnished with dreadful weapons, began to scamper
away. And going to the lord of the Rakshasas, they apprised him of the
death of his general at the hands of the Fire-god's offspring. And
hearing those words of theirs, the Rakshasa lord was overcome with rage.
And hearing that Prahasta had been killed in battle, (he), exercised
with passion, with his heart influenced with grief, addressed those
foremost of the Rakshasa hosts, even as Indra addresses the chiefs among
the celestials, saying,--"That foe should no longer be disregarded that
hath slain along with his followers and elephants that leader of my
hosts that had destroyed the forces of Indra himself. Therefore, without
taking thought, will I, for compassing the destruction of the foe,
myself march to that marvellous field of fight. And to-day, even as a
flaming fire burneth down a forest, will I with showers of shafts burn
up that monkey-army, and Rama and Lakshmana". Saying this, that enemy of
the sovereign of the immortals ascended a flaming vehicle of dazzling
sheen yoked to rows of excellent steeds,--displaying itself gloriously
and having a glowing body. And eulogized with sacred hymns, the
sovereign of the Rakshasa rulers then set out to the sounds of conchs
and trumpets and _panavas_; and in the midst of those produced by
persons striking at their arms, with their hands, and of the sounds
defiance, and leonine roars. And like that lord of the
immortals--Rudra--surrounded by ghosts, the foremost of the Rakshsa
monarchs was surrounded by bands of flesh-feeding (Rakshas) resembling
cliffs and clouds,--with eyes glowing like fire. And at once issuing
from the city, that one endowed with high energy saw that fierce array
of monkeys, extended as the ocean or a mighty mass of clouds,--with arms
upraised with rocks and stones. And seeing that terrific host of
Rakshasas, that eminently auspicious one, followed by the forces, having
arms resembling the lord of serpents--Rama--spoke unto Bibhishana,
foremost of those bearing arms,--"Whose is this force furnished with
various ensigns and standards--and equipped with _pracas_ and swords and
darts and other arms,--consisting of intrepid (Rakshasas), and having
elephants resembling Mahendra[179] itself". Then hearing Rama's speech,
Bibhishana, possessed of the prowess of Sakra himself, informed Rama
anent that foremost of hosts consisting of that flower of high-souled
Rakshasas, saying,--"O king, him do thou know to be Akampana, who,
possessed of a high soul, is on the back of that elephant,--whose face
looks like the sun new risen, and who approacheth making the head of his
elephant tremble (with the splendour of his person).[180] And that one
is named Indrajit--foremost by virtue of the boon (that he hath
obtained), who ascending a car and having a lion for his
ensign,--twangeth his bow like the very bow of Sakra displayed,--and who
with his terrific round teeth appeareth like an elephant. And that one
of a gigantic person is named Atikaya, that, like unto the Setting-hill
of Vindhya, furnished with the bow and stationed on a car,--highly
heroic, stretcheth his bow of unparalleled proportions. And that
high-souled hero is named Mahodara that, furnished with right coppery
eyes resembling the sun new risen, and ascending a car resonant with the
sound of bells, shouteth shrill. And that one having the vehemence of
the thunder-bolt is Picacha, that, mounted on a steed in variegated
golden trappings, and having the aspect of a mass of evening clouds, or
a mountain,--(appeareth) with a _praca_ furnished with effulgence. And
that one is the famed Triciras,[181] that, grasping a whetted dart
endowed with the splendour of lightning and having the speed of the
thunder for its minister, approacheth, riding a bull--the best of his
species--and having the appearance of the Moon himself. And that one
looking like a mass of clouds, that, having a broad and beautiful breast
and a banner surmounted with the king of serpents, goeth in collected
carriage, stretching his bow is Kumbha. And that one is Nikumbha of
wondrous valorous deeds (in battle) that, grasping a flaming and
smoky[182] bludgeon embellished with gold and diamonds, cometh--a very
banner of the entire Raksha host. And that one is Narantaka, fighting
with mountain-peaks,--that appeareth before us, mounted on a car flaming
like fire, furnished with pennons and equipped with bows and swords and
shafts. And that crusher of the hauteur of even the celestials,--that
surrounded by various spectres of dreadful forms having faces of tigers,
or camels, or powerful elephants, or deer, or horses,--and with their
eyes rolling,--where the white umbrella resembling the Moon,--shineth,
graced with slender ribs--the high-souled sovereign of Rakshas appeareth
like Rudra himself environed by spectres,--the sovereign of the Rakshas
decked with a diadem, with his countenance graced with pendulous
ear-rings,--with a person resembling that monarch of mountains--even
Vindhya himself,--that humbler of the pride of Indra the Great and
Yama,--shineth like the Sun". Then Rama--repressor of foes--answered
Bibhishana, saying,--"Alas! Ravana--lord of the Rakshasas--is of
exceeding glowing splendour; and Ravana shineth in glory, and is
incapable of being gazed at like the Sun himself. And his grace, being
enshrouded in his own splendour, I cannot view plainly. And the persons
of celestials appear splendid as doth the person of the Rakshasa-chief.
And all the warriors of that high-souled one are like mountains and
fight with crags; and all are equipped with flaming weapons. And
environed by glowing ghosts of dreadful forms and fierce-looking and
furnished with material tenements,[183]--the king of Rakshasas appeareth
imposing like the Destroyer himself. And by luck it is that to-day the
wicked-minded one hath come within the range of my vision; and to-day
will I vent my wrath incident to the ravishment of Sita". Having said
this, Rama endowed with prowess, ever followed by Lakshmana, stood,
taking up his bow and pulling out a powerful shaft. And then that
high-souled lord of Rakshasas addressed that mighty host, saying,--"Do
ye casting off fear stay at ease, at the gateways, high ways, and the
edifices (in Lanka). Taking note of this lapse,--_viz_., that ye have
all come hither with me, the wood-rangers in a body, subduing the empty
city incapable of being withstood,--shall suddenly put (all) to
straits". Then leaving those counsellors, (Ravana) on the Rakshas having
departed agreeably to his injunction, dived into that ocean of monkeys,
like a mighty fish diving into the waves of over brimming deep. And
seeing the lord of Rakshasas, furnished with flaming a bow and
arrows,--suddenly rushing,--the king of monkeys, uprooting a mighty
mountain-top, darted against the sovereign of the Rakshas. And taking up
that mountain-peak having its sides covered with innumerable trees, he
hurled it at the night ranger. And seeing it descend swiftly, (Ravana)
in battle severed the same by means of gold-knobbed shafts. And on that
gigantic peak furnished with fair sides filled with trees, falling to
the earth, severed in pieces,--the lord of Rakshasas took up an arrow,
resembling a mighty serpent and having the splendour of the Destroyer
himself. And taking that shaft endowed with the vehemence of the wind,
flaming like a fire aglow, and having the impetuosity of the great
Indra's thunder-bolt, (Ravana) hurled it in rage to compass the
destruction of Sugriva. And even as the fierce dart discharged by
Guha[184] had pierced Krauncha,[185] that shaft shot by Ravana, rushing
in violence at Sugriva possessed of a person having the touch of Sakra's
thunder-bolt, pierced it. Thereat, agonised by the shaft, that hero,
with his senses bewildered, dropped down to the ground with shrieks. And
seeing him down on the earth bereft of his senses, the Yatudhanas were
filled with rejoicing. And then Gavaksha and Gavaya, Sushena, Rishabha,
Jyotimukha and Nala, uprooting crags and magnifying their bodies, rushed
against the lord of Rakshasas. And the lord of Rakshasas with hundreds
of shafts having sharpened heads, rendered their strokes fruitless. And
then he rived those foremost of monkeys with showers of arrows having
variegated golden knobs, and covered those fierce monkey-ranks with
networks of arrows. And on being sore assailed and falling in
consequence, those heroes, the monkeys, pierced with terrific arrows,
and distressed with the shafts of Ravana, emitting cries, sought the
shelter of Rama worthy of being sought. Then the high-souled and
excellent bowman--Rama,--taking his bow, at once sallied forth. And
thereat, Lakshmana, approaching Rama, with joined hands addressed him
words couching prime import. "O noble one, I alone am fit to compass the
destruction of this wicked-minded one. I will slay him. Do thou, O
master, permit me". To him replied Rama of exceeding energy, having
truth for his prowess,--"Go then, O Lakshmana, and put forth thy utmost
exertions in the encounter. Ravana is forsooth endowed with mighty
energy, and his prowess in battle is wonderful. Without doubt, when
enraged, he is incapable of being borne by this triple world. Do thou
keep an eye on his shortcomings as thou shouldst watch thine own
failings. Being always on the alert, thou must with thy eyes as much as
thy bow protect thyself". Hearing Raghava's speech, Sumitra's son,
embracing Rama, and saluting him and paying him his respects, went forth
to battle. And (going unto the field), he found Ravana, endowed with
arms resembling the trunks of elephants,--wielding his dreadful and
flaming bow, and covering with showers of arrows those monkeys, whose
bodies had been swarming with shafts. And seeing Ravana, the exceedingly
powerful Hanuman--son unto the Wind-god--resisting that downpour of
arrows, charged him vehemently. And coming at his car, the intelligent
Hanuman, uplifting his right arm and terrifying Ravana,
said,--"Incapable of being slain by gods, Danavas or Gandharvas, Yakshas
or Rakshasas,--Fear hath (at last) found thee, coming even from monkeys.
This my upraised right arm furnished with five fingers, shall rob thee
of thy soul long resident (in thy body)". Hearing Hanuman's speech,
Ravana possessed of dreadful prowess, with his eyes reddened in wrath,
said these words,--"Strike thou swift maugre fear; and acquire lasting
renown. And, O monkey, having (at first) taken the measure of thy might,
will I finish thee". Hearing Ravana's words, the offspring of the
Wind-god said,--"(First) remember thou thy son--Aksha--slaughtered by
me!" Thus addressed, the exceedingly energetic lord of the Rakshasas
possessed of prowess dealt a slap unto the offspring of the Wind-god.
And struck with his slap, he shook momentarily. And staying for a moment
and calling up fortitude, that magnanimous one administered a slap unto
the foe of the immortals. And hit by the highsouled monkey, the
Ten-necked one trembled, as trembleth a mountain during an earthquake.
And witnessing Ravana struck with a slap (by Hanuman) saints and Siddhas
and celestials and the Asuras shouted in glee. Then attaining a little
respite, Ravana said,--"Well done, O monkey. In prowess thou art a foe I
pride in". Thus addressed by Ravana, the Wind-god's son said,--"Fie on
my prowess, seeing that thou breathest yet, O Ravana. Strike at the same
time, O perverse one. Why dost thou bluster? And then my blow shall
despatch thee to the mansions of Yama". And at the speech of the
Wind-god's son, his ire flamed up. And then that one endowed with
prowess, clenching his right fist carefully, let it alight amain on the
monkey's chest. And hit at his spacious chest, Hanuman shook over and
over again. And seeing the mighty Hanuman overwhelmed, that powerful
car-warrior ascended on his car, approached Nila. And the powerful lord
of Rakshasas--the Ten-necked one--made that general of
forces--Nila--aflame with dreadful shafts entering into the vitals,
resembling snakes. And assailed with shafts, Nila--leader of
monkeys--with one arm took up a mountain-top and hurled it at the lord
of Rakshas. And the energetic and high-minded Hanuman, attaining
respite, eager for encounter, seeing (the fight between the Rakshasa and
the monkey), wrought up with rage, said,--"It is not meet for me to
attack Ravana--lord of Rakshasas--engaged with Nila". And the highly
powerful Ravana, by means of seven shafts with sharpened points, hit at
the mountain-top; and shivered in pieces, it fell (to the earth). And
seeing that mountain peak shattered, that general of the
monkey-forces--slayer of hostile heroes--flamed up in wrath like the
fire at the universal wreck. And in that encounter Nila discharged
Acwakarna trees, and _Salas_, and mangoes in full flower, and various
other trees. And Ravana, getting at the trees, severed them (by means of
his arrows), and poured on the Fire-god's son terrific showers of
shafts. And assailed with fearful showers of arrows as with a mass of
clouds, that one endowed with eminent strength, decreasing his
dimensions, dropped on the top of Ravana's banner. And seeing the son of
the Fire-god descend on the top of his banner. Ravana was fired with
ire, and Nila shouted (thereat). And seeing the monkey (now) at the top
of the banner, and (now) at the end of his bow, and (now) at the crest
of his tiara, Lakshmana and Hanuman and Rama were struck with
astonishment. And also Ravana endowed with exceeding energy, astonished
at the lightness of the monkey, took up a wonderful flaming fiery
weapon. And the monkeys seeing Ravana bewildered, and delighted thereat,
set up shouts. And Ravana encaged at the shouts of the monkeys, with his
heart overwhelmed with agitation, could not address himself to any
effort. And then taking a fiery shaft and setting the same on his bow,
the night-ranger gazed at Nila. And the exceedingly energetic lord of
the Rakshasas said,--"O monkey, by virtue of thy skill in illusion, thou
art furnished with lightness. But, O monkey, if thou canst, preserve thy
life. Thou transformest thyself into many shapes. Yet this shaft of mine
discharged from my weapon, shall deprive of thy life thee that art
preserving it". Having said this, the mighty-armed Ravana--lord of the
Rakshasas--fixing his shaft on his bow, shot it at the general. And
Nila, struck at the chest with that arrow, which had been shot (by
Ravana), burning, suddenly fell down to the earth. And by virtue of the
greatness of his sire and also of his own energy, he went to the earth
on his knees, but was not utterly deprived of life. And seeing the
monkey deprived of his senses, the Ten-necked one, eager for encounter,
riding a car emitting a rattle resembling the rumbling of clouds, darted
against Sumitra's son. And entering into the arena of fight and posted
there flaming, the powerful lord of the Rakshasas, baffling (the foe),
kept stretching his bow. And as that one of immeasurable prowess kept
stretching his bow, Sumitra's son of unflagging mettle, addressed him,
saying,--"O lord of night-rangers, do thou to-day try me in encounter.
Thou ought not to strive with the monkeys". And hearing Saumitri's
speech uttered in a full voice, as well as the terrific twangs of his.
bow-string, that Raksha--the king--approaching Sumitra's son staying in
the field, spoke unto him wrathfully,--"O Raghu's son, by my luck hast
thou of perverse sense, finding thy fate come within the range of my
ken. This very instant, tormented with the springes of my shafts, thou
wilt repair to the regions of Death". Thereat, Sumitra's son, without
being overwhelmed with wonder (on witnessing Ravana's prowess),
addressed that one furnished with large and sharp teeth,--setting up
roars,--"O king, those who are (really) endowed with prowess, do not
storm. O prince of sinners, in vain thou vauntest. O lord of Rakshasas,
I know thy prowess and strength and energy and vigor. Here am I
stationed, bow and shafts in hand. Come thou. What is the use of
vain-glorious self-laudation?" Thus accosted, the Raksha monarch,
growing wroth, discharged seven shafts furnished with knobs. Thereupon
Lakshmana split them up with sharp-pointed arrows having variegated
golden knobs. And they suddenly severed like powerful serpents cut off,
Lanka's lord came under the sway of passion, and discharged other
whetted arrows. And Rama's younger brother poured showers of arrows from
his bow; and, planting himself at his post, cut off those arrows (of his
adversary) by means of razors, and crescents, and excellent _karnas_ and
darts. And seeing his arrowy net-works rendered ineffectual, that enemy
of the celestials--the king--was seized with wonderment, and again shot
sharpened arrows. And Lakshmana also, resembling Indra the Great,
setting on his bow sharpened, sharp-pointed, flaming, and luminous
shafts, endowed with the dreadful vehement impetus of the thunder-bolt,
discharged (them), to compass the destruction of the lord of Rakshas.
And thereat the Rakshasa sovereign cut off those whetted arrows; and
smote Lakshmana in the forehead with an arrow resembling the Fire of
Dooms-day in energy,--which had been conferred on him by the
Self-create. And Lakshmana, tortured with Ravana's arrow, shook, loosely
holding his bow; and then recovering his consciousness after undergoing
extreme agony, he severed the bow of the foe of the foremost of
celestials. And having cut off Ravana's bow, Dacarathas son hit (him)
with three sharp-pointed arrows. And the king smarting under the shafts,
with much ado regained his consciousness. And the enemy of the immortals
of terrific power with his bow severed, and himself hit with shafts, and
his body covered with fat, and himself washed in blood, took up a dart
conferred on him by the Self-create. And the sovereign of the Rakshasas
and their lord in that encounter hurled at Sumitra's son the dart
resembling smoking fire, sending up living flames, and striking terror
into the monkeys. And as it coursed on, Bharata's younger brother
resisted it with arrows resembling a sacrificial flame. Yet the dart
pierced into the broad arm[186] of Dacaratha's son. And smit with the
dart, that hero of the Raghu race, although possessed of strength, was
aglow. And the king at once with his arms seized that one, who had been
deprived of his senses. But he that could with his arms wield Himavan or
Mandara or Meru or the triple world itself along with the immortals,
could not (for all his strength) lift up Bharata's younger brother. And
hit at his chest by the dart of Brahma, Sumitra's son remembered that he
was verily a portion of Vishnu himself. And pressing hard Sumitra's
son--that humbler of the hauteur of the Daityas, that thorn in the sides
of the celestials--could not move him (from his place). And then the
Wind-god's offspring waxing wroth rushed at Ravana, and overwhelmed with
rage smote at his chest with his clenched fist resembling the
thunder-bolt. And boxed (by Hanumana), Ravana--lord of the
Rakshasas--went down to the ground on his knees, and shook and dropped
to the earth. And blood gushed out in streams from his mouths and eyes
and arms; and staggered and senseless, he sat down on the platform of
his car. And he was rendered insensible with his senses lost; and he
knew not where he was. And seeing Ravana endued with terrific prowess,
rendered insensible in the encounter, saints and monkeys and gods with
the Asuras set up shouts. And then the energetic Hanuman taking
Lakshmana racked by Ravana, with his arms brought him before Raghava.
And albeit incapable of being moved by the foes, (Lakshmana), on account
of the friendship of the Wind-god's offspring as well as the high
reverence in which he was held by Hanuman, became extremely light to the
monkey. And then that dart, renouncing Sumitra's son vanquished in
fight, again sought its place in Ravana's car. And the exceedingly
powerful Ravana, recovering his consciousness in that dread encounter,
took up whetted shafts and seized a mighty bow. And that finisher of
foes--Lakshmana--recovered the exercise of his senses, and had his
entire person perfectly healed,--on his recalling that he verily was a
part and parcel of Vishnu himself. And witnessing the mighty army of the
monkeys and the redoubted heroes brought down in the conflict, Raghava
rushed at Ravana. Thereat drawing near to him, Hanuman said unto
him,--"It behoveth thee to chastise the foe ascending my back, even as
Vishnu chastiseth the enemies of the immortals, riding Garutman".
Hearing the words spoken by Hanuman, Raghava at once got up on that
gigantic monkey; and that master of men beheld Ravana in battle. And
seeing him, that highly powerful one darted against Ravana, even as the
enraged Vishnu had rushed against Virochana's son,[187] upraising his
weapons. And he sharply twanged his bow-string sounding like the
terrific crash of thunder; and then in solemn tones, Rama addressed the
lord of Rakshasas, saying,--"Stay, stay, having done me such wrong.
Repairing whither, shalt thou, O powerful Rakshasa, attain respite? Even
if thou shouldst seek Yama or Indra or the Sun--son unto Vivacwan--or
the Self-sprung or the Fire-god or Sankara himself,--or go to the ten
cardinal points in ten portions,--yet shalt thou not, so resorting,
attain deliverance. And (Lakshmana), going forth to the fight, hath been
wounded with the dart and hath suddenly been stupified. But, O king of
the Rakshas, to-day in conflict Death shall claim for his own thee and
thy sons and grandsons. By me with my shafts have been slaughtered four
and ten thousand Rakshas residing in Janasthana, wielding excellent
weapons". Hearing Raghava's words, the exceedingly strong lord of the
Rakshasas, overwhelmed with a mighty wrath, recalling enmity agone, with
burning shafts resembling the fire of Doom hit in encounter the
exceedingly impetuous offspring of the Wind-god, who was bearing
Raghava. And although struck and resisted by the Rakshasa with arrows,
the energy of that one, endowed by nature with prowess--increased
greatly. And the exceedingly energetic Rama, on seeing that foremost of
the monkeys wounded by Ravana, was mastered by wrath. And Rama, closing
with his enemy, by means of whetted arrow-points severed in pieces his
car together with the wheels and the steeds, the banner, the umbrella,
and the majestic streamer, as well as with the charioteer and the
thunder-bolts and darts and swords. And then as the reverend Indra
cleaveth Meru with his thunder-bolt, (Raghava) swiftly smote on Ravana's
spacious and shapely chest with a shaft resembling Vajra and the thunder
holt. And--that the king hero--who had not smarted nor shaken under the
impetus of Vajra and the thunder-bolt,--assailed with the arrow of Rama
and agonised in consequence, shook and lost hold of his bow. And seeing
him overwhelmed, Rama took up a flaming half-moon, and with the same at
once severed the sun-bright tiara of the high-souled sovereign of the
Rakshasas. And Rama in the encounter addressed the lord of Rakshasas,
resembling a serpent bereft of venom, shorn of his splendour, like unto
the sun shrouded (in mist),--without his wonted grace, and having his
entire tiara riven--saying,--"Thou hast (in battle) performed high and
dreadful deeds,--and hast also (in the conflict) slain my foremost
heroes. And therefore I know thou art fatigued. And for this reason it
is that I will not with my shafts bring thee to the door of Death. Go
thou. I know[188] that thou art worn out with fight. Therefore, O king
of night-rangers, enter Lanka. Having a little respite, do thou depart
on thy car along with thy bowmen. Afterwards, mounted on thy car, shalt
thou behold my power". And thus addressed, the king, with his pride and
joy defeated, with his bow severed, and his steeds and charioteer
killed, himself smarting under shafts,--and having his crown
splintered,--speedily entered Lanka. And on that foe of the deities and
the Danavas--the puissant lord of the night-rangers--entering (into
Lanka), Rama rendered the monkeys along with Lakshmana hale in that
fierce conflict. And at the break-down of that foe of the immortals, the
celestials and the Asuras, the ghosts and the Cardinal points, and all
the mighty serpents together with the oceans and the creatures
inhabiting earth and water, felt exceedingly delighted.

SECTION LX.


And entering the city of Lanka, the king afflicted with the fear of
Rama's arrows, with his pride humbled, was undergoing great torments.
And overpowered by the high-souled Raghava, the king resembled an
elephant defeated by a lion or a serpent defeated by Garuda. And
remembering Raghava's arrows resembling a comet risen at the universal
wreck, and of the splendour of live lightning, the Rakshasa-chief was
aggrieved. And seated on a superb golden seat, Rama, eying the
Rakshasas, spoke,--"Forsooth all the austere asceticism I have performed
goeth for nothing, for although resembling the redoubtable Indra, I have
been overcome by a mortal. And this dire speech of Brahma also reverts
to my remembrance,--'Know thou that thy fear cometh from a human being.
Thou art incapable of being slain by deities and Danavas, Gandharvas,
Yakshas, Rakshasas and serpents. But thou hast not asked for immunity
from men.' And I deem even this son of Dacaratha as the occasion of my
fear. And I was formerly cursed by that lord of the Ikshwaku
line--Anaranya--saying,--'O worst of Rakshasas, a person shall spring in
my race, who, O wicked-minded one, shall slay thee in battle along with
thy sons and courtiers and forces and horses and charioteers.' And I was
also cursed by Vedavati, who was formerly outraged by me. And she is
(perchance) born as the exalted daughter of Janaka. And what had also
been uttered by Uma and Nandicwara and Rambha and Varuna's
daughter,[189] hath come to pass.[190] And taking note of this, ye
should strive (to the uttermost.) And let the Rakshasas be posted at the
gateways, highways, and the walls. And do ye wake up that destroyer of
the pride of the deities and the Danavas--Kumbhakarna, endowed with
unparalleled gravity, overwhelmed with the curse of Brahma". And seeing
himself worsted and Prahasta also slain, that Raksha endowed with
dreadful power issued his orders to that fearful force. "Do ye
vigilantly guard the gates and mount the wall. And do ye wake up
Kumbhakarna come under the sway of slumber. And deprived of his senses
through lust, he sleepeth secure. And the Rakshasa sometimes sleepeth
nine, seven, ten, or eight months away. Of measureless might he hath
slept for nine months. And foremost of all the Rakshasas in fight, that
long-armed one shall speedily slay the monkeys as well as the princes.
He is a very banner in battle, and the crown of all the Rakshas. But
intent on common pleasure, Kubhakarna, with his senses stupified,
sleepeth ever. I have been worsted in fierce fight by Rama; but on
Kumbhakarna being awakened, my grief shall go. If he doth not help me in
such high peril, what shall I do with his strength resembling the
strength of Sakra himself?" Hearing the speech of the lord of the
Rakshasas, the Rakshasas, bestirring themselves, went to the abode of
Kumbhakarna. And desired by Ravana, those feeding on flesh and blood
went off hurriedly, taking perfumes and wreaths and a mass of food. And
entering Kumbhakarna's charming cave having a wide gateway, measuring a
_yojana_ breathing around perfumes of flowers,--those highly powerful
ones, pushed off by Kumbhakarna's breath, with the utmost energy they
could summon up stood their ground and entered the cave. And then
entering that charming cave having floors paved with gold and gems,
those Nairitas endowed with great strength, saw that one of dreadful
prowess, lying down. And then they together set about waking up the
slumbering Kumbhakarna looking like a hill extended,--and sunk in
profound slumber; with his body having its down standing on end; lying
down; like a sighing serpent; rolling people[191] with his powerful
breath,--reposing; possessed of dreadful prowess; having a huge nose; of
a person vast as the nether sphere; lying stretched at length; smelling
of fat and blood; decked with golden _angadas_; and waring a diadem
endowed with the splendour of the Sun. And (they) saw that subduer of
enemies and foremost of Nairitas--Kumbhakarna. And then they piled up
Meru-like animals for conferring rare gratification, and heaps of deer
and buffaloes and boars. And the Rakshasas made an astounding heap of
rice. And then the enemies of the immortals put up before Kumbhakarna
jars of blood and various kinds of food, and smeared that repressor of
foes with excellent sandal, and made him inhale perfumes and the aroma
of wreaths. And they made (the place) rife with the incense of _dhupa_,
and extolled that smiter of enemies. And then the Yatudhanas roared
around here and there like clouds. And they winded conchs beaming
moon-like. And they incapable of being beaten shouted in full chorus.
And the night-rangers shouted and struck at their arms with their hands
and began to pull him. And for rousing Kumbhakarna, mighty was the din
that they raised. And hearing those loud sounds of conchs and drums and
_panavas_; and those proceeding from persons striking at their arms with
their hands; and leonine roars,--rushing on all sides and riving the
very heavens,--birds suddenly dropped down. And when the high-souled
Kumbhakarna sleeping soundly did not awake at that terrific tumult, the
Rakshasas took up _Bhushandis_[192] and maces. And then the Rakshasas,
drawing near, smote Kumbhakarna sleeping sweetly in the chest with
mountain-peaks, maces and clubs. But the Rakshasas could not stay before
Kumbhakarna owing to the hurricane heaving at his breath. Then
tightening their cloth[193] (about their waist), those Rakshasas of
dreadful prowess sounded _mridangas_ and _panavas_, conchs and kumbhas.
And ten thousand Rakshasas together surrounded that one resembling a
heap of dark-blue collyrium and fell to rousing him. But albeit assailed
with shouts and smit with weapons, he did not wake up. And when they
succeeded not in rousing him, they more than ever exerted themselves.
And then they smote him with horses and camels, and mules and snakes,
rods and lashes and hooks, and with might and main sounded kettledrums
and conchs and _mridangas_. And they struck his body with innumerable
huge blocks of wood. And summoning up their dearest energy, they dealt
him blows with maces and clubs. And at that mighty uproar, entire Lanka
was filled with her woods and hills; yet he did not wake up. And then
they simultaneously sounded a thousand kettle-drums beaten with sticks
of polished gold. And coming under the sway of the curse,[194] when that
one sunk in slumber did not wake up, the night-rangers were wrought up
with wrath. And overcome with choler, they endowed with dreadful prowess
addressed themselves vigorously to awakening him; and others put forth
their energy. And others smote the kettle-drums, and others set up loud
cries. And others cut off his hair, and others bit his ears. And others
poured into his ears a thousand vessels of water. But Kumbhakarna come
under the spell of a mighty slumber did not wink. And others--strong
ones--armed with poniards (_kutas_) and maces, made their poniards and
maces alight on his person. And struck with _sataghnis_ bound with
cords,[195] that huge-bodied one did not wake up. And then when a
thousand elephants rushed against his body, recovering his
consciousness, he awoke. And assailed with mountain-peaks and trees
descending on his body, he, without minding those tremendous blows,--on
sleep having been dispelled, suddenly got up, yawning,--suffering the
pangs of hunger. And then that night-ranger resembling an elephant or a
serpent or a mountain-peak, casting about his arms superior in force to
the thunder-bolt itself, and opening his deformed mouth like unto that
of a mule, yawned (again and again). And as he yawned, his mouth
resembling the subterraneous regions, looked like the Sun stationed at
the summit of Meru. And that night-ranger possessed of unwieldly
strength woke up, yawning. And the breath that he breathed resembled a
storm raging in a mountain. And then as he sat up, Kumbhakarna's form
appeared like that of the Destroyer himself at the universal
wreck,--intent upon consuming all creatures. And the large eyes of that
one, resembling a live flame and endowed with the splendour of
lightning, appeared like a pair of glowing planets. And then they
pointed unto him all those heaps of edibles, various and profuse,--bears
and buffaloes,--and that powerful (Rakshasa) fell to. And hungering, he
fed on flesh and athirst, drank blood. And then that enemy of Sakra
drank vesselfuls of fat and blood. And concluding that he was replete,
the night rangers came up; and bowing down their heads, stood circling
him on all sides. And then with his eyes discolored and drooping from
drowsiness, he casting his eyes around, addressed those night-rangers.
And that foremost of Nairitas cheered all those Nairitas; and surprised
at his having been roused,--spoke unto the Rakshasas,--"Why, being
honored, have I been awakened by you? Is it well with the king? Or hath
any fear sprung up here? Or hath a mighty fear presented itself forsooth
from among others; for which I have been speedily awakened by you? This
very day will I uproot quite the fear of the sovereign of the Rakshasas.
I will split up the great Indra himself,--or make Fire himself give up
his heat. One doth not awaken my like for a light cause. Therefore do ye
give the real truth of the cause of your awakening me". Thereat a
minister of the king, named Yupaksha, with joined hands said unto that
humbler of foes--Kumbhakarna--wrought up with wrath, who was thus
speaking,--"No fear anywise springs to us from the Deities. But, O king,
a great fear doth cross us, coming from a mortal. And never fear so
cometh unto us anywise from Daityas or Danavas, as it hath arrived from
a man, O king. This Lanka hath been hemmed in by monkeys resembling
mountains. And terrific is the terror that cometh even from Rama
scorched with fire springing from the ravishment of Sita. Ere this by a
single monkey was this splendid city burnt down. And the prince Aksha
hath been slain along with his following and elephants. And that thorn
in the sides of deities, that lord of the Rakshasas--Pulasta's son
himself--hath been set free in conflict by Raghava endowed with the
splendour of the Sun,--saying---'Go thou.' And what had been done unto
the king by neither the gods nor the Daityas nor yet the Danavas, hath
been done by Rama; and he hath been set free, having come to a pass
imperilling his life". Hearing Yupaksha's speech and hearing of the
defeat of his brother, Kumbhakarna, with his eyes whirling, spoke unto
him, saying,--"To day, O Yupaksha, after vanquishing in battle the
monkey-army together with Lakshmana and Raghava, shall I see Ravana. And
I shall regale the Rakshasas with the flesh and blood of the monkeys,
and myself drink the blood of Rama and Lakshmana". Hearing his words as
he haughtily spoke thus with his spirit of insolence magnified by much,
that foremost of the Nairita soldiers, Mahodara, with joined hands
observed,--"O long-armed one, having at first heard Ravana's words and
considered their justice or otherwise, thou wilt afterwards defeat the
foe in fight". Hearing Mahodara's words, the exceedingly energetic and
mighty (Kumbhakarna) surrounded by the Rakshasas, prepared to depart.
And having roused from his slumbers that one of terrific prowess having
dreadful eyes,--the Rakshasas speedily arrived at the residence of the
Ten-necked one. And presenting themselves before the Ten-necked one
seated on a superb seat, all the night-rangers spoke with joined
hands,--"O lord of the Rakshasas, thy brother, Kumbhakarna, hath been
roused. Shall he march from there; or wilt thou see him come here?"
Thereat, Ravana, pleased, spoke unto those Rakshasas who had presented
themselves,--"I wish to see him here, and do ye honor him fittingly".
Thereat, saying 'So be it', the Rakshasas, directed by Ravana, going
back, spoke unto Kumbhakarna,--"That foremost of all the Rakshasas--the
king--wisheth to see thee. So mind thou going, and gladden thy brother".
And the irrepressible Kumbhakarna possessed of prodigious prowess,
learning the mandate of his brother, saying,--'So be it,'--rose up from
his bed. And washing his face, and having bathed, that one, feeling
refreshed and enjoying exceeding exhilaration of spirit,--wishing to
drink, urged (the Rakshasas) to bring the nerve-conferring draught. And
then the Rakshasas, at the command of Ravana speedily procured wine and
various kinds of viands. And having drunk two thousand vessels (of
wine), he prepared to go. And slightly swolen and flushed, Kumbhakarna,
attaining access of strength and fire, waxed wroth, and resembled the
Doom and Destroyer--Yama himself. And striding to the residence of his
brother backed by the Raksha force, Kumbhakarna shook the earth with his
tread. And illuming the highway with the splendour of his person, like
the thousand-rayed (Sun) discovering the earth with his rays,
(Kumbhakarna) went on, engirt around by joined hands resembling
wreaths,--like Satakratu[196] going to the abode of the Self-sprung. And
suddenly seeing that slayer of foes of immeasurable prowess, resembling
a mountain-summit,--walking along the highways, the wood-rangers
stationed outside (the monkey-camp), along with the leaders of bands,
were seized with affright. And then some sought the shelter of Rama,
worthy of being so sought; and some, stricken (with panic), dropped to
the earth; and some, suffering (from fear), lied to the cardinal points;
and some through stress (of apprehension) lay down on the ground. And
seeing that one resembling a very mountain-peak, decked with a diadem,
seeming to touch the Sun himself with his energy, of colossal altitude,
and wonderful to behold,--the wood-rangers, tormented with fright, began
to scamper on all sides.

[189] Punjikasthala.

[190] Punjikasthala cursed Ravana that he should come by death if he
      should use violence on a woman against her inclination. Ravana had
      _not_ been cursed by Rambha herself, but by Nala Kuvera in _her_
      interest. 'Thy head shall be sundered in seven when thou forcest a
      female against her will.' Uma had cursed Ravana that for a woman
      he should meet with death on the shaking of the peak of
      Kailaca.--Nandicwara had cursed him that as he had slighted and
      scoffed at him, he should find his fate at the hands of the
      monkeys, being emanations of himself.--T.

SECTION LXI.


And then the exceedingly energetic Rama possessed of prowess, taking his
bow, saw Kumbhakarna, having a huge body and decked with a diadem. And
seeing that foremost of Rakshasas looking like a mountain; filling all
the heavens as formerly Narayana had done; resembling clouds charged
with rain; and adorned with golden _angadas_,--the mighty army of
monkeys began to run away at the top of its speed. Seeing the army
scamper and the Rakshasa swelling, Rama struck with surprise, said unto
Bibhishana,--"Who is that tawney-eyed one, decked with a diadem, and
looking like a hill? And in Lanka the hero appeareth like a mass of
clouds embosoming lightning. And alone he seemeth like an ensign of the
Earth; and seeing him the monkeys dart away hither and thither. Tell me
who he is,--whether a Raksha or an Asura. The like of him mine eyes had
never before lighted on". Accosted by the king's son--Rama of untiring
deeds--the exceedingly wise Bibhishana said unto Kakutstha,--"By whom in
battle Vivascwata's offspring[197] and Vasava himself had been
vanquished, this is he--the wondrous powerful Kumbhakarna--son unto
Vicravan. No Rakshasa is there that equalleth this one in size. O
Raghava, this one in battle hath brought down Danavas and Yakshas and
Serpents[198] and flesh-feeders and Gandharvas and Vidyadharas and
Pannagas[199] by thousands. The immortals themselves thinking the
dart-handed and fierce-eyed Kumbhakarna possessed of great strength, as
the Destroyer himself,--were overwhelmed with stupor and were foiled in
their exertions to slay him. The exceedingly powerful Kumbhakarna is
mighty by nature: the strength of other redoubtable Rakshasas is owing
to boons obtained by them. As soon as this high-souled one was born and
was a babe, he began to devour up countless creatures by the thousand.
And on these having been devoured, creatures, afflicted with affright
consequent on those having been eaten up, sought the shelter of Sakra
and told him what had happened. And thereat the great Indra, waxing
wroth, smote Kumbhakarna with the whetted levin. And hit at with Sakra's
thunderbolt, that high-souled (hero) shook, and in wrath set up roars.
And hearing the roars of the Rakshasa--Kumbhakarna--as he kept crying,
creatures, seized with fear, were greatly agitated. And thereat, enraged
with the great Indra, the mighty Kumbhakarna plucking a tusk of
Airavata, hurled it at Vasava's chest. And with blood overflowing his
person, Vasava looked as if aflame. And thereat, all of a sudden the
gods and the Brahmarshis and the Danavas were dispirited. And then they
informed the lord of creatures touching the ravages of Kumbhakarna, and
informed the gods about Kumbhakarna's devouring up creatures, destroying
asylums and outraging others' wives. "If this one devour creatures
constantly, in a short space the world would be empty of any". Hearing
Vasava's speech, the Great-father of all called up[200] the Rakshasas
and saw Kumbhakarna (before him). And seeing Kumbhakarna, Prajapati[201]
was seized with exceeding great fear. And then, pacifying Kumbhakarna,
the Self-sprung addressed him, saying,--"Forsooth for compassing the
destruction of creatures, hast thou been begot by Paulasta.[202]
Therefore from this day forth, thou shalt lie down as one dead".
Stricken with the curse of Brahma, Kumbhakarna fell down before the
Lord. Then, extremely agitated, Ravana said,--"Thou hewest down a golden
tree when about to bear fruit. O lord of creatures, thou ought not to
curse thus thine own grandson. Thy words will never go for naught; sleep
he will, without doubt. But do thou appoint a time for his sleeping and
one for his awaking". Hearing Ravana's speech, the Self-sprung
said,--"Having slept for six months, he shall wake for one day. And for
a single day, that hero, coming under the influence of hunger, shall
range the earth, opening his mouth wide open, and devouring people like
a fire that hath spread far and wide. And now king Ravana struck with
terror at thy prowess, encompassed with peril, hath waked up
Kumbhakarna. And that hero possessed of dreadful prowess, wrought up
with high wrath, sallying forth from his camp, rusheth about, eating up
monkeys. And soon as the monkeys see Kumbhakarna, they fly away. And How
can they resist in battle the enraged Kumbhakarna? Do thou tell the
monkeys this is an uplifted engine. Thus assured, the monkeys shall take
heart". Hearing Bibhishana's words informed with reason and tending to
the good (of the monkeys), Raghava then addressed general Nila;
saying,--"Let you, monkeys, equipped with weapons and holding hill-tops
in your hands,--and furnished with mountain-summits and trees and rocks,
stay, occupying the highways and the bridges". Thus instructed by
Raghava, that powerful monkey, Nila--general of the forces--accordingly
issued his orders to the monkey-hosts. And then Givaksha and Sarabha and
Hanuman and Angada, themselves endowed with the splendour of
mountain-summits, taking up mountain-tops, drew towards the gateway. And
hearing Rama's words,[203] the heroic monkeys inspired with intrepidity,
fiercely fell on the foe with trees. And then that dreadful army of
monkeys, upraising crags and holding trees in their hands, appeared like
mighty masses of scowling clouds bordering a mountain.[204]

SECTION LXII.


And that tiger-like Rakshasa possessed of prowess, (still) under the
influence of slumber, strode along the picturesque highway. And that
exceedingly unconquerable one, surrounded by thousands of Rakshasas,
went on, showered with blossoms from the houses (standing by). And then
he saw the grand and graceful residence of the lord of the Rakshasas,
having golden networks and sun-bright to behold. And entering the
mansion of the Rakshasa sovereign, like the sun entering into a mass of
clouds, he saw his elder brother seated at a distance; even as Sakra
sees the Self-sprung seated. And Kumbhakarna surrounded by numbers of
Rakshasas, entered his brother's abode, making the very earth tremble
with his tread. And arriving at the abode and passing the entrance, he
saw his superior anxiously seated on the car, Pusphaka. Seeing
Kumbhakarna come, the Ten-necked one, exceedingly rejoiced, raised him
up and drew him near himself. And then the exceedingly mighty
Kumbhakarna saluted the feet of his brother and said,--"What dost thou
say?" Thereat, delighted, Ravana, springing up, again embraced (his
brother). And embraced (by his brother), and duly greeted by him, that
brother (of Ravana)--Kumbhakarna seated himself on a shining and superb
seat. And seating himself on that seat, the wondrous powerful
Kumbhakarna, with his eyes reddened in wrath, addressed Ravana,
saying,--"O king, why, honoring me, hast thou awaked me? Tell me, whence
springeth thy fear? And who shall be a ghost?"[205] Thereat, Ravana,
waxing wroth, and with his eyes rolling in rage, said unto Kumbhakarna,
seated,--"O highly powerful one, thou hast slept away a long space of
time. And having been asleep, thou dost not know the great fear of mine
springing from Rama. This graceful son unto Dacaratha possessed of
strength, along with Sugriva, having crossed the ocean, is destroying
our race. Alack! see in own Lanka, woods and forests have been flooded
with an ocean of monkeys coming without any ado by the bridge (which
they have constructed). Those Rakshasas that were prime, have been slain
in battle by the monkeys; but I find no destruction of the monkeys in
fight. Nay, the monkeys have never been before even vanquished (by the
Rakshasas) in battle. And therefore hath this fear sprung up (in my
heart). Save me from this, O exceedingly powerful one. Do thou now
destroy these. It is for this that I have roused thee. Do thou, favoring
me, whose exchequer is empty, save this city of Lanka, having only young
folks and the aged left. And, O long-armed one, do thou perform thy
dearest acts in behalf of thy brother. And, O subduer of enemies, I had
never before said so unto my brother. In thee is my affection and great
is the probability of thy succeeding. In the wars of the celestials and
Asuras, O foremost of Rakshasas, countless were the celestials that thou
as an antagonist hadst beaten. Therefore, O thou of dreadful strength,
summon thy entire energy. Him find I not among all beings, who is thy
peer in prowess. And, O lover of battle! O dear unto friends, as thou
likest, do this beloved good office, this prime benefit, unto me. By thy
own energy, smite the hostile hosts, even as a mighty and strong wind
(scattereth away) autumnal clouds.

[205] _Having been slain by me._



SECTION LXIII.


Hearing the lament of the king of Rakshasas, Kumbhakarna, laughing,
said,--"That evil which on the occasion of the conclave we had seen,
hath befallen thee, who hast passed by what was fraught with thy good.
Even as a sinner reapeth perdition, verily hath the fruit of thine
unrighteous act found thee. At first, O mighty king, thou didst not
ponder over this course of conduct; nor, from pride of prowess, didst
thou at all take note of the evil thereof. He that doeth last what
should be done first, and first what should be done last, is ignorant of
what is prudence and what not. Acts not performed in harmony with season
and place, like unto acts performed counter to season and place, are the
occasions of misery, and resemble clarified butter poured into fire that
hath not been sanctified. He stayeth well in the path that, in
consultation with his counsellors, ascertained the five ways touching
the three kinds of action.[206] The king that aided by his own
intelligence as well as his counsellors acteth after reflection in
consonance with the science of polity, that distinguished his friends
(from his foes), and, lord of the Rakshasas, that seasonably[207]
pursueth righteousness, or profit, or desire,--or any two, or all these
combined,--truly hath understanding.[208] But the king or the
heir-apparent, that, having heard what is prime among the three, doth
not understand, hath spent his time in vain on his erudition. He that,
controlling his own self, consulteth with his counsellors seasonably
touching gift, forbearance, difference and prowess, as well as virtue,
profit and desire,--doth not in this world come by calamity. Perceiving
the fair fruit (of a line of action) accruing to him here, a king should
act in consultation with counsellors endowed with intelligence and
versed in the import of things. Not understanding the sense of the
scriptures, persons possessed of beastly intelligence,--entering into
the heart of their counsellors,--are inspired with a desire of speaking
out of sheer volubility.[209] Albeit uttered needfully, the speech of
those that are ignorant of learning and the knowledge of the sense of
things,--and who are intent upon attaining abounding affluence,--should
not be acted upon. And those--spoilers of business--who from
recklessness talk of pernicious as if profitable,--should certainly be
rejected as counsellors. Some counsellors--destroyers of their
masters--joining intelligent enemies (of their lords), act in a way
opposed to their interests in this world. Their lords, at the hour of
consultation, by their behaviour should know these counsellors--enemies
in the guise of friends--who have been won over (by the opposite party).
Even as the fowls of the air enter the hole in the Krauncha,[210]
enemies find an easy entrance into the shortcomings of him that is
fickle[211] and that rusheth into act without heed. He that disregarding
his foe, omitteth to guard himself, cometh by disasters and loseth his
place. Even what had been advanced by thy beloved[212] and my younger
brother, is fraught with our welfare. Do thou now what thou wishest".
Hearing Kumbhakarna's words, the Ten-necked one knit up his brows, and,
wrought up with wrath, said unto him,--"I am worthy of being honored by
thee, like thy superior. What needs this verbal travail? Do thou what is
fit. Vain is the mention now of what I did either through stupor or
delusion or pride of prowess. Now bethink thee of what is proper. Do
thou through thy prowess assuage the sorrow of mine springing from my
impolitic conduct, if thou cherishest any feeling for me, if thy
strength stayeth, and if thou deemest this business of mine as by far
more momentous unto thee. He is a friend that succoureth one fallen in
distress and is undergoing affliction; and he acts friendly that helpeth
a person lapsing from the path of morality". As he was speaking thus in
words sedate yet severe, Kumbhakarna, concluding that Ravana was
delighted, made his remarks mildly. And seeing his brother extremely
sorry, Kumbhakarna, pacifying him, gently said,--"O king, intently hear
my words, O repressor of foes! O lord of Rakshasas, banish this sorrow,
and casting away thy wrath, return thou to nature. And, O king, so long
as I live, thou must not suffer thy heart to fare thus. Him will I slay
for whom thou grievest. But whatever condition thou mayst be in, I must
tell what is for thy welfare; and therefore from sentiment of friendship
as well as from fraternal affection I have spoken thus unto thee, O
king. And what a friend from affection should do at a time like this, I
shall do the same. See the havock I spread among the foes in fight. And,
O long-armed one, behold, on Rama having been slain by me on the edge of
battle along with his brother, the monkey-army in headlong flight. And
to-day seeing Rama's head brought by me from the field, be thou, O
long-armed one, happy; and let Sita be overwhelmed with woe. And let
those Rakshasas in Lanka who have had their kindred slain (in battle),
see that dear sight--Rama slain (in fight). And to-day shall I slaying
the enemies in battle, wipe the tears of those who mourn their friends
slain and are overwhelmed with grief. To-day behold the lord of
monkeys--Sugriva--resembling a mountain or a mass of clouds lighted up
by (the living) sun,--lying stretched on the field. But why, O sinless
one, albeit comforted by these Rakshasas eager for slaying Dacaratha's
son, as well as by me,--dost thou persist in thy sorrow? Raghava
forsooth shall slay thee after slaying me. But, O lord of Rakshasas, I
cannot come by grief[213] (at Raghava's hands). O repressor of foes, do
thou now command me, O thou of unparalleled prowess, thou needst not
thyself face the foe in fight. I shall abolish thy foes endowed with
redoubted might. If even Sakra himself, and Yama, and the god of Fire,
and the god of Wind, and Kuvera, and Varuna--shall range themselves
against me, them shall I encounter in fight. Purandara himself is seized
with fright at sight of me, having a body measuring a
mountain,--equipped with sharpened spears,--furnished with sharp
teeth,--and setting up shouts. And who wishing to save himself shall be
able to stay before me as I casting away my weapons keep pounding my
enemies with celerity? No need of the dart, or the mace, or the sword,
or whetted arrows. I shall with my bare arms alone slay (Rama) along
with the thunderer himself. If Raghava bear the impetus of my blows,
then shall the vollies of my shafts drink his life-blood. Why, O king,
while I remain, dost thou burn in anxiety? And I am ready to sally out
for compassing the destruction of thine enemies. Cast off all terror of
Rama. I shall slay in battle Raghava and Lakshmana and the exceedingly
powerful Sugriva and the Raksha-destroying Hanuman, who made Lanka
blaze. I shall eat up the monkeys present in the encounter. And signal
is the celebrity that I shall confer on thee. And, O king, if thy fear
springs from Indra or the Self-create, even the immortals shall measure
their lengths on the earth when I am wrought with rage. And I shall
subdue Yama himself and devour the God of Fire. And I shall bring down
the very welkin garnished with stars. And I shall slay Satakratu and
drink up the abode itself[214] of Varuna. And I shall crush the
mountains and rive the earth. And to day let all creatures as they are
being eaten up, witness the prowess of Kumbhakarna, after he hath slept
for a long time. Even the celestial regions do not suffice for me as my
fare. I go for securing felicity ushuring in pleasures plenteous flowing
from the destruction of Dacaratha's son. And slaying Rama along with
Lakshmana, I shall eat up all the foremost of monkey-bands. Make merry,
my king; to-day drink Varuni. Enjoy pleasures, banishing sorrow. And
to-day on my having despatched Rama to the mansion of Yama, Sita shall
come under thy control for good".

Hearing the speech of the huge-bodied, long-armed and mighty
Kumbhakarna, Mahodara said,--"O Kumbhakarna, although sprung in a noble
line, thou art wondrous haughty and of a vulgar form; and thou art not
everywhere competent to discern thy course. It certainly cannot well be
that the king cannot distinguish between proper and improper; but thou
hast from thy youth upwards been insolent; and thy joy is in talking
perenially. But the foremost of the Rakshasas is versed in place and
increase and injury,--and knoweth the duties touching season and
place,--and how to advance his own party and lower that of the foe. But
what person ever acteth according to what is proposed feebly[215] by one
having strength, yet of inferior intelligence, and who hath never
respected the aged? And thou art not naturally competent to understand
what thou thyself sayest touching the opposed virtue, profit and desire.
Verily action is the spring of all agencies of happiness or misery; and
it is only those that act either well or ill that reap the results of
their acts. Virtue,[216] and interest[217] bring about emancipation as
well as heaven and prosperity. But evil cometh from unrighteousness and
harms spring therefrom.[218] People reap the fruit of their acts in this
world or the next; but the fruit of desire is reaped readily. Therefore
should a king set about attaining his desire. And this also had we
advised thee with our soul. And what is the harm that one should display
his prowess before a foe? Dost thou show the reasons for thy taking the
field alone? But I shall point thee out what is improper and
unreasonable in this (proposed) course. How shalt thou alone vanquish
that Raghava who formerly routed in Janasthana innumerable Rakshasas
possessed of exceeding strength? Dost thou not to-day in the palace
behold those powerful Rakshasas that had been beaten in
Janasthana,--cowed down in fear? Alas! thou wishest to awake Rama,--son
unto Dacaratha--knowing full well that he resembles an enraged lion or a
sleeping serpent. But whom doth it behove to confront him ever flaming
in energy, difficult of being approached when enraged,--and unbearable
even like Death himself? On approaching the foe, this whole host itself
shall be imperilled; and therefore, my child, thy marching alone doth
nowise recommend itself to me. Who is there that, albeit weak bent on
renouncing his life, wisheth to bring under subjection a foe that is
powerful,--as if he would act with reference to one that is inferior? O
foremost of Rakshasas, why dost thou wish to fight with him whose peer
there is none among men, and who is equal to Indra and Vivacwata
himself?" Having said this unto Kumbhakarna wrought up with wrath,
Mahodara addressed that destroyer of creatures--Ravana--in the midst of
the Rakshasas,--"Having already obtained Vaidehi, why dost thou delay?
If thou wishest it, Sita shall come under thy control. I have perceived
a way as to how Sita may smile upon thee. Do thou listen; and should it
please thee, act thou accordingly. Do thou proclaim it about that I and
Dwijibha and Sanhradi, and Kumbhakarna and Vitardana--these five--are
marching for compassing the destruction of Rama. And we, marching out,
shall battle with Rama, putting forth our uttermost. And if we succeed
in securing victory, no expedient need we resort to (or bringing Sita
round). But if our foe live after fight and we also having fought the
fight, then shall we do what I conceive in my mind. We shall come hither
from the field, bathed in blood, and having our bodies cleft with arrows
marked with the name of Rama. And we shall give out that both Rama and
Lakshmana have been eaten up by us. And then we shall hold thy feet,
saying,--'Do thou gratify us.' Then, king, do thou through Gajaskandha
publish it all round that Rama hath been slain along with his brother
and the army. And, O repressor of foes, (pretending to be) well pleased,
do thou dispense--viands, and servants, and objects of enjoyments, and
wealth unto thy retainers; and unto the many heroes and warriors
distribute wreaths and attires and unguents. And do thou (simulating)
delight, drink. And on this report--name that Rama hath been eaten up by
the Rakshasas along with his friends,--having spread round and round and
entering (the acoka wood), and soothing and pacifying Sita in solitude,
allure her with corn and riches and gems. By this deceit, O king,
working powerfully through Sita's sorrow, she, albeit unwilling, shall,
having lost her lord, come under thy control. Losing her charming
husband, she from despair and female frailty, shall come under thy sway.
Having formerly been brought up in happiness, she, although worthy of
felicity, (ultimately) had come by misfortune. And now finding happiness
to be in thy custody, she shall unreservedly come over to thee. In my
opinion this is the properest course to follow. As soon as thou seest
Rama, evil shall befall thee. Remain here. Do not wish (to go to the
field). By refraining from fight, thou shalt acquire great good. And, O
lord of people, by conquering the foe without battle, thou without
losing thy forces and putting thyself to peril, thou, O lord of earth,
shalt attain fame and high religious merit, and prosperity and renown
for ever and for ever.

[215] _Vaktum acakyam--incapable of saying_. But what sense can be
      attached to--"What man acteth according to what is _not_ advanced
      by one having strength......aged?" I therefore venture to render
      the passage--_feebly proposed--i.e. proposed with vascillation or
      half-heartedly.--T._

[218] _Dharma_, remarks Ramanuja, is here used for contemplation and

SECTION LXV.


Thus addressed, Kumbhakarna rebuking Mahodara, said unto that foremost
of Rakshasa--his brother--Ravana,--"Even I shall remove thy great fear
by slaying the wicked-minded Rama. On thy foe having been slain, attain
thou ease. It is not for naught that the heroes roar, like unto clouds
containing no rain.[219] Behold thou their roaring resulting in action
in the field! Heroes do not vaunt; but without boasting of their prowess
in speech, they perform feats difficult of being achieved. O Mahodara,
what thou sayest is ever acceptable only to kings that are incompetent,
and foolish, pluming themselves on their knowledge. All the affairs of
the monarch have been wrecked by you--cravens in
fight,--sleek-tongued,--following the king (fawning) ye have made Lanka
contain only the king, the treasury is lean; and the forces have been
slain. By the king ye have done like foes in the guise of friends. For
repairing in mighty conflict the wrong that ye have perpetrated, I am
about to set out for battle for routing the enemy". Thus addressed by
the intelligent Kumbhakarna, the lord of Rakshasas, laughing
answered,--"Sure this Mahodara is affrighted at Rama. And therefore, my
child, O thou versed in warfare, he doth not relish battle. Like thee
have I none either in friendship or strength. Therefore, O Kumbhakarna,
go for destroying the foe and securing celebrity. I have waked thee up
that wast lying down, in order that thou mightst destroy the enemy. O
subduer of foes, perilous is the time for the Rakshasas. Go forth,
grasping thy spear, like the noose-handed Destroyer himself. Do thou
devour up the monkeys as well as the princes possessed of the energy of
the Sun himself. On seeing thy form, the monkeys shall flee away; and
the breasts of Rama and Lakshmana shall be riven". Having spoken thus
unto Kumbhakarna endowed with prodigious might, that foremost of
Rakshasas--the exceedingly energetic Ravana--felt as if he had received
life over again. And well acquainted with Kumbhakarna's might, and
knowing his prowess, the king felt delighted, like the cloudless Moon.
Having been thus accosted, that highly powerful one, went out
cheerfully.[220] And hearing the king's speech, he made ready for fight.
And he took a whetted dart, destructive to foes on account of its
impetuous vehemence; entirely made of black iron; flaming; decorated
with garniture, of shining gold; looking like Indra's _acani_; ponderous
as the thunder-bolt; capable of destroying gods and Danavas, Gandharvas,
Yakshas and Pannagas; adorned with festoons of crimson flowers; and
belching forth flames. And taking that huge dart decked with the blood
of foes; the wondrous energetic Kumbhakarna spoke unto Ravana,
saying,--"I shall go alone: let this mighty host remain here. To-day
hungry and enraged, I shall devour up the monkeys. Hearing Kumbhakarna's
words, Ravana said,--"Go thou, surrounded by the forces bearing darts
and maces in their hands. The monkeys are high-souled, heroic and
well-skilled in battle; and if they find thee alone or unwary, they may
slay thee with their teeth. Therefore do thou exceedingly irrisistible,
go, environed by the forces; and destroy the entire party of the foes,
who are bent upon doing harm unto the Rakshas". Then starting up from
his seat, the exceedingly energetic Ravana hung on Kumbhakarna's neck a
wreath stringed with gems in the centre. And Ravana also decked that
high-souled one with _angadas_, and finger-fences, and noble ornaments,
and a chain resembling the Moon. And Ravana adorned his person with
garlands gorgeous and fragrant, and set ear-rings to his ears. And
adorned with golden _angadas_ and Keyuras and other ornaments of gold,
the large-eared Kumbhakarna appeared like a fire fed full of sacrificial
libations. And with his great dark girdle he seemed like the Mandara
fastened by the serpent on the occasion of the churning of the sea. And
donning on his impenetrable golden mail, splendid like lightning, and
shining in its own brilliance, Kumbhakarna appeared like the monarch of
mountains enveloped with evening clouds. Having all his limbs adorned
with ornaments and bearing a dart in his hand, the Rakshasa resembled
Narayana in elation of spirits, when he covered heaven and earth and the
nether regions with three paces. And then embracing his brother and
going round him and bowing down the head unto him, that exceedingly
powerful one went out. And Ravana sent him with choice
benedictions,--while he caused kettle-drums and conchs to be sounded and
forces equipped with excellent weapons, to accompany Kumbhakarna. And
high-souled mighty warriors followed that foremost of heroes with
elephants and steeds and chariots sending out rattle resembling the
rumbling of thunder. And mounting serpents and camels and asses and
lions and leopards and deer and birds, (Rakshasas) followed the grim
Kumbhakarna endowed with tremendous strength. And strewn with blossoms,
and, with an umbrella held over him, that exceedingly terrible enemy of
the Deities and the Danavas, wielding a dart in his hand,--went out,
maddened with the smell of blood. And countless footmen wondrous
powerful and mighty and dreadful and fierce-sighted Rakshasas, carrying
weapons in their hands, went in his wake. The Rakshas measuring each
many a _vyama_ and red-eyed, and resembling masses of dark-blue
collyrium,--went out upraising darts and swords and sharpened axes and
_bhindipalas_ and _parighas_ and maces and huge _talaskandhas_ and
irrisistible _Kshapanis_. And the exceedingly energetic Kumbhakarna
endowed with prodigious strength sallied forth, assuming another form
terrific and dreadful to behold. And the gigantic huge-faced and fierce
Kumbhakarna, measuring an hundred bows in breadth and six hundred in
altitude, having eyes resembling car-wheels, and resembling a towering
hill, or a mountain burnt,--marshalling the Rakshas, said with a
complacent countenance,--"Like fire consuming insects, shall I to-day,
wrought up with wroth, burn up one by one the bands of the flower of the
monkey-forces. But the wood-ranging monkeys have not transgressed
anywise unto the like of us. That species is the ornament of the gardens
attached to our residences. The cause of the seige of the city is
Raghava along with Lakshmana. He being slain, all are slain. Therefore
shall I slay him in battle". As the Raksha--Kumbhakarna--was speaking
thus, the Rakshasas sent up terrific shouts, as if making the very sea
shake. As the intelligent Kumbhakarna sallied out speedily, dreadful
were the omens that presented themselves on all sides. Clouds containing
meteors and lightning looked dark like asses. And the earth shook with
her oceans and woods. And fierce jackals began to cry, opening their
flaming mouths. And birds began to wheel at the left. And as he marched
a vulture alighted on his dart. And his left eye throbbed and his left
arm shook. And a meteor dropped down with a tremendous crash. And the
sun was bedimmed, and the air did not blow, enhancing pleasure. But
without heeding these mighty omens that took place, capabale of making
people's down stand on end, Kumbhakarna went out, urged on by the force
of the Finisher. And leaping over the wall with his legs, that one
resembling a mountain saw the wonderful array of the monkeys, resembling
clouds. And seeing that foremost of Rakshasas resembling a hill, the
monkeys began to disperse in all the ten cardinal directions like clouds
driven by the wind. And seeing that terrific host of monkeys scattering
in all directions, like clouds broken through (by winds), Kumbhakarna
possessed of the splendour of clouds, from joy, emitted roars like
clouds. Hearing those terrible shouts like unto the roaring of clouds in
the welkin, innumerable monkeys dropped to the earth even as _sala_
trees that have their roots severed. And issuing forth for destroying
the foe, the high-souled Kumbhakarna, equipped with a tremendous
bludgeon, struck extreme terror into the monkey-ranks, like unto the
Lord armed with the Fatal rod at the Universal wreck.

[219] _i.e._ autumnal clouds and which roar but do not pour.--T.

[220] He did not, however go yet awhile.--T.



SECTION LXVI.


Having leapt over the wall, the exceedingly powerful and gigantic
Kumbhakarna resembling a mountain-summit, speedily went out of the city.
And then he sent up a mighty shout making the sea resound, and as if
drowning the roar of the thunder and riving mountains. And seeing that
fierce-eyed one, incapable of being vanquished by Maghavan or Varuna or
Yama, the monkeys began to fly away. And seeing them scamper, the king's
son--Angada--said unto Nala and Nila and Gavaksha and the mighty
Kumuda,--"Forgetting your lineage and prowess, whither do ye, exercised
with fear, fly,--like inferior monkeys? Ye amiable ones, desist. Why
should ye save yourselves? This Raksha doth not come to fight,--this is
only a great phenomenon to affright. We shall by our vigor destroy this
fearful phenomenon of the Rakshasas that hath presented itself.
Therefore, let the monkeys desist. Cheered with much ado, the monkeys
rallying, took up trees and advanced to the field of fight. And ceasing
from flight, the wood-rangers waxing enraged, began to assail
Kumbhakarna, like unto elephants in rut. And the exceedingly strong[221]
Kumbhakarna, attacked with towering mountain-peaks and crags and trees
with flowering top, did not shake. And countless crags descending on his
person, were shattered; and trees with flowering tops, being broken,
fell down to the earth. And incapable of containing himself (through
rage), Kumbhakarna on his part fell to agitating the ranks of the
powerful monkeys, even as a fire breaking out burneth down a forest. And
many a prime monkey, crimsoned and drenched (with blood) lay down (on
the ground); and many, resisted dropped to the earth, like trees bearing
coppery flowers. And without looking before or after, the monkeys
bounded and rushed. And on being attacked by the Rakshasa with ease some
of those heroes dropped into the deep, and some entered the wilderness.
And some ran by the same way by which they had crossed the ocean; and
some with pale faces darted into downs. And some of the bears ascended
up trees, and some took shelter in mountains. And others dropped[222]
down; and some ran on. And some fell down to the earth, and some lay
insensible[223] as if dead. Seeing the monkeys break down, Angada
addressed them, saying,--"Stay we shall fight. Desist, ye monkeys. Going
round this Earth place find I none where ye may rest. Stop ye all. What
is the need of preserving your lives. Ye poltroons, if ye fly away
leaving your arms behind, your wives shall deride you; and that is more
painful to honorable persons than death itself. Born in long and noble
lines, whither go ye, suffering from fear, like abject monkeys? When
renouncing your prowess, ye fly away in fear, forsooth ye are base.
Where now is gone that talk of yours anent your nobility and the welfare
(of your king) which you had held in society. He that liveth, despised
(of all), hear the reproach of being a craven. Therefore do ye follow
the way frequented by the worthy, and cast off fear. We will either lie
down on the earth, being slain in consequence of our shortness of days,
and thus attain the region of Brahma incapable of being attained by
dastards; or achieve renown by slaying the foe in fight and slain in
battle, we shall enjoy the wealth of the region of heroes. Like an
insect coming to a glowing and flaming fire, Kumbhakarna, seeing
Kakutstha, shall not away hence living. If we save our lives by flight,
and if the many are brought down by one, we shall lose our fame
utterly". As Angada decked in golden _angadas_ was saying this, the
monkeys, flying away spake onto that hero words not worthy of being
spoken unto an hero,--"Great is the havoc that the
Rakshasa--Kumbhakarna--hath spread amongst us. 'Tis not the time to
stay: life is dear unto us". Having said this the monkey-bands darted to
the ten cardinal points; as they saw that dreadful and grim-eyed one
approach. And as those flower of the forces were on the flight, those
heroes were made to desist by Angada with words of comfort and hope
pointing to the future. On being cheered by the intelligent son of Vali,
all the monkey-bands stood expecting his commands.

[221] _Mahavalah--plu_--evidently a misprint for _mahavalah_--sing.--T.

[222] _For fighting_, remarks the commentator.

[223] _Suptah--sleeping_; but here, I presume, it means _senseless_.--T.



SECTION LXVII.


And having desisted on hearing the words of Angada, those huge-bodied
ones, regaining calmness, became (again) intent on fight. And attaining
energy at the exhortation (of Angada), and summoning up their prowess,
they stayed in the field agreeably to the words of the powerful Angada.
And inspired with spirits, the monkeys, determined to face their fate,
rushed into the conflict, and, casting away all care for their lives,
entered into a furious fight (with the foe). And speedily upraising
trees and gigantic crags, the huge-bodied monkeys charged Kumbhakarna.
Thereat the mighty Kumbhakarna possessed of a prodigious person waxing
wroth, taking up his mace let the same alight on the enemies. And
attacked by Kumbhakarna, seven, eight hundreds and thousands of monkeys
measure their lengths on the earth. And casting about his arms, he
rusheth on, devouring sixteen, eight, ten, twenty or thirty. And he
devoured (the monkeys) like Garuda swallowing up serpents. And then
cheered up with much ado, the monkeys meeting together, and taking trees
and rocks in their hands, stood their ground in the van of battle. Then
uprooting a crag, Dwivida--foremost of monkeys--resembling an extended
mass of clouds rushed against (Kumbhakarna) having the aspect of a
mountain-summit. And uprooting it, the monkey hurled it at Kumbhakarna.
And without descending on him, the crag fell down amidst the army, and
smashed steeds and elephants and cans and choice chargers. And then
taking another mountain top, Dwivida hurled it at other Rakshas. And
smit with the impetus of the peak, Kumbhakarna had his chargers and his
charioteers slain; and the terrific field overflowed with the blood of
Rakshas. And Rakshasa car-warriors by means of arrows resembling the
Destroyer himself, cut off the heads of the foremost monkeys who had
been setting up roars. And the high-souled monkeys also, uprooting
giants trees, destroyed cars and horses and elephants and camels and
Rakshasas.--And remaining in the sky, Hanuman discharged at
Kumbhakarna's head mountain-peaks and rocks and various trees. And all
those mountain-tops he cut off with his dart; and the mighty Kumbhakarna
also baffled the shower of trees.--Then grasping his sharpened spear,
Kumbhakarna darted against that terrific array of monkeys. And as he
charged them, Hanuman armed with a mountain-peak, stood before him. And
waxing enraged (Hanuman) vehemently smote Kumbhakarna with a gigantic
crag. And overpowered by that, Kumbhakarna experienced great torments,
and his body was covered with fat and blood. And then as Guha had
pierced Krauncha with his fierce dart, Kumbhakarna the mountain-like
smote the Wind-god's son in the chest with his dart resembling lightning
or like a glowing mountain-summit. And having his mighty chest pierced
in the mighty encounter, Hanuman, overwhelmed, and vomitting
blood,--transported with wrath, set up roars resembling the roaring of
the clouds at the universal disruption. And then, beholding him in
torments, the Rakshas suddenly rejoiced, emitted shouts; and the monkeys
aggrieved and overcome with fright, began to fly Kumbhakarna in battle.
And then the powerful Nila, arranging his forces, discharged a
mountain-peak at the intelligent Kumbhakarna. And seeing it descend, he
dealt it a blow; and struck by the blow, the mountain-top was shattered
in pieces; and dropped to the earth glowing and shooting living flames.
And then Rishabha and Sarabha and Nila and Gavaksha and
Gandhamadana--these five terrific monkeys--rushed against Kumbhakarna.
And in the encounter those mighty monkeys began to sorely assail the
huge-bodied Kumbhakarna with crags and trees and slaps and kicks and
blows. But those blows seemed to him like touches[224] and did not at
all pain him. Then he fastened the vehement Rishabha with his arms. And
agonised on being fastened with Kumbhakarna's arms, that foremost of
monkeys, the dreadful Rishabha, fell down to the earth, vomitting blood
by his mouth. And then the enemy of Indra smit, Sarabha with blow, and
Nila, in the conflict with his thigh, struck a slap at Gavaksha. And
suffering great pain in consequence of the blows (dealt by Kumbhakarna
those monkeys), deprived of their senses and bathed in blood, dropped
down to the earth like Kincukas that have been cut down. And on those
high-souled and mighty monkeys falling down, thousands of monkeys rushed
at Kumbhakarna. And ascending a mountain-summit, those foremost of
monkeys,[225] possessed of the splendour of a mountain-peak, sprang upon
him and tore him with their teeth. And those foremost of monkeys
attacked the long-armed Kumbhakarna with their claws and teeth and blows
and arms. And then with thousands of monkeys on him that extraordinary
one that fearful Rakshasa--resembling a hill,--looked like a mountain
with trees on it. And like Garuda eating up serpents, that wondrous
strong one, wrought up with rage, devoured those monkeys, seizing them
with his arms. And cast by Kumbhakarna into his mouth resembling the
nether regions the monkeys emerged from his nose and ears. And eating up
the monkeys, that foremost of Rakshasas resembling a hill, growing
wroth, and fired with rage,[226] began to break the monkeys down.--And
transported with passion, that Rakshasa, making the earth miry with
flesh and blood, spread among the monkey-ranks like unto the fire at the
a time of the Universal dissolution. And in that encounter, Kumbhakarna
armed with his dart in his hand, resembled the thunder-handed Sakra, or
the noose-handed Destroyer himself. And as a conflagration[227] burneth
up a withered forest in the summer, Kumbhakarna burnt that host of the
monkeys. And thus beaten (by Kumbhakarna), those monkeys, with their
ranks destroyed, the monkeys,[228] racked with anxiety, began to cry in
unnatural tones. And having innumerable monkeys slain by Kumbhakarna,
the monkeys, aggrieved and their hearts riven with sorrow, sought the
shelter of Raghava. Seeing the monkeys broken in the terrific encounter,
the son of the thunder-handed,[229] darted impetuously against
Kumbhakarna. And taking up a mighty crag, he momentarily setting up
roars, and thereby terrorizing all the Rakshasas--followers of
Kumbhakarna, he discharged the mountain-peak right against Kumbhakarna's
crown.--And struck with that mountain-peak, Indra's
enemy--Kumbhakarna--flamed up in fierce wrath. And the loud-throated
Kumbhakarna, terrifying all the monkeys vehemently darted against the
enraged son of Vali; and then that wondrous strong one hurled his dart
at Angada. And as the dart descended, that foremost of monkeys endowed
with strength,[230] and skilled in battle, evaded the weapon from his
fleetness. And then swiftly springing up, he slapped (his antagonist) in
the chest. And thereat that one resembling a hill, lost his senses. And
recovering his senses, that exceedingly strong Rakshasa, dealt a blow at
Angada; and the latter dropped down senseless. And on that powerful
monkey falling down insensible, Kumbhakarna, taking his dart, rushed
against Sugriva. And seeing the exceeding stout Kumbhakarna approach,
the heroic king of monkeys--Sugriva--sprang up; and taking a
mountain-top that one possessed of great strength darted against the
mighty Kumbhakarna. And seeing that monkey, Kumbhakarna, stretching his
limbs, stood before the lord of monkeys. And seeing Kumbhakarna, with
his body laved in the blood of monkeys; and eating up mighty monkeys,
Sugriva addressed him, saying,--"Thou hast felled heroes done deeds
difficult of being performed, and hast devoured the warriors; and thou
hast thus attained renown. But let go now the monkey-army. What shalt
thou do with the ignoble? Do thou, O Rakshasa bear the descent of this
mountain". Hearing those words of the monkey-king instinct with strength
and fortitude, that terrible Rakshasa--Kumbhakarna--said,--"O monkey,
thou stormest, because thou art the grandson of Prajapati[231] and the
son of the king of bears; and because as such thou art endowed with
fortitude and prowess". Hearing Kumbhakarna's speech, Sugriva whirling
that mountain-peak, suddenly let it go; and with that rock resembling
_Vajra_ or the thunder-bolt, smote Kumbhakarna in the chest. And on
coming in contact with his wide breast, that mountain-peak was at once
shattered in shivers. And thereat the monkeys grew dispirited and the
Rakshasa's ranks shouted in joy. And struck with the mountain-summit,
Kumbhakarna was fired with wrath; and roared, expending his face. And
then, whirling his dart resembling lightning displayed, he hurled it for
compassing the destruction of the master of monkeys. Then swiftly
bounding up, the Wind-god's son, resisting that whetted dart fastened
with golden chains,--with his hands violently snapped it in twain. And
placing the same on his thighs, (Hanuman) snapped that ponderous and
terrible dart composed of black iron, and thereat the monkeys waxed
delighted. And seeing the dart severed by Hanuman, the monkey-army,
growing delighted, set up countless shouts and rushed in all directions.
And the Rakshasa was seized with fear and turned away (from the field.)
And the monkeys excessively delighted, set up loud shouts, and finding
the dart broken, poured forth thanks to the Wind-god's son. Then the
mighty-minded lord of Rakshasas seeing the dart thus severed, uprooted a
peak from the Malaya and with it smote Sugriva. The king of monkeys
struck with the mountain-peak fell senseless upon the field, and the
demons finding him in this plight shouted out in great joy. Then
Kumbhakarna coming to the wonderfully mighty master of monkeys, took him
up and stole away from the field, as a violent gust of wind stealeth
away a patch of cloud. Kumbhakarna, who resembled a mountain in
loftiness of stature, while taking him away like a mass of cloud
appeared like Sumeru overtopped with lofty peaks. Thus the lord of
Rakshasas went on hearing thanks (from the Rakshasas) and shouts from
the lords of the heavens, wondered at the capture of the foremost of
monkeys. Thus taking him captive, that mighty one resembling Indra in
puissance, thought his death would destroy the entire host of the
opponents together with Raghava. Then Hanuman, the shrewd son of Maruta,
finding the whole host of monkeys scattered in all directions, as well
as Sugriva captured by Kumbhakarna bethought himself--"What ought to be
done by me now that our king has been captured? I will doubtless do as
befits me now--let me assume the shape of a mountain and kill the
Rakshasas. Let me kill the mighty Kumbhakarna, splitting his body with
my strong fist and thus relieve the master of monkeys--thus let the
whole host of monkeys become delighted. Or, even when captured by the
whole host of gods or Asuras or serpents he is mighty enough to
extricate himself. Meseems, the lord of monkeys struck with dart in
battle by Kumbhakarna has not yet recovered his senses. Else in a moment
he would do the needful for himself as well as the monkeys. Should the
relief of the mighty-minded Sugriva come from me, I should be incurring
his displeasure and it would certainly lead to the loss of his
reputation for ever; then I must wait a moment and see his own might
displayed by himself when relieved. Meanwhile let me cheer up the
monkey-host". Thinking thus within himself, Hanuman, that son of Maruta,
began to stay the mighty host of monkeys. In the meantime Kumbhakarna
entered Lanka with Sugrira trembling, being honored with the showering
of beautiful flowers from the sky, the buildings on the main roads and
the town-gate. Then the mighty one (Sugriva) slowly recovered his senses
with the shower of fried paddy and sweet scent and the sprinkling of
water as well as with the coolness of the streets. Then that
mighty-minded (Sugriva), caught in the arms of the powerful Rakshasa,
having with difficulty come to his senses and surveying around him the
streets of the town bethought himself:--"When thus within the grasp of
the enemy how can I take revenge? Or let me do what will be acceptable
and advantageous to our army". Then advancing all on a sudden, he with
his nails and sharp teeth cut off the ears and nose of that lord of the
enemies of the gods and split both his sides with the blow of his feet.
And Kumbhakarna losing his ears and nose and having his sides split with
nails and teeth grew angry, and becoming all covered over with blood,
threw Sugriva to the ground and pressed him. Thus pressed upon the
ground with main force and severely struck by the enemies of gods, he
flew to the skies like a ball-rolling, and once more joined Rama. The
mighty Kumbhakarna having lost his nose and ears and drenched in blood,
appeared like a mountain covered all over with streamlets. That
huge-bodied Rakshasa, younger brother of Ravana, terrible in appearance,
resembling a mass of deep black collyrium, and covered all over with
blood, appeared like an evening cloud; and (once more) made up his mind
to appear in battle. Sugriva having thus escaped, that dreadful enemy of
the king of the celestials in wrath again rushed to battle; and finding
himself destitute of arms took up a fearful mace. And then that
mighty-minded one, the Raksha Kumbhakarna, issuing out of the city began
to devour the terrific host of monkeys, as doth the mighty fire eat up
people at the end of a Yuga. On entering the mighty host of monkeys, the
hungry Kumbhakarna, hankering after flesh and blood, ate up the monkeys,
and with them, devoured many a Rakshasa and Pisacha by mistake. Thus, as
Death devoureth creatures at the end of a Yuga, he destroyed the mighty
monkeys. And he in wrath, taking up with one hand the monkeys along with
the Rakshasas, hurriedly threw them into his mouth,--one, two three, or
many at a time. And blood and fat flowed copiously down his body; and
though struck by the monkeys with peaks of mountains, the mighty one
devoured all those monkeys. And the monkeys as they were being devoured,
saught the shelter of Rama. And Kumbhakarna wrought up with wrath,
chased amain hundreds of monkeys, eating up seven, eight, twenty, or
thirty. And fastening (the monkeys) with his arms, he, devouring them,
rushed on. And resembling the Destroyer of prodigious dimensions at the
end of a Yuga, that one furnished with extremely sharp teeth, having his
body covered with fat, marrow and blood, and coiling entrails about his
ears, began to discharge darts. And at this moment, that subduer of
hostile hosts and captor of the capitals of foes--Sumitra's
son--Lakshmana, growing enraged, entered on an encounter with the enemy.
And Lakshmana endued with prowess shot seven shafts at Kumbhakarna's
body; and next, taking up other arrows also discharged them (at his
antagonist). And thereat that Rakshasa, smarting under the wounds
inflicted by that weapon,[232] cut it off (by means of a weapon).
Thereupon grew enraged the powerful Lakshmana--enhancer of Sumitra's
joy. And then as the wind overspreadeth evening clouds, he with his
shafts covered his[233] shining and graceful mail entirely made of gold.
And smit with arrows dight with gold, that one resembling a mass of
dark-blue collyrium appeared beautiful like the ray-furnished Sun
surrounded by clouds. Then that dreadful Rakshasa voiced like masses of
clouds, scornfully addressed the enhancer of Sumitra's felicity,
saying,--"By dauntlessly fighting with me, who have without ado brought
down the Destroyer himself in battle, thou hast established thy heroism.
Even by staying before me, who am equipped with arms in this encounter,
and who in mighty conflict resemble Death himself, thou deservest to be
honored. What shall I say of thy fighting? Not even that lord--Sakra
himself--mounted on his Airavata, and engirt by all the immortals,--had
ever before stayed before me in the field. But to-day, O Sumitra's son,
albeit a boy, thou hast gratified me with thy prowess. Now taking thy
leave, I wish to go to Raghava. And as I have been well pleased in
battle with thy vigour and strength and enthusiasm, I now wish to slay
Rama alone, who being slain, all are slain. On Rama being here slain by
me, the rest remaining in the encounter--them shall I undertake with my
all-crushing vigour". When that Raksha had spoken thus, (Lakshmana);
Sumitra's son, present in that contest, answered him laughing in
terrible words, saying,--"That thy prowess is incapable of being borne
by Sakra and other celestials,--is true. It is not otherwise, O hero.
To-day I myself have witnessed thy prowess. Yonder is Dacaratha's
son--Rama--staying like a moveless mountain". Hearing this, that
night-ranger--Kumhhakarna--possessed of immense might, disregarding
Lakshmana and passing beyond Sumitra's son, rushed against Rama, making
the earth tremble. Thereat Dacaratha's son, Rama, employing a terrific
weapon, discharged sharpened shafts at Kumbhakarna's breast. Thereat
flames mixed with live embers shot out from the mouth of that enraged
one suddenly rushing (against Rama),--as Rama pierced him (with his
arrows). And on being frightfully pierced by Rama's weapons, that
foremost of Rakshasas, roaring wrathfully darted against Rama, and
pursued the monkeys in the conflict. And those shafts adorned with
peacock's plumes, alighting on (Kumbhakarna's) chest, his mace, escaping
his hand, dropped to the earth; and all his (other) arms also were
scattered on the ground. And when that exceedingly powerful one saw
himself deprived of all his arms, he began to spread a huge havoc by
means of his clenched fists and hands. And with his body entirely
covered with arrows and bathed in blood, he began to bleed like a hill
overflowing with fountains. And fired with wrath and maddened with
blood,[234] he rusheth on, devouring monkeys and Rakshasas and bears.
And that redoubtable one possessed of dreadful prowess, resembling the
Reaper himself, whirling a mighty mountain-peak, hurled it aiming at
Rama. Thereat Bharata's elder brother, the righteous Rama, ere that
prodigious peak had alighted, severed the same by means of seven
straight-speeding shafts wrought with gold. Intent on finishing
Kumbhakarna, the virtuous Lakshmana, revolving many a means, (at last)
spoke unto Rama,--"O king, this one knoweth not monkeys and
Rakshasas,--maddened with the smell of blood, he eateth up his own as
well as his enemies. Now let the foremost monkeys, putting forth their
best, mount on him; and let the leaders of bands according to their
rank, stand surrounding him. And then to-day this wicked-minded
Rakshasa, oppressed with a mighty weight, will no longer be able to eat
up any more monkeys". Hearing the words of the intelligent prince, those
exceedingly powerful monkeys with alacrity ascended Kumbhakarna. And
Kumbhakarna mounted by those monkeys, waxing exceedingly enraged, shook
them vehemently, even as mad elephants shake the drivers thereof. And
Raghava seeing them shaken, and concluding the Rakshasa to be wroth,
furiously sprang forward, taking his bow. And with his eyes crimsoned
with choler, the gentle Raghava, as if burning up the Rakshasa with his
eyes, rushed forth vehemently, summoning up all his impetuosity, thereby
cheering up the leaders of bands that had been sore tried by the might
of Kumbhakarna. And equipped with an excellent quiver and arrows, Rama
cheering up the monkeys sprang forward, taking a bow, resembling a
serpent; terrific; having a stout string; and embellished in gold. Then
surrounded by exceedingly invincible monkey-bands, that highly powerful
hero, followed by Lakshmana, marched forth. And he saw the redoubtable
and high-souled Kumbhakarna, with his body drenched in blood, and with
blood-shot eyes; rushing against all, like unto an infuriated elephant
of the cardinal points; pursuing the monkeys; wrought up with wrath;
environed by Rakshasas; appearing like the Vindhya or the Mandara;
decked with golden _angadas_; bleeding from his mouth; like clouds
pouring showers; licking at the corners of his mouth laved with blood;
smashing the monkey-ranks; and resembling Yama the Destroyer. And that
best of persons, seeing that foremost of Rakshasas having the splendour
of a living fire, stretched his bow to its full bent. And fired with
wrath at the twang of his bow, that foremost of Rakshasas, inflamed with
wrath,--not brooking that report, rushed against Raghava. Thereat, the
gentle Rama, endowed with arms resembling the body of the sovereign of
serpents, in that encounter addressed Kumbhakarna, like unto an elevated
cloud and possessed of the splendour of a mountain,--as he darted
forward, saying,--"Come, O king of Rakshas! Let no grief be thine! Here
I stay, taking my bow in my hand. Know me for the destroyer of the race
of the Rakshasas--thou who in a moment shalt be deprived of thy senses".
Knowing that this was Rama, (Kumbhakarna) laughed in frightful accents;
and then, wrought up with wrath, rushed against the monkeys in the
encounter. And as if riving the breasts of all the monkeys (present),
the exceedingly energetic Kumbhakarna, laughing frightfully and in a
terrific manner,--resembling the rumbling of clouds, addressed Raghava,
saying,--"Take me not for Viradha, or for Kavandha, or yet for Khara. I
am not Vali or Maricha. I am Kumbhakarna, that am come. Behold my
dreadful and mighty mace entirely made of iron. By help of this I had
formerly brought down deities and Danavas. It doth not behove thee to
scorn me in that my nose hath been severed. I do not feel any the
smallest torment in consequence of my ears and nose having been cut off.
O tiger of the Ikshwaku line, O sinless one, do thou witness the prowess
that is in my frame. And thereafter, when thou shalt have displayed thy
prowess and power, shall I devour thee up". Hearing Kumbhakarna's words,
Rama discharged (at him) shafts furnished with knobs. And smit with
these having the impetus of the thunder-bolt, the foe of the celestials
did not feel any pain or smart. And those shafts which had severed the
seven stately _salas_, and, to boot, had slain Vali--best of
monkeys,--they resembling the thunder itself--could not impart any pain
to Kumbhakarna's body. And drinking up in his body those arrows
resembling a shower, the enemy of the great Indra whirling his mace
possessed of fierce vehemence, put out the arrowy discharge of Rama.
Then that Raksha whirling his mace washed in blood, capable of striking
terror into the mighty hosts of gods and Danavas, and possessed of
fierce impetus,--made the monkey-army take to its heels. Then Rama,
taking a mighty _Vayavya_ weapon, used the same against the
night-ranger; and cut off his arm with the mace. And having his arm cut
off, he set up tremendous roars. And his arm with the mace, resembling a
mountain-peak, cut off by Raghava's arrows, fell in the midst of the
army of the monkey-king, and destroyed that army.[235] Thereat the
monkeys remaining after those broken and slain,--dispirited, and having
their limbs wounded,--moving aside, looked on the dreadful encounter
between the Raksha and the lord of men. And then Kumbhakarna, having his
arm severed, resembling the foremost of mountains with its crest hewn
away by a mighty sabre, tore up a tree with his (remaining) arm and in
the conflict rushed against the monarch of men. Thereupon with a shaft
plated in gold, set upon a weapon of Indra, Rama cut off his uplifted
arm with a palm tree, looking like the body of a _pannaga_. And that arm
of Kumbhakarna, being severed, dropped inert on the earth, like a hill,
and crushed trees and rocks and crags and monkeys and Rakshasas. And
Rama, seeing that one shorn of his arms suddenly spring up,
roaring,--took up two whetted crescents, and in the contest cut off the
legs of the Rakshasa. And thereupon those legs (of his), making all
sides and quarters and rocks and caves and the mighty main and Lanka
herself and the army of the monkeys and the
Rakshasas,--resound,--dropped down (on the ground). And having his arms
cut off and his legs also severed, (Kumbhakarna), opening wide his mouth
resembling in sheen the mouth of a mare, roaring swiftly darted against
Raghava,--even as Rahu pursueth the Moon in the firmament. Then Rama
stuffed his mouth full of sharpened shafts having their feathered parts
furnished with gold. And having his mouth filled; he could not
articulate; but with extreme effort uttered indistinct accents and
swooned away. Then Rama took an arrow of Indra,--whetted and knobbed,
impetuous as the wind, resembling the effulgence of the Sun, and like
unto the very banner of Brahma, or the Destroyer himself; and fatal to
foes. And then Rama hurled it at the ranger of the night. And thereat
that weapon hurled by Rama's arm, resembling a smokeless flame, lighting
up the ten cardinal points with its own glory,--saught him that was
possessed of the dreadful energy of Sakra's thunder-bolt. And therewith
he (Rama) cut off the head of the lord of Rakshas resembling a
mountain-summit, furnished with prominent teeth,--from which the
ear-rings had fallen off,--even as formerly Purandara had cut off the
head of Vritra. And then Kumbhakarna's huge head deprived of the
ear-rings appeared like the Moon seated in the midst (of the heavens) on
the rising of the Sun in the morning.[236] And struck with Rama's arrow,
the head of the Raksha resembling a hill fell down to the earth; and (in
its fall) crushed edifices on the highways and gateways; and elevated
walls also it bore down to the ground. And then that Raksha of gigantic
proportions and vast to the view plunged into the deep; and crushing
huge and mighty fishes and serpents, saught the depths. And on that
enemy of the Brahmanas and gods, endowed with immense strength,--having
been slain in battle, the earth shook and the mountains also; and from
excess of joy the celestials shouted aloud. And those deities and saints
and Maharshis and Pannagas, and celestials and (other) beings and birds
and Guhyakas, together with Yakshas and Gandharvas,--all these who had
stationed themselves in the welkin,--were rejoiced at the prowess of
Rama. And at his (Kumbhakarna's) great destruction, the intelligent
adherents of the king of Nairitas,--aggrieved exceedingly, began to cry
at the sight of that best of the Raghus, even as mad elephants cry at
sight of a lion. And like unto the Sun emerged from the mouth of Rahu,
and destroying the darkness of the celestial fields,--shone Rama in the
midst of the monkey-army having slain Kumbhakarna in battle. And
countless monkeys experienced the very height of delight; and on (their)
foe of terrific strength having been slain, they with countenances
resembling awaked lotuses paid homage unto the king's son--Raghava--the
sharer of good fortune. And as the monarch of the immortals had rejoiced
on slaying the mighty Asura--Vritra--Bharata's elder brother rejoiced on
having in battle slain that smiter of celestial hosts, Kumbhakarna in
mighty conflict, never (before) vanquished in renowned encounters.

SECTION LXVIII.


Seeing Kumbhakarna slain by the high-souled Raghava, the Rakshasas
conveyed the tidings to the lord of the Rakshasas--Ravana; (and
addressed him, saying), "O king, that one resembling the Destroyer
himself, urged on by Death,--having scoured the monkey-army and eaten up
monkeys,--and for a while displayed his prowess, hath met with his
quietus at the hands of Rama exerting his energy. And with half his body
immersed in the dreadful deep, thy brother, Kumbhakarna, with his nose
and ears cut off, and blood besmearing his body,--with his head and
limbs hewn away, and his body uncovered,--mountain-like blocketh up the
gate of Lanka with his person,--and resembleth a tree that hath been
consumed by a forest-fire". Hearing the mighty Kumbhakarna slain in
battle, Ravana burning in grief, swooned away and dropped to the earth.
And hearing their uncle slain, Triciras[237] and Atikaya--destroyers of
gods and men,--began to weep, oppressed with sorrow. And Mahodara[238]
and Mahaparcwa[239] hearing of their uncle slain by Rama of untiring
deeds, were overcome with grief. Then regaining his senses with extreme
exertion, that foremost of Rakshasas, distressed in consequence of the
destruction of Kumbhakarna, mourned with his senses overwhelmed,
saying,--"O hero! O humbler of the pride of the foe! O mighty
Kumbhakarna! Leaving me, thou through Destiny, hast gone to the abode of
Yama. O exceedingly powerful one, leaving me (lone) whither dost thou
wend, without extracting my dart as well as that of thy friends? Now
really I am not, inasmuch as my right arm hath dropped. Backed by this
one, I would not fear celestials and Asuras. How to-day forsooth hath
such a hero--crusher of the hauteur of gods and Danavas--resembling the
Fire arisen at the hour of universal wreck,--been slain in fight by
Raghava? He who could not be harmed by the concussion of the
thunder-bolt itself--how can he, smitten with Rama's arrows, sleep
soundly on the earth? These gods stationed in the sky along with the
saints,--beholding thee slain in battle, are shouting in glee. Surely
to-day the monkeys overjoyed,--finding occasion, will scale all the
gateways and fortifications of Lanka. I have nothing to do with empire.
And what shall I do with Sita? And deprived of Kumbhakarna, I do not
even wish to live. If I do not slay in encounter that slayer of my
brother--Raghava,--certainly death is even that which is good for
me,--otherwise, this life is useless. This very day will I repair to
that place where my younger brother is. Forsaking my brother, I forsooth
dare not live for a moment; for the gods shall laugh on seeing me, who
had formerly wronged them. But, how, O Kumbhakarna, thou having been
slain, shall I conquer Indra? Now the beneficial words of Bibhishana
have been verified. And as through blindness I did not accept the advice
of that high-souled one, Kumbhakarna and of Prahasta, this disaster
arisen, shameth me sore. And as I had disgraced the virtuous and
graceful Bibhishana, this peril producing grief, hath been the
consequence of my conduct". Having thus piteously and long lamented
Kumbhakarna, the Ten-necked one, with his inmost soul overwhelmed with
sorrow, and sore distressed in consequence of grief,--fell down, knowing
his brother--the enemy of Indra--slain in battle.

SECTION LXIX.


Hearing the lamentations of the wicked-minded Ravana, overwhelmed with
grief, Triciras addressed him, saying,--"O Sire, this second uncle unto
us possessed of mighty prowess hath[240] forsooth been slain in fight.
But, O king, heroes never indulge in grief as thou doest O lord, thou
certainly alone art competent to conquer the triple world. Wherefore
then dost thou vent such sorrow like an ignoble one? Thou hast thy dart
conferred on thee by Brahma; and thy mail and thy weapon--the bow--and
thy car yoked with a thousand asses, sending forth clatter resembling
the rumbling of clouds. The deities and the Danavas have by means of thy
arms been terrified over and over again. And furnished with all arms,
thou ought to chastise Raghava. But stay at thy pleasure, O mighty
sovereign, I will go out to battle; and even as Garuda captureth
serpents, will I capture thine enemies. And as Samvara was vanquished by
the lord of the immortals, or Naraka by Vishnu, will I bringing down
Rama in battle make him sleep (in the field)". Hearing Triciras' words,
Ravana--lord of Rakshasas--urged on by Fate, considered himself as
having regained his life. And hearing the speech of Triciras, Devantaka,
and Narantaka, and the energetic Atikaya also, were wrought up with
martial enthusiasm. And then those foremost of Nairitas--the heroic sons
of Ravana--endowed with the prowess of Sakra himself--roared out, 'I
will go,' 'I will go.' And all could range the sky, and all were skilled
in illusion, and all were crushers of the pride of the immortals; and
all were irrisistible in encounter. And all of them were endowed with
superior strength, and all had achieved wide celebrity. They had never
been heard of as having been beaten in fight even by the gods along with
the Gandharvas, or the mighty serpents accompanied by the Kinnaras. And
all were skilled in weapons and heroic; and all were versed in warfare.
And all were possessed of the higher knowledge; and all had obtained
boons. And then the king surrounded by those sons of his, appearing like
celestials,--capable of injuring the force and fortune of the
foe,--looked splendid like Maghavan environed by the immortals, humblers
of the hauteur of mighty Danavas. And embracing his sons and adorning
them in ornaments,--he sent them to the field with his best
benedictions. And Ravana sent the brothers--Yudhyonmatta and Matta--for
protecting the princes in the field. And then, saluting the high-souled
Ravana--destroyer of creatures,--and going round him, those huge-bodied
ones marched forth. And furnished with every description of medicinal
herbs and perfumes, these six Nairitas--foremost of their kind--endowed
with great strength--burning for battle, marched forth,--Triciras and
Atikaya, and Devantaka and Narantaka, and Mahodara and Mahaparcwa went
out, urged on by Fate. Then Mahodara mounted the
elephant--Sudarcana--sprung in the race of Airavata, and resembling
dark-blue clouds. And accoutred in every weapon, and decked with
quivers, he looked splendid on his elephant like the Sun ascending the
crest of the Setting-hill. And Ravana's son--Triciras--ascended a car
yoked with excellent steeds, and furnished with every variety of arms.
And having ascended the car, Triciras bow in hand appeared beautiful
like a mass of burning clouds having lightning and meteors, and crowned
with Indra's bow.[241] And dight with three diadems, Triciras looked
splendid in that superb car, like the monarch of mountains Himavan--with
the three golden hills. And then that foremost of all bowmen--the
powerful Atikaya--son unto the lord of Rakshasas--ascended the best of
cars having excellent wheels and _akshas_, and yoked with excellent
steeds,--and furnished with bottoms and holes; flaming with quivers and
bows; and bristling with _pracas_ and swords and blugdeons. And adorned
with a crown plated with wrought gold and (other) ornaments, he looked
like the Meru swimming in its own splendour And that powerful son of the
king surrounded by the Nairitas looked lovely on that car like the
thunder-handed (Deity) engirt by the immortals. And Narantaka mounted a
white steed resembling Uchchaicrava, caparisoned in gold, having a large
frame and endowed with the velocity of the Wind. And taking a _praca_,
Narantaka appeared like the energetic Guha mounted on the peacock,
grasping his dart. And taking a bludgeon decked in golden ornaments,
Devantaka resembled Vishnu at the time of the churning of the ocean,
holding the Darbhya,[242] and staying burthening (the earth). And the
powerful Mahaparcwa endowed with terrific energy, taking his mace,
appeared like Kuvera holding in his hand a mace in the encounter. And
like immortals issuing out of Amaravati, they marched out with elephants
and steeds and cars sending out clatter resembling the rumbling of
clouds. And them followed high-souled Rakshasas equipped with
mighty-arms. And those sun-bright high-souled princes decked with
diadems appeared splendid like burning planets in the firmament. And the
various gorgeous attires which they had worn resembled rows of cranes in
the sky, looking like autumnal clouds. Resolved on dying or conquering
the foe in fight, those heroes sallied out seeking encounter. And those
high-souled ones, incapable of being repressed in fight, roared and
shouted and discharged shafts and held them. And the earth shook as they
sent up leonine roars and struck at their arms with their hands; and the
sky seemed riven with the leonine roars of the Rakshas. And issuing out
cheerfully, those foremost of Rakshasas endowed with great strength
beheld that monkey-army staying with upraised rocks and stones. And the
high souled monkeys also saw that mighty host of Rakshasas thronging
with elephants, horses and cars, and ringing with hundreds of bell-lets;
resembling dark-blue clouds; upraising mighty arms; and environed on all
sides by Nairitas resembling flaming fire. And seeing that force
advance, the monkeys, finding opportunity, upraising giant crags,
momentarily set up shouts. And thereat, the Rakshasas, incapable of
bearing those shouts, shouted in reply unto the monkeys. And again the
monkeys shouted unto the Rakshas, who were unable to put up with that
cry. And hearing that loud shout of the monkey-leaders, the mighty
Rakshas incapable of bearing that noise expressive of
exhilaration,--shouted still more dreadfully. And then diving into that
dreadful Rakshasa army, the monkey leaders began to range it with
uplifted rocks,--like unto mountains. And equipped with trees and
stones, the monkeys enraged, ranged the Raksha army, now rising into the
sky. and now coming down to the earth. And some among the powerful
monkeys went about taking broad-shouldered trees. And the encounter that
took place between the thronging Rakshas and monkeys was something
terrific. And (the monkeys) began to pour a wonderful shower of trees
and rocks and cliffs. And the monkeys of dread prowess were resisted
with vollies of shafts. And in the contest the monkeys and Rakshasas
emitted leonine roars. And monkeys crushed Yatudhanas with rocks, and,
wrought with rage, (they) in the encounter slew (Rakshasas) covered with
armour and ornaments; and some slew heroes mounted on cars and elephants
and steeds. And the monkeys on a sudden slew heroic Yatudhanas. And smit
with mountain-peaks on their persons, and with their eyes falling off,
the foremost of Rakshasas moved, dropped down, or roared in the scene of
conflict. And the Rakshasas (on their part) pierced the foremost of
monkeys with sharpened and keen darts and clubs and scimitars; and slew
them with darts and _pracas_. And, eager for bringing down each other,
the monkeys and the Rakshasas with their persons, washed with the blood
of their antagonists felled each other. And in a moment the earth was
covered with crags and swords discharged by monkeys and Rakshasas,--and
was drenched in gore. And the field was blocked up with scattered
mountain-like Rakshas influenced by martial ardour,--mangled by their
enemies. And the monkeys thrown down and felled by means of broken crags
and monkeys[243] and arms and legs,--waged a wonderful war. And those
foremost of Nairitas slew monkeys with (the dead bodies of monkeys); and
the monkeys smote Rakshasas with (the dead bodies of) Rakshasas; and the
Rakshasas slew (the monkeys), hurling rocks and crags. And snatching
away their own arms by main force, the monkeys finished Rakshas; and
they slaughtered them with mountain-peaks, and also wounded each other.
And the monkeys and Rakshasas emitted leonine roars in the encounter.
And the Rakshasas, slain by the monkeys, having their mail and defence
for the body rent, bled like unto trees exuding sap. And in that
encounter, some among the monkeys destroyed cars with cars, elephants
with elephants, and steeds with steeds. And the Rakshasas rived the
trees and rocks of the foremost monkeys by means of _Kshurapras_ and
crescents and sharpened _Bhallas_ and arrows. And in that encounter, the
earth became impassable, having been scattered with crags baffled and
severed trees and (warriors) slain by monkeys and Rakshas. And those
monkeys, equipped with various weapons, and with their vigor unworn,
entering upon the conflict casting off fear,--cheerfully putting forth
efforts springing from pride of spirit, warred on with the Rakshasas.
And in that fearful conflict, which was being waged, on the monkeys
having been exhilarated and the Rakshasas having been brought down, the
Maharshis and the deities sent up shouts. Then mounted on a charger
endued with the celerity of the Wind, and grasping a whetted dart,
Narantaka entered into that fierce army of monkeys, like a fish diving
into the deep. And that hero by means of an effulgent bearded dart
pierced seven hundred monkeys; and at one time the high-souled enemy of
Indra slew the army of the foremost of monkeys. And the Vidyadharas and
Maharshis saw that high-souled one mounted on horseback, ranging the
monkey-ranks. And his course was discovered, miry with flesh and blood
and blocked up with mountain-like monkeys fallen. And when the monkeys
set their hearts on displaying their prowess, Narantaka, baffling them,
pierced them with shafts. And he consumed the monkey-army, like fire
burning a forest. And when the wood-rangers uprooted trees and crags,
they slain by bearded darts dropped down like mountains riven by the
thunder. And raising a glowing _praca_, the powerful Narantaka began to
range about in the rear[244] of the forces; dashing everywhere (against
the foe) in fight, like the wind in the rainy season. And the heroes
could not appear prominently, or keep their posts. And how could they
then move freely? And that one endued with prowess pierced everyone,
whether springing, or staying, or moving. And broken through by a single
_praca_, resembling the Reaper, and furnished with solar effulgence, the
monkey-ranks began to roll on the earth. And the monkeys were ill fitted
to bear the impetus of that _praca_ having the touch of thunder itself;
and they raised a loud cry. And the appearances of those monkey-heroes
falling were like mountains toppling, having their summits riven with
the thunder-bolt. Those high-souled and powerful monkeys that formerly
had been brought down by Kumbhakarna,--having recovered, were present
with Sugriva in this encounter. And Sugriva, looking around, saw that
monkey-army flying in all directions, agitated with the fear of
Narantaka. And after seeing the army in flight, he saw Narantaka
himself, advancing, wielding a _praca_, and mounted on a steed. And as
soon as he saw (that hero), the exceedingly energetic lord of
monkeys--Sugriva--addressed the heroic prince Angada, endowed with
strength equal to that of Indra, saying,--"Go against this heroic
Rakshasas that is mounted on a steed; and speedily deprive of life that
one who is devouring up the ranks of his foes". Hearing his master's
speech, Angada descended from that host resembling clouds, like the
powerful Sun himself. And resembling a mass of crags, Angada--foremost
of monkeys--adorned with _Angadas_, appeared beautiful like a mountain
with metals on it. And weaponless himself, and furnished only with nails
and teeth, Vali's son attacking Narantaka, said,--"Stay! What shalt thou
do with these interior monkeys? This _praca_, having the feel of the
thunder-bolt, do thou hurl at my heart itself". Hearing Angada's words,
Narantaka was fired with wrath. And knawing his upper lip with his teeth
and sighing like a serpent, Narantaka, wrought with wrath, approached
Vali's son. And then whirling his _praca_, he suddenly discharged that
flaming (weapon) against Angada. And then it was snapped on the breast
of Vali's son, resembling the thunder-bolt, and dropped to the earth.
And seeing the _praca_ broken in pieces, like a powerful snake severed
by Suparna, Vali's son, raising his hand, dealt a slap at the head of
his (Narantaka's) steed. Thereat, with his legs sinking down and his
eye-balls coming off and his tongue hanging down, and wearing the look
of a mountain,--on being smit with that slap, Narantaka's steed fell
down to the ground, with its head lying at random. And Narantaka seeing
his charger slain and fallen, was seized with a furious wrath, and
raising his clenched fist, that one endowed with exceeding great energy
in that conflict hit Vali's son on the head. Thereat Angada having his
head wounded by that blow, warm blood gushed out plentifully. And
momentarily burning and momentarily swooning, he, regaining his senses,
was amazed. Then Vali's son, the high-souled Angada clenching his fist
into a blow resembling Death itself in energy, and like unto a
mountain-peak, let it descend on the chest of Narantaka. Thereat, with
his breast riven and broken down, vomitting flames and having his body
bathed in blood, Narantaka dropped down to the earth, like a hill
shattered by the impetus of the thunder-bolt. And on Narantaka of
exceeding prowess having been slain by Vali's son in battle, there arose
a tremendous uproar in the firmament from the wood-rangers and the
foremost of celestials. And Angada having performed that difficult deed
of prowess, capable of delighting the mind of Rama, was seized with
amazement;[245] and that one of terrific feats in fight was again
inspired with delight in the encounter.

And seeing Narantaka slain, the foremost of Nairitas--including the
three-headed Devantaka and Pulastya's descendant, Mahodara,--began to
cry (in chorus). And then the vehement Mahodara, mounted (on horseback),
rushed against Vali's son endued with energy. And aggrieved in
consequence of the calamity that had befallen his brother, the strong
Devantaka grasping a dreadful bludgeon, darted against Angada. And
ascending a car resembling the Sun yoked with superb steeds, the heroic
Triciras rushed against Vali's son. Then charged by those three powerful
Rakshasas--crushers of the hauteur of immortals, Angada uprooted a tree
furnished with gigantic branches. And as Sakra hurleth the mighty
flaming thunderbolt, that hero--Angada--at once hurled against Devantaka
that mighty tree having giant branches. And Triciras cut off that tree
in pieces by means of shafts resembling serpents. And seeing the tree
severed, Angada darted up; and[246] then that foremost of monkeys
showered crags and trees. And all those Triciras wrought with wrath cut
off by means of whetted arrows; and Mahodara snapped those trees with
the end of his bludgeon. And then Triciras rushed against that
hero--Vali's son--with shafts; and Mahodara chased him,[247] mounted on
an elephant; and struck Angada in the chest with _tomaras_ resembling
the thunder-bolt. And Devantaka, enraged advancing, hit Angada with his
bludgeon, and then, endowed with velocity, he swiftly turned away. And
attacked simultaneonly by those three powerful Nairitas, the exceedingly
energetic son of Vali possessed of prowess, did not feel any pain. And
that impetuous one incapable of being conquered, summoning his utmost
vehemence, rushing on, pealt a slap at his[248] mighty elephant. And
thereat the elephant fell down in his very sight and expired. And then
pulling out his tusks, the highly powerful son of Vali, darting against
Devantaka, dealt him a blow therewith in that encounter. And thereupon
that strong one overwhelmed like a tree buffetted by the wind, began to
discharge blood profusely, looking like the hue of lac. And then
cheering him, the exceedingly energetic and powerful Narantaka,
violently whirling his bludgeon with might and main, hit Angada with it.
And albeit struck with the bludgeon, the son of the lord of monkeys,
going down on his knees, again darted up. And as he sprang up, Triciras
hit at the temples of the son of the king of monkeys with three
straight-speeding terrific shafts. And seeing Angada assailed by the
three redoubtable Rakshasas, Hanuman and Nila proceeded (to his rescue).
Then Nila hurled a mountain-top at Triciras; and thereat that son of
Ravana severed it with sharpened arrows. And that mountain-top on being
riven, dropped down, aflame and shooting out sparks of fire. And seeing
him[249] yawning in joy, the stalwart Devantaka in that encounter
pursued the Wind-god's son with his bludgeon. And as he rushed on, that
foremost of monkeys--Hanuman--dealt on the crown of his head, a blow
resembling the thunder-bolt itself. And the mighty and heroic son of the
Wind-god hit (at his antagonist); and that redoubted monkey also with
his roars made the Rakshasas tremble (in fear). And thereat with his
head crushed and cleft, and his teeth and eyes falling out, and his
tongue hanging down, that son unto the sovereign of the Rakshasas
suddenly dropped to the earth, deprived of life. On that fierce and
mighty Rakshasa warrior--that foe of the immortals--having fallen in
fight, the Three-headed one, waxing wondrous enraged began to shower
terrific sharpened shafts on Nila's chest. And Mahodara, getting
enraged, again swiftly mounted an elephant like the ray-furnished (Sun)
mounting Mandara. Then even as a mass of roaring clouds poureth down
showers enwheeled with levin on a mountain, he showered arrows right on
Nila's breast. Thereat showered with those shafts, that leader of
monkeys Nila with his person pierced, had his body riven and was
stupified by that exceedingly powerful one. Then that (monkey) possessed
of tremendous vehemence, having regained his senses, uprooting a crag
with a whole tract of trees, struck it at Mahodara's head. And struck by
that mighty enemy, Mahodara, broken down by the impetus of that rock,
deprived of his senses, dropped down dead on the ground, like a cliff
smit with the thunder-bolt.

Seeing his uncle slain, Triciras took up his bow; and inflamed with fury
pierced Hanuman with whetted arrows. And thereat the Wind-god's son,
enraged, hurled a mountain-peak (at his adversary). And Triciras by
means of keen arrows severed the same in shivers. And seeing the
mountain-peak baffled, the monkey in the encounter began to shower trees
on Ravana's son. And Triciras endowed with prowess by means of sharpened
shafts cut off that descending arrowy shower in the sky and shouted (in
delight). Then Hanuman flying into a fury, bounding to the welkin, with
his nails ripped the steed of Triciras, even as a lion cleaveth a
powerful elephant. Then taking a dart even as the Destroyer employeth
the Fatal Night, Ravana's son--Triciras--discharged it at the offspring
of the Wind-god. Thereat catching the dart of resistless course as it
descended from the sky, the powerful monkey snapped it and then shouted.
And seeing that dreadful dart broken by Hanuman, the monkeys,
transported with delight, sent up shouts, even as clouds rumble. Than
upraising his sword, that foremost of Rakshasas--Triciras--brought it
down on the breast of the monkey-chief. Overpowered with the sword-blow,
Hanuman--son unto the Wind-god,--endowed with energy, dealt the
Three-headed one a slap on the head. And smitten with that slap, the
highly powerful Triciras, with his hands and attire dropping off, fell
down to the earth, deprived of consciousness. Then that mighty monkey
resembling a hill broke his sword as he fell, and roared, terrifying all
the Rakshasas. But not brooking that uproar, that night-ranger sprang
up; and springing up, he dealt a blow at Hanuman. And at that blow, the
redoubtable monkey was wrought up with wrath; and inflamed with rage, he
smote that foremost of Rakshasas about his diadem. And then with a sharp
sword the Wind-god's son cut off his heads decked with diadems and
furnished with ear-rings; even as Sakra had severed the heads of
Tashtri's son.[250] Thereat even as burning stars, loosened, drop down
from the course of Indra, the large organs of sense, and eyes flaming
like glowing fire, and heads of that foe of Indra, dropped down to the
ground. On Triciras--enemy of the immortals--having been slain by
Hanuman endowed with the prowess itself of Sakra, the monkeys shouted,
the earth shook, and the Rakshas began to fly on all sides. And seeing
Triciras and Yudhyonmatta slain and seeing also the irrepressible
Devantaka and Narantaka slain (in the encounter), that highly irascible
and powerful Rakshasa--Matta--was transported with passion, and then
took up a flaming mace entirely wrought with iron inlaid with gold;
frothy with flesh and gore; mighty to behold; gratified with the blood
of foes; with its end flaming in splendour; decked with red wreaths; and
capable of striking terror into Airavata and Mahapadma and
Sarvabhauma.[251] And flaming up like the Fire arisen at the end of a
Yuga, that foremost of Rakshasas--Matta--wrought with fury,--rushed
against the monkeys. Then the mighty and powerful
monkey--Rishabha--springing up before Ravana's son, stood before the
hosts of Matta. And seeing that mountain-like monkey staying before
(him), Matta, enraged, dealt him a blow on the breast. And smit with the
mace, that foremost of monkeys, with his breast riven and trembling,
began to bleed copiously. And regaining his senses after a long while,
Rishabha--lord of monkeys--inflamed with wrath, pouting out his upper
lip, gazed at Mahaparcwa.[252] And then impetuously approaching the
Rakshasa, that foremost of heroic monkeys resembling a hill, endowed
with vehemence, clenching his fist, suddenly smote him with a blow on
his breast. Thereat like a tree whose roots have been severed, he
suddenly dropped on the ground, covered with blood. And thereupon,
(Rishabha) swiftly snatched his dreadful mace resembling the rod of Yama
himself; and shouted. Only for a moment did he[253] remain like one
dead. Recovering his senses, the enemy of the immortals, looking like
evening clouds in hue, suddenly springing up, attacked the son of the
king of waters.[254] And thereat, he dropped down to the earth,
senseless. In a moment regaining his consciousness, he again bounded
up,--and whirling the mace resembling a peak of the foremost of
mountains, in that encounter dealt (Matta) a blow therewith. And
descending on the body of that dreadful one--the enemy of deities,
sacrifices and Vipras--that terrific mace rived his breast; and he began
to bleed profusely, even as the lord of mountains discharges minerals
and water. And taking the terrific mace of the high-souled (Matta) and
swinging it again and again, (Rishabha) rushed (against the Rakshasas).
And that high-souled one began to slaughter Matta's forces in the field.
And broken down by his own mace, Matta dropped down like a hill, with
his teeth and eyes shrivelled up; and he dropped to the earth deprived
of strength and life, with his eyes paling. And on that Rakshasa
falling, the Rakshasa forces began to fly. And on that brother of Ravana
having been slain, that host of Nairitas appearing like the ocean in
grandeur, leaving its arms behind,--solely for life rushed away, like
unto the deep riven (by the winds).

SECTION LXXI.


Seeing in sore straits his own mighty forces capable of making people's
down stand on end,--and seeing his brothers resembling Sakra in prowess,
routed; and seeing also his uncles brought down in battle, as well as
his brothers--Yudhyonmatta and Matta--foremost of Rakshasas, that
crusher of the pride of deities and Danavas--the exceedingly energetic
Atikaya--resembling a hill, who had obtained from Brahma a boon in
battle, was fired with wrath. Ascending a car effulgent like a thousand
suns mingling their rays into a burst of brilliance, that enemy of
Sakra, charged the monkeys. And stretching his bow, (Atikaya) decked
with a diadem and wearing polished ear-rings, proclaimed his name (among
the monkey-ranks) and shouted in lofty tones. And with his leonine roars
and the proclamation of his name, and the tremendous twang of his
bow-string, he struck terror into the monkeys. Seeing the magnitude of
his person, the monkeys thinking that it was Kumbhakarna who had
come,--and affrighted thereat, sought the shelter of each other. And
seeing his form like unto that of Vishnu when he displayed his threefold
energy, the monkey-warriors seized with fear, began to scour on all
sides. And on Atikaya appearing before them, the monkeys, stupified in
that conflict, saught the shelter of Lakshmana's elder brother. And from
a distance Kakutstha saw the mountain like Atikaya mounted on the car
and equipped with his bow, like unto roaring clouds (seen) on the
occasion of the universal disruption. And seeing that huge-bodied one,
Raghava struck with surprise, comforting the monkeys, addressed
Bibhishana, saying,--"Who is this one resembling a mountain, furnished
with a bow and having leonine eyes, that is stationed on a large car
yoked with a thousand steeds,--he that with effulgent sharpened darts
and keen _pracas_ and _tomaras_, shineth like Mahecwara environed by
spectres--he that displaying his fatal tongue, appeareth splendid,
surrounded with darts in his car; like a mass of clouds graced with
lightning. And his bows adorned and backed with gold all over, beautify
his car even as Indra's bow beautifyeth the firmament. And who is this
foremost of Rakshasas and best of bowmen that embellishing the field of
battle, approacheth on a car glorious as the sun; who, displaying the
ten cardinal points with his shafts resembling the rays of the sun,
appeareth handsome with his peak of a banner bearing the figure of
Rahu--whose bow bent in three places, emitting roars resembling the
rumbling of clouds, and plated with gold, looketh like the bow itself of
Satakratu? And his mighty car furnished with a banner and ensign and
bottom, and having clatter resembling the roaring of clouds, hath four
horsemen (attached to it). And there are on the car eight and thirty
quivers and dreadful bows and yellow-golden bow-strings. And there are
(in that car) two effulgent swords at his side, illumining it,--their
hafts measuring four hands and their blades ten each. And that calm
(warrior) wears red garlands about his neck, and resembles a mighty
mountain. And a very Destroyer, he hath a mighty mouth, appearing like
that of the Destroyer himself; and he looketh like the sun stationed on
clouds. And with his arms adorned with golden _angadas_, he appeareth
splendid like that best of mountains--the Himavan with its towering
summits. And with his pair of ear-rings, his charming yet terrific
countenance shineth like the full Moon entering into Punarvacu.[255] O
mighty-armed one, tell me all about this foremost of Rakshasas, seeing
whom the monkeys, overwhelmed with fear, fly away in all directions".
Asked by the king's son--Rama of immeasurable prowess--the exceedingly
energetic Bibhishana spoke unto Rama, informing him,--"The highly
powerful king, Vaisravana's younger brother of dreadful deeds, the
high-souled Ravana--is the sovereign of the Rakshasas. This one is his
mighty son, like unto Ravana himself in strength. He serveth the aged,
is of wide celebrity and is the prime of those versed in all branches of
knowledge. And he is competent to ride horses and elephants, to wield
the sword or draw the bow,--or in sowing dissensions, or giving away, or
in counsel,--he reposing in whose arm Lanka hath cast off fear. Know him
to be Atikaya, son unto Dhanyamali. Having adored the pure-souled Brahma
with austerities, he hath obtained weapons, and hath defeated his foes
(in fight)". 'Thou shalt be incapable of being slain by celestials and
Asuras'--was the boon conferred on him by the Self-sprung; and he also
gave him this celestial mail and this car resembling the effulgent Sun
himself. He hath vanquished (in battle) hundreds of deities and Danavas;
and he hath (always) protected the Rakshas, and destroyed Yakshas. And
this intelligent one resisted the thunder-bolt itself of Indra; and in
encounter baffled the very noose of the king of waters. This one is
Atikaya--foremost of Rakshasas; and that son of Ravana is the humbler of
the hauteur of deities and Danavas. Therefore, O best of persons, do
thou endeavour thy best. This one with his shafts slaughtered the
monkey-hosts before (us)". And then the powerful Atikaya entering that
monkey-force, stretched his bow and shouted again and again. And the
high-souled principal monkeys, seeing that (hero) possessed of a
dreadful person, that best of car-warriors--stationed on his car, rushed
forward. And Kumuda and Dwivida and Mainda and Nila and Sabha dashed on
at one time with trees and mountain-peaks. Thereupon that foremost of
those skilled in weapons, the exceedingly energetic Atikaya, severed
those trees and rocks by means of shafts dight with gold. And in that
encounter that powerful one possessed of a gigantic person, skilled in
arms, pierced all those monkeys staying before him with arrows entirely
made of iron. And agonised, having their persons pierced in that mighty
conflict by that arrowy shower, they were incapable of resisting the
same. And the Rakshasa terrified that host of monkey-heroes, even as an
enraged lion priding in his youth terrifyeth a society of deer. And in
the midst of those bands of monkeys, that lord of Rakshasas did not slay
anyone without battle. And then springing up before Rama, that one
furnished with his bow and quiver, addressed him in haughty words,
saying,--"Stationed in this car holding the bow and arrows in my hands,
I will not fight any that is ignoble. Him that hath strength, and that
also understandeth this business,--let him today speedily give me
battle". Hearing his speech, that slayer of foes--Sumitra's son--was
fired with wrath. And not bearing him, he sprang forward disregarding
his antagonist's words, and took up his bow. And flying unto fury,
Sumitra's son, darting up, took out arrows from his quiver, and
stretched his mighty bow in front of Atikaya. And filling the entire
earth and the sky and the ocean and all the cardinal quarters,--the
terrific twang of Lakshmana's bow struck terror into the (hearts of the)
night-rangers. And hearing the dreadful twang of the bow of Sumitra's
son, the exceedingly energetic and powerful son of the lord of Rakshasas
was struck with surprise. Then Atikaya, enraged, seeing Lakshmana
advance, taking sharpened shafts, spoke unto him,--"Thou art a boy, O
Sumitra's son; and as such knowest not how to display prowess. Go thou.
Why wishest thou to fight with me resembling Death itself. Not Himalaya
itself or the firmament or the earth is capable of bearing the
impetuosity of shafts shot by my arms. Thou wishest to rouse a fire
slumbering sweetly. Leaving alone thy bow, do thou return. Do not lose
thy life by coming in contact with me. Or it may be that thou art proud;
and, therefore, hast no mind to return. Stay then. Renouncing thy life,
thou shalt go to Yama's mansion. Behold my whetted arrows--crushers of
the insolence of foes--resembling the weapon itself of the
Lord,[256]--adorned with burnished gold. And even as a lion enraged
sheddeth the blood of a mighty elephant, this arrow of mine resembling a
serpent shall shed thy blood". Having delivered himself thus, he fired
with wrath set his shaft on his bow. Hearing in that encounter Atikaya's
wrathful speech fraught with hauteur, the highly powerful and
intelligent son of the king possessed of exceeding grace, was
transported with passion; and he said,--"Thou canst not attain
pre-eminence solely by virtue of thy speech. One cannot be a worthy
person simply by say. O wicked-minded one, do thou display thy strength
on me equipped with the bow and holding arrows in my hands. To-day shall
my shafts decked in gold, drink thy blood flowing from thy person and
issuing out of wounds inflicted by my arrows resembling darts.--'This
one is a boy', thinking this, thou ought not to slight me. Whether I am
a boy or an old[257] man--death shalt thou know in the conflict. It was
as a boy that Vishnu had overpowered the triune world with his prowess".
Hearing Lakshmana's words, fraught with reason and high sense,
Vidyadharas and ghosts, deities, Daityas and Maharshis, and the
high-souled Guhyakas then beheld that marvel.[258]

Then Atikaya, enraged, setting his arrow on his bow, shot it at
Lakshmana, as if devouring up the welkin. Thereat, Lakshmana--slayer of
hostile heroes--with a crescent severed that sharpened shaft resembling
a venomous serpent, as it was descending. And seeing the shaft severed,
like a serpent having its person cut off, Atikaya waxing exceedingly
enraged, took up five arrows; and the night-ranger discharged them at
Lakshmana. Thereat Bharata's younger brother cut off the approaching
arrows with whetted shafts. And having severed them with sharpened
shafts, Lakshmana--slayer of hostile heroes--took up a sharpened arrow,
as if flaming in energy. And taking it, Lakshmana set it on his
excellent bow; and drawing the latter, vigorously discharged the shaft.
And that hero endowed with prowess hit that foremost of Rakshasas in the
forehead with that shaft having bent knots, discharged from his bow
drawn to its full bent.--And that arrow piercing the forehead of that
dreadful Rakshasa, and smeared with blood, appeared like the lord of
serpents in a mountain. And the Rakshasa, smarting under Lakshmana's
shaft, showered, like the dreadful gateway of Tripuri battered by Rudra.
Then recovering himself and reflecting, he said,[259]--"Excellent well!
By this discharge of thy shaft, thou approvest thyself as a foe in whom
I can well glory". Having spoken thus candidly, he, folding his hands at
ease, and seated on the platform of his car, began to range in it. And
then that foremost of Rakshasas began to take up, set, and shoot one,
three, five, or seven shafts. And those shafts resembling Fate itself,
plated with gold at the feathered parts,--and looking like the Sun
himself (in splendour),--discharged from the bow of the lord of
Rakshasas, lighted up the heavens. Thereat Raghava's younger brother by
means of many a sharpened shaft calmly cut off all those vollies of
arrows shot by the Rakshasa. And finding all those arrows riven in the
encounter, that enemy of the lord of the immortals, Ravana's son, was
fired with wrath, and took up a whetted shaft. And then aiming that
arrow, that highly powerful one suddenly shot it; and with that, rushing
on, hit Sumitra's son in the chest. And struck in the encounter by
Atikaya, the son of Sumitra began to bleed copiously, like a mad
elephant discharging the temporal juice. And then that lord at once
extricated the arrow; and then took up a keen shaft and fixed the same
on his weapon.[260] And then he set a shaft (on his bow-string) reciting
a formula for the Agneya[261] weapon; and thereat his arrow as well as
bow flamed up. Then the highly powerful Atikaya took up a Raudra[262]
weapon; and thereon fixed a shaft plated with gold at the feathered
part, and resembling a serpent in sheen. And even as the Reaper hurleth
his rod, did Lakshmana hurl that weapon inspired with divine energy,
dreadful and aflame,--at Atikaya. And seeing that shaft set upon an
Agneya weapon, that night-ranger discharged a Raudra arrow set upon a
Solar weapon. And there like a pair of infuriated serpents, those arrows
with their heads flaming in energy, baffled each other in the sky. And
burning each other, the shafts fell on the earth; and those best of
arrows, shorn of brilliance and reduced to ashes, were deprived of their
splendour. And having blazed in the welkin, those two fell down to the
earth reft of their lustre, Then Atikaya wrought up with wrath
discharged an arrow called Aishika dedicated to Tashtri. Thereat the
powerful son of Sumitra severed that shaft by an Aindra[263] weapon.
Seeing Aishika baffled, that Prince--son unto Ravana--fired with rage,
fixed an arrow on a Yamya[264] weapon; and then the night-ranger shot
that weapon at Lakshmana. And Lakshmana resisted it by a Vayavya[265]
weapon. And then as a mass of clouds poureth down showers, Lakshmana,
enraged, poured volleys of shafts on Ravana's son. Thereupon, hitting
Atikaya, those arrows coming in contact with his mail, had their barbs
broken, and fell down to the earth. And seeing them baffled, that slayer
of hostile heroes--the renowned Lakshmana--began to shower shafts by
thousands. And albeit showered with those arrows, that Rakshasa--the
mighty Atikaya--in that encounter was not pierced by them on account of
his impenetrable mail; and that best of men failed to hurt him in the
contest. Then approaching him, the Wind-god spake unto him,
saying,--"This one hath received a boon from Brahma, and is covered with
an impenetrable mail. Pierce him with a Brahma[266] weapon. He cannot
otherwise be slain. This one clad in mail and endowed with prowess is
forsooth incapable of being slain by others". Hearing the words of the
Wind-god, Sumitra's son like unto Indra in prowess took an arrow endowed
with fierce impetuosity, and at once set it on a Brahma weapon. And on
that sharp-headed best of arrows being fixed on that foremost of
weapons, the cardinal quarters and the Moon and the Sun and the mighty
planets and the sky were seized with affright; and the earth shook. And
inspiring that arrow furnished with a feathered part and resembling an
emissary of Yama himself, and fixing the same an his bow, Sumitra's son
in that encounter discharged that shaft like unto the thunder-bolt at
the son of the enemy of Indra. And in that conflict Atikaya beheld that
shaft fair-feathered and having its feathered part dight with splendid
diamonds, acquiring enhanced vehemence arising from its having been
discharged by Lakshmana,--and hissing and rushing on with tremendous
impetuosity. And seeing it, Atikaya swiftly resisted it with countless
sharpened shafts. But endowed with the energy of Suparna himself, that
shaft vehemently went to him. And seeing that shaft flaming and
resembling the Fatal Destroyer himself,--coming, he, exerting himself to
the utmost resisted it with darts and _rishtis_ and maces and adzes and
javelins and arrows. But beating down all those weapons of wonderful
forms, that arrow alive with flames, coming to the diadem-decked head of
Atikaya, severed the same (in twain) And that head furnished with a
corsalet, cut off by Lakshmana's arrow, suddenly dropped to the earth,
like a summit of Himavan toppling (to the ground). Seeing him rolling on
the earth, with his attire and ornaments scattered about, those
night-rangers that survived were overwhelmed with grief. And with pale
forces and distressed, they, fatigued in consequence of the thrashing
they had undergone, suddenly began to cry in frightful accents. And on
their leader having been slain, those night-rangers that were about
(Atikaya), without waiting any longer,--overwhelmed with panic, rushed
towards the city. And on their foe endowed with terrific prowess and
incapable of being confronted, having been slain, innumerable monkeys
filled with excess of joy, and displaying countenances resembling blown
lotuses, paid homage unto Lakshmana working out their welfare.

SECTION LXIXII.


Hearing Atikaya slain by the high-souled Lakshmana, the king was filled
with exceeding great anxiety and spoke thus,--"Dhumraksha exceedingly
wrathful,--best of those equipped with all arms--and Akampana and
Prahasta and Kumbhakarna--all these exceedingly mighty heroes--Rakshasas
ever seeking warfare, conquerers of the forces of foes, and never
defeated by antagonists, have together with their hosts been slain by
Rama of untiring feats. And other Rakshasas having gigantic bodies and
skilled in various arms,--countless high-souled heroes--have also been
brought down. These brothers were formerly bound by my son Indrajit of
renowned strength and prowess with terrific shafts, obtained as boons.
And I do not know by what power or superhuman virtue or stupifying
energy did those brothers--Rama and Lakshmana--liberate themselves from
those dreadful bonds, which could be loosed neither by celestials nor
the highly powerful Asuras combined nor Yakyas, Gandharbas and Pannagas.
And all those heroic Rakshasa warriors that marched forth at my bidding,
have been destroyed by monkeys of marvellous might. Him see I not that
can now slay Rama with Lakshmana,--that hero together with his forces
and Sugriva and Bibhishana. Alack! mighty must be Rama and wondrous is
his strength of weapon--he coming in contact with whose prowess, these
Rakshasas have met with their deaths. Now let this palace be everywhere
guarded by a vigilant garrison,--as also the _acoka_ wood where Sita is
being guarded. We should always be acquainted with the ingress and
egress (of every person). And do ye, surrounded by forces, remain where
there are garrisons. And the night-rangers should in the evening, at
midnight and in the morning always watch the movements of the monkeys.
The monkeys should by no means be slighted. And ye should know whether
the enemy putteth forth (fresh) efforts,--and whether they advance or
remain stationed where they at present are".--Thereupon those exceeding
mighty Rakshasas did as they had been desired. And having directed them,
Ravana--lord of Rakshasas--bearing the dart of ire (in his heart), in
forlorn guise entered his own mansion. And with the fire of his rage
blazing up, the exceedingly powerful sovereign of the night-rangers,
absorbed with the danger that had befallen his son, began to sigh
momentarily.



SECTION LXXIII.


Those Rakshas that remained after the others had been slain, swiftly
informed Ravana that all those foremost of Rakshasas--Devantaka and the
rest, Triciras, Atikaya and others--had been slain. And suddenly hearing
them slain, the king with his eyes charged with brine, thinking of the
disastrous destruction of his sons and brothers, was extremely agonized.
Thereupon, seeing the king afflicted, and sunk in a sea of sorrow, that
foremost of car-warriors--son unto the Rakshasa king--Indrajit,
addressed (his sire), saying,--"O father, it doth not behove thee to be
overcome with this excessive grief, inasmuch as, O lord of Nairitas,
Indrajit yet breaths. Smit by the enemy of Indra, (Raghava) can by no
means save his life in encounter. To-day behold Rama along with
Lakshmana with their bodies torn with my shafts,--lying down lifeless on
the ground, having their persons covered with my sharpened arrows! Hear
this vow of the foe of Indra, never swerving and instinct with prowess
and divinity,--this very day will I with unfailing shafts slay Rama
along with Lakshmana. To-day let Indra and Vaivacwata and Vishnu and
Rudra and Sadhyas and Vaicwas and men and the Sun and the Moon, behold
my immeasurable prowess, terrific like that of Vishnu at the sacrificial
ground of Vali". Having spoken thus, that foe of the lord of celestials
endowed with exceeding energy, taking the king's permission, ascended a
car having the velocity of the wind itself, yoked with asses, and
furnished with every variety of weapons. And ascending the car,
resembling the car of Hari himself, that exceedingly powerful repressor
of enemies at once set out for the field of battle. And as that
high-souled (hero) marched, he was followed by countless mighty
(Rakshasas) breathing spirits; bearing bows in their strong hands. And
some of those, resembling mountains, were mounted on elephants, and some
on superb steeds, and some on bears, and some on beasts of prey, and
some on lions and jackals,--and some of the Rakshasas endowed with
dreadful vigor were mounted on crows, and some on swans, and some on
peacocks,--they were equipped with _pracas_ and maces and _nistrincas_
and axes and clubs. And all sides were filled with the blares of conchs
and the sounds of kettle-drums. And then that enemy of the lord of
celestials marched forth with impetuosity. And with an umbrella hued
like the Moon, that destroyer of enemies appeared like the full Moon
stationed in the sky. And that hero garnished in golden ornaments--that
foremost of all bowmen--was fanned by an excellent and graceful golden
_chowri_. And with Indrajit furnished with the splendour of the Sun
himself, and possessed of peerless prowess, Lanka, looked beauteous even
as the firmament graced with the glorious Sun.

Arriving at the scene of conflict, that highly powerful repressor of
foes arrayed his forces around the car. And then that foremost of
Rakshasas with choice mantras duly offered libations unto Fire.[267] And
that powerful lord of Rakshasas there worshipping Fire with fragrant
wreaths and fried paddy, sacrificed unto it. And arms served for _Kaca_
and _Bibhitakas_ for fuel; and there were red cloths and a ladle made of
black iron. And spreading Fire there, with _tomaras_ representing
_Kaca_, he seized the neck of a living goat. And then the kindled
smokeless fire blazing up brilliantly, displayed signs betokening
victory. Thereat, with his right tongue whirling, the Deity of Fire
himself looking like one made of gold,--arising, accepted the offering.
And then that (Rakshasa) skilled in weapons acquired a Brahma weapon
(from that Deity), and inspired his bow and car with _mantras_. On that
weapon having been invoked,[268] and on (the god of Fire) also having
been worshipped, the firmament furnished with the suns and stars and
planets was afflicted with affright. Having worshipped (the god of
Fire), that one endowed with the splendour of Fire itself, that one
possessed of the prowess of the great Indra and gifted with
inconceivable vigor, accoutred in bows and arrows and swords and having
steeds and cars and darts,--disappeared in the sky. Then burning for
battle, setting up roars went out the Rakshasa ranks, thronging with
steeds and cars, and graced with pennons and standards. And they fell to
slaughtering monkeys in the engagement with countless shafts, sharp,
variegated and decorated; as also with _tomaras_ and _hooks_. And
Ravana's son, fired with wrath, seeing those night-rangers, addressed
them, saying,--"Do ye, burning with a desire to destroy the monkeys,
fight cheerfully". Thereat all those Rakshasas, eager for victory,
smitting roars, covered the dreadful monkeys with showers of shafts. And
environed by Rakshas in that encounter, he[269] poured on the monkeys
_nalikas_ and _narachas_ and maces and clubs. And trembling in the
encounter, those monkeys armed with trees at once began to shower rocks
and trees on Ravana's son. Then the exceedingly powerful Indrajit, son
unto Ravana, endowed with wondrous energy, pierced the bodies of the
monkeys (with arrows). And fired with wrath, that (hero) rejoicing the
Rakshasas with a single shaft pierced nine and seven monkeys in that
encounter. And that invincible hero in that conflict mangled the monkeys
with shafts resembling the Sun, decked with gold. And their persons
pierced in that contest, and themselves pained with those arrows, they
began to fall down, giving up all intention of fight, like mighty Asuras
smit by the celestials. And then waxing highly enraged, those
considerable monkeys in that conflict hotly pursued (Indrajit)
resembling the Sun himself and having terrific arrows for his rays. And
all the monkeys, with their bodies riven and deprived of their senses,
and bathed in blood and writhing in torments,--pursued (Indrajit). And
putting forth their prowess in behalf of Rama, those monkeys, equipped
with rocks in the encounter, who had set apart their very lives (for
him), paused, shouting up loudly. And they in that conflict showered
trees and crags and mountain-tops on Ravana's son. And that destroyer of
foes--the exceedingly energetic son unto Ravana--resisted that mighty
shower of trees and stones capable of compassing destruction. Then that
Lord pierced the monkey-hosts in the encounter with shafts resembling
fire or venomous serpents. And piercing Gandhamadana with eight and ten
sharp arrows, he wounded Nila stationed at a distance with nine shafts.
And that one endowed with redoubtable prowess pierced Mainda with seven
shafts capable of piercing into the pith; and he pierced Gaja with five
shafts in the encounter. And he pierced Jambavan with ten and Nila with
thirty. And then with dreadful sharp shafts obtained as boons, he
rendered Sugriva and Rishabha and Angada and Dwivida (almost) lifeless.
And transported with passion, and resembling the Five arisen at
Doomsday, Indrajit, harassed other principal monkeys with countless
arrows. And in that terrific conflict, he agitated the monkey-hosts with
swift-speeding shafts, resembling the Sun himself, deftly discharged
(from his bow). Then in that encounter, leaving his army, Indrajit
became suddenly invisible unto the monkey-hosts,--and began to shower
fierce arrows, like dark clouds pouring rain. And with their persons
torn by the arrows of the conqueror of Sakra,--slain by his power of
illusion,--with their teeth uprooted, those mountain-like monkeys fell
down in the field, emitting frightful cries,--like a mountain smit with
Indra's thunderbolt. And in the conflict they could only see sharp
pointed shafts among the monkey-ranks; but that foe of the celestial
chief--the Rakshasa, hidden by virtue of illusion, they could not
discover there. And then the high-souled lord of Rakshas covered all
sides with sharp-pointed shafts resembling the rays of the Sun; and he
rived the foremost monkeys. And whirling darts and _nistraicas_ and
axes, flaming and having the effulgence of Fire,--and furnished with
flames shooting forth sparks,--he discharged them furiously at the
forces of the sovereign of monkeys. And the monkey-leaders struck with
Sakrajit's shafts resembling flames, appeared like laughing Kincukas.
And some looking at the sky were struck at their eyes. And they
gradually began to hide themselves in each other and drop to the earth.
And that foremost of Rakshasas--Indrajit--with _pracas_ and darts and
whetted arrows, inspired with _mantras_, pierced all those powerful
monkeys,--Hanuman and Sugriva and Angada and Gandhamadana and Jambavan
and Sushena and Vegadarcin, and Mainda and Dwivida and Nila and Gavaksha
and Gavaya and Kesari and Hariloman and the monkey Vidyutdanshtra and
Suryyanana and Jyotimukha and the monkey Dadhimukha and Pavakaksha and
Nala and the monkey Kumuda. And having pierced those foremost monkeys
with golden-hued maces, he showered on Rama and Lakshmana arrows
resembling the rays of the Sun. And showered with those vollies of
arrows, Rama, without heeding that discharge resembling a very
downpour,--reflecting, spoke unto Lakshmana,--"O Lakshmana, this lord of
Rakshasas, this foe of the lord of celestials, having obtained the
Brahma weapon,--after having brought down the monkey-hosts, are
assailing us with sharpened shafts. And that high-souled heedful one,
having been given a boon by the Self-sprung, hath rendered his dreadful
body invisible. How can we slay him, who is fighting with upraised
weapons, but who hath hid his body. The reverend Self-sprung, I deem, is
incomprehensible. And this is his weapon, embodying his energy.
Therefore, O intelligent one, do thou to-day along with me calmly bear
this. And let this foremost them all--this lord of Rakshasas--cover all
sides with the showers of his shafts. And in consequence of this, the
army of the monkey-king with its greatest heroes fallen, doth not appear
to advantage. And seeing us also fallen senseless, and desisting from
fight with our joy and anger gone off from us, for certain will the
enemy of the immortals, taking the Fortune of fight seek his home". And
assailed by Indra with networks of arrows, they were then sore
distressed the field. And having struck them with sadness, Indra from
joy shouted in the encounter. And having thus worst in battle that
monkey-army and Rama along with Lakshmana he speedily entered the city
ruled by the hand of the Ten-necked one. And extolled by the Yatudhanas,
he, filled with delight, related everything unto his sire.

      Fire.

[268] _i.e._ on the deity presiding over that weapon, being invoked.

[269] Indrajit.



SECTION LXXIV.


And they[270] were rendered inert in the field; and the army of the
monkey-leaders was stupified, with Sugriva and Nila and Angada and
Jambavan,--and they did not show any signs of activity. Thereupon,
seeing them dispirited, that foremost of intelligent
persons--Bibhishana--cheering them up with his peerless speech,
said,--"Ye heroes of the king of monkeys, do not give way to fear. This
is not the time to indulge in grief at this place; for the sons of the
noble one,[271]--inactive and depressed, and seeming to be wounded with
the showers of Indrajit's shafts,--are in reality in this plight, for
showing reverence unto the words[272] of the Self-sprung one.--On him
the Self-sprung hath conferred the mighty Brahma, weapon of unfailing
power; and the king's sons are doing honour to it by lying down on the
field of battle. Why then do ye grieve now?" Hearing the words of
Bibhishana and honoring the Brahma weapon, Hanuman spoke as
follows:--"The host of the quick-paced monkeys hath been slain by this
weapon. Let us go and console them who are still living". And those two
great heroes--Hanuman and that foremost of the Rakshasas, with
fire-brands in their hands, began to range to and fro in the battle
field. And they beheld there the earth strewn on all sides with monkeys
lying down like so many hills and various shining weapons. And some of
these monkeys were deprived of their tails, some of their hands, some of
their thighs, some of their legs, some of their fingers, and some of
their heads. And blood was gushing out from the persons of some, and
others were urinating out of fear. And Bibhishana and Hanuman beheld
there Sugriva, Angada, Nila, Gandhamldana, Jambavan, Sushena,
Vegadarshin, Mainda, Nala, Jyotimukha, and the monkey, Dwivida,--almost
slain. And Bibhishana and Hanuman saw in the field seven and sixty kotis
of fleet-footing monkeys slain (in battle) at the fifth part of the day
by the darling of the Self-sprung. And surveying that host worsted,
dreadful like the surges of the sea, Hanuman and Bibhishana began to
search for Jambavan. And finding that heroic son of Prajapati, afflicted
with natural decrepitude, aged, and resembling smouldering
fire,--wounded with hundreds of shafts, Pulastya's son said,--"O noble
one, hath not thy life been destroyed with those sharp shafts?" Hearing
Bibhishana's words, Jambavan--best of bears--evoking utterance with
extreme effort, said,--"O foremost of Nairitas, endowed with exceeding
prowess, I know thee by thy voice. Having my person pierced with sharp
shafts, I cannot see thee with my eyes. Doth he through whom Anjana as
well as Mataricwa[273] are blessed with fair offspring,--doth that
prince of monkeys--Hanuman--live?" Hearing Jambavan's speech, Bibhishaua
said,--"Why, passing by the son of the high and mighty,[274] dost thou
enquire after the Wind-god's offspring? O noble one, thou dost not show
that overflowing affection either for king Sugriva or Raghava that thou
showest for the son of the Wind-god". Hearing Bibhishana's words,
Jambavan said,--"Hear, O foremost of Rakshasas, why I enquire after the
Wind-god's son. While this hero is alive, this force, albeit destroyed,
liveth; but if Hanuman is reft of life, although living, we are
destroyed. O child, if the Wind-god's offspring, resembling his sire
himself or (the deity of) Fire in prowess, is alive, there is hope for
our lives". Then approaching that aged one, Hanuman--son unto the Wind
god--saluted him humbly, holding Jambavan's feet. Hearing Hanuman's
voice, that foremost of monkeys, with his senses sorely smarting, deemed
himself as having regained his life. Then that exceedingly energetic one
addressed Hanuman, saying,--"Come, O powerful monkey. It behoveth thee
to rescue the monkeys. There is none else. Endowed with profuse prowess,
thou art the greatest friend of these. This is the hour when thou
shouldst display thy might. Any other see I not. Do thou cheer up this
host consisting of bears and monkeys; and do thou also heal the wounds
of these two tormented by them. Bounding sheer over the main, thou, O
Hanuman, shouldst repair to the Himavan--foremost of mountains. There
thou wilt see that best of mountains--the golden Rishabha of terrific
aspect, and, smiter of foes, the peak also of Kailaca. Lying in the Up
of these two, thou, O hero, O powerful monkey, wilt see the mountain of
medicines, fraught with healing herbs of all kinds. On its summit thou
wilt find four medicinal herbs flaming and illumining the ten cardinal
quarters--_viz_., Mritasanjivani,[275] Vicalyakarani,[276]
Suvarnakarani,[277] and the mighty medicine, Sandhani. O Hanuman,
providing thyself with these, thou shouldst come hither without delay.
Do thou, O offspring of the Wind-god[278] bringing back lives unto these
monkeys, cheer them up". Thereat Hanuman filled himself with energy,
even as the Ocean heaveth with the force of the winds (blowing on its
breast). And ascending the summit of that mountain,[279] and hurting it
with his tread, that hero--Hanuman--appeared like a second mountain, And
crushed under the tread of that monkey, the mountain was dispirited; and
sore distressed, it could hardly contain itself. And the trees on it
began to topple to the earth; and on account of the vehemence of the
monkey, they flamed up. And smitten by Hanuman, its peaks were scattered
around. And monkeys could no longer dwell on that foremost of mountains,
which, being hard pressed (by Hanuman), was trembling all over, with its
slopes covered with broken trees and rocks. And with her giant gateways
shaking, and the doors of her edifices broken, that night Lanka,
overwhelmed with fright, seemed to be dancing. And the offspring of the
Wind-god, resembling a mountain itself, bringing that mountain to sore
straits, agitated the entire earth with her Oceans. And hurting the
mountain with his tread, he, opening wide his mouth resembling that of a
mare, sent up loud shouts, terrifying the night-rangers. And hearing
those tremendous roars as he kept emitting cries, the powerful Rakshasas
were quite stupified. And bowing down unto the Ocean, that subduer of
enemies, the Wind-god's son, endowed with dreadful prowess, began to
ponder over the mighty mission with which he had been entrusted in the
interests of Raghava.--And, then upraising his tail resembling a
serpent, bending his back, contracting his ears, and opening his mouth
looking like that of a mare, that one possessed of terrific impetuosity,
bounded into the sky. And with the vehemence of his rush,--he carried
away in his wake whole tracts of trees, and rocks, and crags, and
inferior monkeys;[280] and after having been carried away some distance
by the vehemence of his arms and thighs, they, at length losing their
velocity, fell into the waters (of the Ocean.) And stretching his arms
resembling serpents, the son of the Wind-god endowed with the prowess of
Garuda[281] coursed on towards the monarch of mountains, as if making
all the quarters tremble. And seeing the sea with its hosts of billows
rolling furiously, and with the confederacies of aquatic animals
bewildered by the angry waters, he coursed on rapidly, like the discus
discharged by the hand of Vishnu. And surveying hills and birds and
pools and rivers and tanks and splendid cities and flourishing
provinces, that one equal to his sire himself in celerity, held his way.
And that hero--Hanuman--like unto his father in prowess, and incapable
of being fatigued, vigorously proceeded along the orbit of the Sun. And
that powerful monkey possessed of the speed of the Wind itself, and
having mighty impetuosity, careered, making all sides resound with his
roars. And remembering Jambavan's words, that redoubtable monkey, son
unto the Wind-god, possessed of terrific prowess, and resembling a
mountain, suddenly saw (before him) the Himavan: furnished with
countless cascades and numerous caves and rivulets; with splendid
summits appearing like massess of pale clouds; and graced with various
trees. And arriving at that lord of mighty mountains, furnished with
excellent towering golden summits, he saw the great sacred asylums (of
the ascetics), inhabited by the flower of celestial saints. And he saw
Brahmakoca[282] and Rajatalaya[283] and Sakralaya[284] and
Rudracarapramoksha[285] and Hayanana[286] and the flaming
Brahmaciras,[287] and the servants of Vaivacwata.[288] And he saw the
abode of the Fire-god, and the abode of Vaicravana and the effulgent
Suryyanivandhana.[289] and the abode of Brahma,[290] and the bow of
Sankara, and the navel of the Earth.[291] And he saw Kailaca of terrific
aspect, and the stone[292] of Himavan, and that bull,[293] and the
golden mountain, and that foremost of mountains furnished with all
medicinal herbs, flaming, and illuminated with every kind of medicinal
plants. And beholding that flaming mass of fire, the offspring of
Vasava's[294] emissary wondered. And bounding up to the lord of
medicinal mountains, he fell to searching for the drugs. And that mighty
monkey--the Wind-god's son--leaving behind a thousand _yojanas_, began
to range the mountain containing the divine remedies in its entrails.
And those potent medicines, in that foremost of mountains, knowing
(before-hand) that one was coming seeking for them, rendered themselves
invisible. And not seeing them, the high-souled Hanuman was angered; and
from wrath he set up roars. And not brooking that, (Hanuman) with eyes
resembling glowing fire, addressed that foremost of mountains,
saying,--"What is this that thou hast decided on, that thou showest no
compassion for Raghava? But, O lord of mountains, to-day witness
thyself, overpowered by my arms and torn in pieces!" And (anon) on a
sudden, he violently rooted up its summit with trees and elephants and
gold, and furnished with a thousand varieties of ore,--having its tops
torn and its slopes aflame. And uprooting it, he sprang into (the bosom
of the air), terrifying the worlds containing celestials and the lords
thereof. And hymned by countless rangers of the air, that one endowed
with the terrific impetuosity of Garuda himself, taking that summit
furnished with the splendour of the Sun, went along the orbit of the
Sun. And near the Sun, that Sun-like one seemed to be another Sun. And
with that mountain, the offspring of the bearer of perfumes appeared
surpassingly grand, like very Vishnu equipped with the flaming discus
having a thousand edges. And seeing him, the monkeys shouted,--and he
also, seeing then, shouted in delight. And hearing their tremendous
cheers, those residing in Lanka shouted still more dreadfully. And then
the high-souled one dropped on that best of mountains in the midst of
the monkey-forces; and, bowing down unto the principal monkeys there, he
embraced Bibhishana. And then those sons of that king of men, smelling
the perfume of that mighty medicine, were then and there healed of their
wounds; and the heroic monkeys also sat up. And all the heroic monkeys
were instantly healed and cured; and those also that were slain (in
battle), through the smell of that best of drugs, sat up, like persons
risen after sleep at break of day. Ever since the monkeys and Rakshasas
had begun to fight, for maintaining honor, all those Rakshasas that were
slain there by the mighty monkeys, were thrown into the sea. Then that
monkey, the offspring of the bearer of fragrance, endowed with terrific
speed, took that medicinal mountain (back) unto Himavan and again
presented himself before Rama.

Then the exceedingly energetic lord of monkeys, Sugriva, said unto
Hanuman these words fraught with import,--"Inasmuch as Kumbhakarna hath
been slain as also the princes,[295] Ravana can no longer defend the
city.[296] Now let those principal monkeys that are endowed with great
strength and that are furnished with fleetness, taking fire-brands (in
their hands) rapidly rush towards Lanka". Then when the Sun had set and
at the terrific front of Night, those foremost of monkeys marched
towards Lanka, equipped with fire-brands. And charged at all points by
numbers of monkeys armed with fire-brands, those fierce-eyed (Rakshasas)
that guarded the gates[297] suddenly fled away. And thereat, (the
monkeys) delighted set fire to gates and upper apartments and spacious
high-ways and various by-ways and edifices. And the fire[298] burnt
their[299] mansions by thousands; and mountain-like superstructures
toppled headlong to the earth. And there burnt _aguru_, and sweet
sandal, and pearls, and sheeny gems, and diamonds and corals. And there
burnt linen and fine silk and _avikas_ and various kinds of woolen
cloths; and vessels of gold, and weapons; divers kinds of furniture,
trappings and ornaments of steeds; cords for tying elephants; burnished
ornaments for cars; armour of warriors; and hides of horses and
elephants. And swords and bows and bow-strings and arrows and
_tomaras_[300] and _ankucas_[301] and darts. And blankets and _chowris_
and tiger-skins and musk and other things. And pearls and excellent
gems; and edifices all around. And there the fire burneth heaps of
various kinds of arms. And then the fire burnt various kinds of curious
structures, and the dwellings of Rakshasas and all householders. And
there the fire flaming up again and again burnt down by hundreds and
thousands the houses of the denizons of Lanka,--clad in curious golden
mail; and wearing wreaths and ornaments and attires; having their eyes
wildly moving in intoxication; reeling in drink; those whose paramours
were dressed in flowing apparels; or those wroth with their foes; or
bearing maces and darts and swords in their hands; or engaged in eating
or drinking; or asleep with their beloved on costly couches; or who,
agitated with fright, were hastily going taking their sons with
them.--And that fire burnt down firm-based rich dwellings furnished with
innumerable apartments, and garnished with golden Moons and
crescents,--and mansions having graceful crests; and variegated windows
and daises raised there, embellished with rubies and lapises, and
seeming to touch the Sun; and piles resembling mountains in
grandeur,--and resonant with the cries of Kraunchas and peacocks and the
tinklings of ornaments. And the flaming gateways all round appeared like
clouds in the rainy season lighted up by lightning, or like the peaks of
a mighty mountain ablaze with a forest-conflagration. And superb damsels
asleep in lofty edifices,[302] being burnt, cast away their ornaments
and shrieked. And consumed by the fire, buildings began to drop down
like the summits of a mighty mountain smit with the thunder-bolt of the
thunderer. And those burning, appeared from a distance like the peaks of
Himalaya aglow. And in consequence of those tops of the edifices burning
and of the living flames, that night Lanka looked as if swarming with
flowering Kincukas. And with elephant-riders, and elephants, and steeds
let loose, Lanka appeared like the Ocean at the hour of Universal
tumbling,--with its ferocious aquatic animals whirling in wild chaos.
Sometimes, an elephant seeing a steed let loose,--was flying away in
fear; and sometimes a horse seeing a frightened elephant, was stopping,
himself seized with fear.--And on Lanka burning, the mighty main with
the reflection (of the conflagration) looked like an Ocean of red
waters. And in a short time that city set on fire by the monkeys, looked
like the earth glowing at the time of the Universal dissolution. And the
cries of the females amidst the drift of smoke, heated by the flames,
could be heard from an hundred Yojanas. And as Rakshasas having their
bodies burnt came out of houses, monkeys eager for encounter on a sudden
sprung upon them. And the shouts of the monkeys and the cries of the
Rakshasas made the ten cardinal quarters and the ocean and the Earth
resound.

And on those high souled ones--both Rama and Lakshmana--having been
cured of their wounds, possessing themselves in calmness, took up their
excellent bows. And Rama drew that best of bows. And thereat there was
heard a tremendous twang striking terror into the Rakshasas. And drawing
his redoubtable bow, Rama appeared like the reverend enraged Bhava,
drawing his bow having sounds and instinct with Brahma energy. And the
twang of Rama's bow, drowning the roars of both the monkeys and the
Rakshasas,--was alone heard. And the ululations of the monkeys and the
cries of the Rakshasas and the rattle of Rama's bow--these three filled
the ten cardinal quarters. And with the shafts discharged from his bow,
the gateway of the city resembling the summit of Kailaca was crushed in
pieces, scattered around on the ground. And seeing Rama's shafts in cars
and dwellings, the preparations for conflict were pushed on with great
vigor. And in consequence of the foremost Rakshasas preparing for fight,
and emitting roars, that night appeared like the Fatal Night itself. And
the foremost monkeys were directed by the high-souled Sugriva,
saying,--"Ye monkeys, do ye fight, approaching the gate lying at hand.
But he that flyeth from his ranks, should be slain by main force". As
the principal monkeys stationed themselves at the gate, equipped with
fire brands, wrath took possession of Ravana. And as he yawned, the wind
(blowing from his mouth), filled the ten cardinal regions; and his wrath
resembled that appearing in the person of Rudra. And wrought up with a
mighty rage, he sent forth Kumbha and Nikumbha--both sons of
Kumbhakarna--in company with innumerable Rakshasas.--And in accordance
with Ravana's command, Yupaksha and Sonitaksha, and Prajangha, and
Kampana went with Kumbhakarna's sons. And, setting up leonine roars, he
commanded all those highly powerful Rakshasas, saying,--"Do ye go this
very day for battle". Thus directed, those heroic Rakshasas, equipped
with flaming weapons, went out, roaring again and again. And the
firmament was illuminated with the splendour of the ornaments of the
Rakshasas and the splendour of their persons and the fire kindled by the
monkeys. And there the light of the Moon and that of the stars and the
brilliance of their ornaments,--combined, lighted up the welkin.--And
the beams of the Moon and the brilliance of the ornaments and the
flaming splendour of the planets emblazoned all round the forces of the
monkeys and Rakshasas. And the light of half-burnt houses, again,
falling on the restless ripples of the sea, made it wear an extremely
beautiful aspect. And those dreadful Rakshasa hosts, possessed of
dreadful prowess and energy, were seen,--with ensigns and banners;
excellent swords and _paracwadhas_,[303] terrific steeds and cars and
elephants rife with _paths_,[304] and flaming darts and clubs and
scimitars and _yrasas_ and _tomaras_ and bows; bearing blazing _prasas_;
ringing with the tinklings of hundreds of balls; with their arms encased
in golden networks; flourishing axes; whirling their mighty weapons;
fixing shafts on their bows; making the air swoon away with the perfumes
of their wreaths; extremely terrific; swarming with heroes; sending out
sounds like those of the sea. And seeing the army of the Rakshasas
incapable of being coped with advance, the monkey-forces began to move
and send up loud cheers. And thereat that array of Rakshasas vehemently
sprang forward before the force of the foe, like unto insects plunging
into aflame. And whirling with their arms bludgeons and _acanis_, that
army of Rakshasas appeared exceedingly grand. And the monkeys, eager for
encounter, darted forward like maniacs; and began to despatch the
night-rangers with rocks and trees and clenched fist. And Rakshasas
possessed of dreadful prowess with whetted arrows swiftly cut off the
heads of falling monkeys. And the Rakshasas ranged there, with their
ears torn with teeth, or their heads broken by blows, or their limbs
crushed with the discharge of crags. And in the same way other
grim-visaged night-rangers slew with sharpened swords the foremost of
monkeys on all sides. And one about to slay another was himself slain by
the latter; and one, about to bring another down, was himself brought
down (by his adversary), and one that was railing at another, was in
turn rebuked by his enemy; and one who was going to bite his foe, was
himself bitten by him. And one was crying 'Give,'[305] and his adversary
anon giveth; and another, again said,--'I will give. Why puttest thyself
to trouble? Stay.' Thus there did they accost each other. And there was
waged a terrific encounter between the monkeys and the Rakshasas,--in
which arms lay scattered about; and armour and weapons strewn around;
and mighty _pracas_[306] were upraised; and which was fought with blows
and darts and swords and _Kuntalas_.[307] And in that conflict the
Rakshasas slaughtered monkeys by tens and sevens. And then the monkeys
hemmed in the Rakshasa-forces, with their apparels falling off and with
their mail and standards strewn around.

SECTION LXXVI.


On that furious and destructive carnage proceeding. Angada, eager for
encounter, approached the heroic Kampana. Thereat, challenging Angada in
wrath, he assailed him with impetuosity. And Kampana dealt a blow to
Angada with his mace; and thereat, wounded with it, he reeled. Then
regaining his senses, that energetic one hurled a mountain-top. Borne
down by the blow, Akampana dropped down to the earth. And seeing Kampana
slain in the conflict, Sonitaksha mounted on a car, intrepidly rushed
against Angada. And he then impetuosly pierced Angada with sharpened
shafts, keen and capable of cleaving the body and resembling the Fatal
Fire itself in appearance,--with Kshuras[308] and Kshurapras[309] and
Narachas[310] and Vatsadantas[311] and Siliumkhas[312] and Karnis[313]
and Salas[314] and Vipatas,[315] and countless (other) whetted arrows.
And the powerful son of Vali--Angada--endowed with prowess having his
person pierced with arrows suddenly smashed (his adversary's) car and
arrows and dreadful bow. And thereat, Sonitaksha swiftly took up his
sword and shield; and without reflecting for a moment, that vigorous one
sprang forward. And the powerful Angada, speedily bounding up, seized
his enemy's sword and holding the same with his hands shouted. And then
hitting at (Akampana's) shoulder-blade, that powerful
monkey--Angada--hewed him in twain, his blow going obliquely down like
the sacred thread. And taking that terrific sword, and shouting again
and again, in the field, Vali's son rushed against other enemies. And
then strong and heroic Yupaksha accompanied by Prajangha,--mounted on a
car, wrathfully approached the mighty son of Vali. And taking an iron
mace, that hero, Sonitaksha, adorned with a golden _angada_,--attaining
a little respite, advanced against Angada. And that redoubtable hero,
the powerful Prajangha, also, accompanied by Yupaksha, fired with wrath,
equipped with a mace, advanced towards the son of Vali endowed with
exceeding prowess. And placed between those two--Sonitaksha and
Prajangha--that foremost of monkeys appeared like the full Moon placed
between the Visakhas.[316] And Mainda and Dwivida defending Angada,
remained beside him, desirous of witnessing the encounter between those
two (combatants). And fired with fury, those huge-bodied Rakshasas
endowed with dreadful prowess, equipped with swords and shafts and
maces,--being on their guard, fell upon the monkeys. And the encounter
that took place between those three lords of monkeys combined (on one
side), and the three redoubtable Rakshasis (on the other), was dreadful
and capable of making people's down stand on end. And they,[317] taking
up trees, hurled them in the conflict (against their antagonists); and
the powerful Prajangha resisted all those with his swords. And (the
monkeys) in the contest showered rocks and trees on the cars (of their
enemies) and the exceedingly strong Yupaksha cut them off with vollies
of arrows. And the powerful Sonitaksha, endowed with prowess, with his
mace severed in the middle the trees which Dwivida and Mainda had
uprooted and discharged. And summoning speed, Prajangha darted against
Vali's son, upraising a huge scimitar capable of piercing into the
vitals of trees. And seeing him approach, that lord of monkeys possessed
of exceeding strength and great prowess struck him with an Acwakarna
tree; and with a blow smote his antagonist on his arm holding a
_nistringa_. And seeing the sword resembling a mace dropped to the
earth, that exceedingly mighty one clenched his fist into a blow like
unto the levin; and that one, endowed with wondrous energy, smote in the
forehead that foremost of monkeys possessed of redoubtable prowess. And
thereat he for a moment was staggered. And then recovering his senses,
the energetic and powerful son of Vali by means of his clenched fist
severed Prajangha's head from his body. Thereat Yupaksha, seeing his
uncle slain in battle, with his eyes filled with tears, finding his
shafts exhausted, swiftly descended from his car and took a sword. And
finding Yupaksha charge, Dwivida, waxing wroth, speedily smote him on
the breast; and that powerful one also seized him. And finding his
brother taken, the highly energetic Sonitaksha then dealt the mighty
Dwivida a blow in the chest. And overcome by that blow, that one endowed
with great strength, shook; and Dwivida seized his antagonist's upraised
mace. In the meanwhile Mainda came to the side of Dwivida. And
Sonitaksha and Yupaksha, bestirring themselves, began to vehemently and
forcibly drag and pull those (two) monkeys. And Dwivida with his nail
tore Sonhaksha's face; and that powerful one violently bringing him down
to the earth, pressed him with might and main. And fired with wrath,
Mainda--foremost of monkeys--grasped Yupaksha with his arms; and that
one dropt down dead on the earth. And thereupon the force of the lord of
the Rakshasas, having its foremost heroes slain,--and aggrieved thereat,
went to where Kumbhakarna's son was. And then cheering up the flying
forces, that best (of Rakshas),--the energetic Kumbha--seeing that
Raksha host with its mighty heroes slain by highly powerful monkeys
crowned with success, began to perform difficult feats in the encounter.
And needfully taking his bow, that first of bowmen discharged shafts
resembling venomous serpents capable of piercing the body. And his
excellent bow with shafts shone resplendent like the very bow of Indra
himself affluent with the splendour of Airavata and lightning. And then
drawing his bow to its utmost bent, he hit Dwivida with a feathered
shaft knobbed with gold. And suddenly wounded with it, that best of
monkeys having the splendour of Trikuta, fell down senseless to the
earth, stretching his legs wide. And Mainda, seeing his brother, broken
in mighty encounter, furiously rushed forward, taking a gigantic crag;
and that one possessed of great strength, hurled it at the Rakshasa. And
thereat Kumbha severed that crag with fire shafts discharged (from his
bow). And then aiming other fair-headed arrows resembling venomous
snakes, that exceedingly energetic one smote Dwivida's elder brother in
the chest. And struck (with those arrows), that leader of monkey-bands,
Mainda, with his marrow pierced therewith, fell down to the earth,
deprived of his senses. And Angada seeing his uncles[318] endowed with
exceeding prowess, overpowered, darted vehemently at Kumbha staying with
bow upraised. And as he descended, Kumbha pierced him with fire shafts;
and as one pierceth an elephant with _tomaras_, he also pierced (Angada)
with three other arrows. And the powerful Kumbha pierced Angada with a
great many arrows, sharp-pointed, whetted, keen and ornamented with
gold. And Vali's son Angada, albeit pierced all over in his person, did
not shake; and he kept showering on his[319] head stones and trees. And
the graceful son of Kumbhakarna cut off and cleft all those (stone and
trees) discharged by Vali's son. And seeing him spring up, Kumbha
pierced that monkey-leader on the ground with shafts, even as one
assaileth an elephant with fire-brands. And blood gushed out of his
closed eyes. And then covering his eyes with his hand, Angada with
another took a _sala_ that was hard by. And placing on his breast the
_sala_ furnished with shoulders, and pulling its branches and bending
its top, he cleared it of its foliage, in that mighty encounter. And
then in the sight of all the Rakshas he violently discharged that tree
resembling the very banner of Indra and appearing like Mandara itself.
And thereat he[320] severed it with seven sharp shafts capable of
piercing the body. And Angada experienced a sharp pang and fell down
deprived of his senses. And seeing the invincible Angada down like
ebbing sea, the foremost monkeys informed Raghava of it. And Rama,
hearing that Vali's son had come to grief in terrific fight, directed
the principal monkeys, headed by Jambavan. And hearing Rama's command,
the monkeys, fired with wrath, charged Kumbha, staying with his bow
upraised. And those powerful monkeys, with their eyes crimsoned with
choler and bearing rocks and trees in their hands, were engaged in
defending Angada. And Jambavan and Sushena and the monkey, Vegadarci,
wrought with wrath, darted against that hero--son unto Kumbhakarna. And
seeing them spring forward; he covered up those exceedingly mighty lords
of monkey, with showers of shafts, even as a crag obstructeth the course
of a current. And even the great deep cannot see his own shores, those
high-souled lord of monkeys, coining within the range of his arrows,
could not even see. And seeing those monkeys sore distressed by the
shafts, the king of the monkeys, Sugriva, in that conflict taking his
brother's son on his back, rushed against the son of Kumbhakarna, even
as a powerful lion rusheth at an elephant ranging on the slopes of a
mountain. And that mighty monkey, uprooting many an _acwakarna_ and
other mighty trees of various kinds, discharged them (at the foe). And
by means of his sharp arrows the graceful son of Kumbhakarna cut off
that down-pour of trees covering the welkin; and incapable of being
resisted. And being baffled those trees looked like _cataghnis_. And
seeing that shower of trees riven by Kumbha, the graceful lord of the
monkeys endowed with exceeding strength and prowess, did not feel any
mortification. And suddenly attacked, he bearing those arrows, seized
Kumbha's bow resembling in resplendence the very bow of Indra. And
swiftly bounding up and performing that feat difficult of being
achieved, he, exceedingly enraged, addressed Kumbha resembling an
elephant shorn of his tusks, saying,--"O elder brother of Nikumbha,
marvellous are thy might and the force of thyself as well as the modesty
and prowess that are thine and Ravana's. And, O thou equal unto Prahrada
or Vali or the slayer of Vritra or Varuna or Kuvera! thou alone walkest
in the wake of thy yet mightier father. As mental anguish doth not dog
one that hath controlled his senses,--the celestials cannot cope in
conflict with thee alone, O repressor of foes, O of mighty arms, bearing
thy dart in thy hand. O thou of high intelligence, put forth thy
prowess! and do thou also witness my work. It is only by virtue of the
boon he hath received, that thy uncle can bear the deities and the
Danavas. But Kumbhakarna copeth with the immortals and Asuras by means
of his native might. And in the bow equal to Indrajit himself and in
power equal to Ravana, thou now in might and energy art the foremost of
Rakshasas. And to-day let all creatures witness the mighty and wonderful
encounter in conflict between thee and me, like unto the meeting of
Sakra and Samvara. And unparalleled is the feat thou hast performed; and
thou hast displayed thy skill in weapons. And heroic monkeys endowed
with dreadful vigor, have been brought down by thee. And, O hero it is
only because of the apprehension[321] of censure of the people that I do
not slay thee who art fatigued in consequence of the acts that thou hast
performed. And reposing from fight, do thou see my strength!" And being
thus honored (by Sugriva) with fair speech, (Kumbha) flamed up like a
flame into which oblations have been poured. And then Kumbha seized
Sugriva by the arms. And like two elephants in rut, they sighing
momentarily, fastened on each other's person, and possessed each
other,--and from fatigue emitting from their mouth flames mixed with
vapour And with the stamping of their feet, the earth was rent into
rivers, and the main was waxed, with its billows surging furiously. Then
Sugriva lifting up Kumbha clean, violently plunged him into the salt
wash, making his eyes acquainted with the locality of the deep. And in
consequence of Kumbha's plunge, the waters heaving up, rolled on all
sides like the Vindhya or Mandara. Then springing up, and bringing
Sugriva down, Kumbha, transported with wrath dealt a blow on his chest,
like unto the levin. And thereat his skin was rent, and blood began to
gush out,--and the impetus of that blow broke Sugriva's bones. And the
vehemence (of the blow) caused a great fire to blaze up at that spot;
even as the thunder-bolt smiting the mountain Meru, maketh place blazed.
And the mighty Sugriva--foremost of monkeys--sorely handled by him,
fastened his fingers into a box resembling the thunder-bolt, and
furnished with all the effulgence of the solar disc having a thousand
rays. And then that powerful one made that blow descend right on
Kumbha's breast. And agonised with that stroke, Kumbha reft of his
senses, dropped like unto a fire that hath lost its brightness. And
overpowered by that blow, the Rakshasa anon dropped down, like unto the
bright Lohitanga dropping from the firmament urged on by Destiny. And
the aspect of the falling Kumbha with his breast broken by the blow,
appeared like that of the Sun routed by Rudra. And on his being slain,
in encounter, by the foremost of monkeys endowed with terrific strength,
the earth with her hills and woods, shook; and a mighty fear took
possession of the Rakshas.

Seeing his brother slain by Sugriva, Nikumbha, gazed at the lord of the
monkeys, as if consuming him with his passion. And then that one endowed
with calmness, grasped a bludgeon entwined with wreaths, and furnished
with an iron ring measuring five fingers, and resembling the top of the
Mahendra;[322] plated with gold and embellished with diamonds and
lapises,--and looking like the rod of Yama himself; dreadful, and
capable of removing the fear of the Rakshas. And whirling this, that
highly powerful one, resembling the banner itself of Sakra in energy,
Nikumbha possessed of terrific strength, with his mouth wide open, set
up shouts. And with gold adorning his breast, and _angadas_ placed on
his arms and a pair of curious and variegated earrings, Nikumbha, with
his ornaments and that same bludgeon, appeared beautiful like a mass of
roaring clouds laughing with lightning and furnished with the iris. And
the head of that huge-bodied hero's _parigha_ undid the conjunction of
the Seven[323] Winds and appeared[324] like a noiseless and smokeless
flame. Along with the gyration of Nikumbha's _parigha_ the whole welkin,
together with the excellent city[325] of the Gandharbas, and the
planets, stars and the moon, began to whirl. And Nikumbha was hard to
approach like unto the fire of dissolution, being resplendent with the
brilliance of _parigha_ and other ornaments and having his anger for its
fuels. And the Rakshasas and monkeys did not dare stir even out of fear.
And the heroic Hanuman, spreading his breast, stood before him. And
thereat the powerful (Nikumbha) having long-arms[326] threw his
_parigha_ resembling the Sun at the breast of that powerful one. And
falling on the firm and spacious breast of Hanuman it was broken into
hundred pieces. And the broken portions, being scattered, appeared like
hundreds of fire-brands in the sky. Like unto a mountain standing still
even at the time of an earthquake that mighty monkey was not moved
albeit struck with the _parigha_. Being thus hurt that highly powerful
Hanuman, the foremost of the monkeys, with great velocity clenched his
fist. And with this, the powerful (monkey) gifted with great
impetuosity, and resembling the wind in prowess, struck Nikumbha on his
breast. And with that fist, his (Nikumbha's) armour[327] was riven and
blood gushed out. And a light rising out of his breast suddenly
disappeared like unto lightning disappearing in a mass of clouds. And
being struck with his (Hanuman's) fist Nikumbha was greatly moved and
restoring himself attacked the mighty Hanuman and pulled him up. And
beholding in conflict the terrible and powerful Hanuman pulled up by
Nikumbha, the residents of Lanka began to shout with joy. Being thus put
to shame by that Raksha, Hanuman the son of the Wind, struck him with
his iron fist. And releasing himself from the grasp of Nikumbha, Hanuman
the Wind-god's son instantly planted his foot on the earth. Inflamed
with ire, he, throwing down Nikumbha, began to crush him; and gifted
with vehemence, he, with great impetuosity, leaped up and sat on the
breast (of the Raksha). And holding his head with two hands, he,
emitting loud roars, displaced his head. Nikumbha being thus slain in
conflict by the Wind-god's son, there ensued a terrible conflict between
the highly enraged armies of the son of Dacaratha and the lord of
Rakshasas. And Nikumbha being deprived of his life, the monkeys began to
shout--as if resounding all the quarters. And with it the whole earth
moved and the abode of the celestials dropped down. And the
Rakshasa-hosts were greatly terrified.

Beholding Kumbha and Nikumbha slain, Ravana was excited with ire like
unto flaming fire. And being beside himself, simultaneously with wrath
and grief Ravana[328] spoke unto Makaraksha, Khara's son, having
spacious eyes, saying--"O child, do thou proceed at my command with the
army and destroy Raghava and Lakshmana with all the monkeys". Hearing
the words of Ravana, Khara's son, Makaraksha, proud of his own prowess,
delightedly spoke unto the night-ranger, saying, "Be it so". And
saluting and circumambulating the Ten-necked one, that hero, at Ravana's
behest, issued out of the house. And Khara's son spoke unto the
commander who was near him, saying,--"Do thou speedily bring the chariot
here and all the soldiers". And hearing his words, that commanding
night-ranger, soon led before him the army and the chariot. And going
round the chariot and addressing the charioteer that night-ranger
(Makaraksha) said,--"O charioteer, do thou soon drive the chariot". And
Makaraksha addressed those Rakshasas, saying,--"O Rakshasas! do ye all
fight before me. I have been commanded by the high-souled Ravana, the
lord of Rakshasas, to slay both Rama and Lakshmana in conflict. I shall
slay to-day, O night-ranger, with my excellent arrows, Rama, Lakshmana,
Sugriva and all other monkeys. Like unto fire consuming dry fuel, shall
I to-day slay the host of monkeys with my darts". Hearing those words of
Makaraksha, the mighty night-rangers, (addressed themselves for fight).
They were armed with various weapons, cautious; assuming shapes at will,
crooked, having fearful teeth, coppery eyes; roaring like elephants,
having dishevelled hair and terrible. And encircling the huge-bodied son
of Khara, those gigantic (Rakshasas) began to proceed, delighted and
moving the earth (with the weight of their persons). There arose a
terrible noise on all sides from the sound of conches, and thousands of
bugles, and from the moving of the arms of the heroes. And all on a
sudden the reins slipped off (the hands of) the charioteer and the flag
of the Rakshasas dropped down. And the course of the steeds was thus
slackend and they began to move slowly and poorly with their heads
drooping down. There blew a terribly rough wind mixed with dust when the
fearfully wicked-minded Makarakshas issued out for battle. Those
powerful Rakshasas neglecting those bad omens proceeded towards where
Rama and Lakshmana were. They were all black like unto clouds, elephants
and buffaloes, and had marks of swords and maces on their persons. And
all those night rangers were skilled in the art of warfare and began to
range to and fro (in the battle field) saying, "I shall go first".

SECTION LXXIX.


Beholding Makaraksha out for battle, those foremost monkeys, leaping on
a sudden, addressed themselves for fight. Thereupon ensued a terrible
conflict, capable of making one's down stand on end, between the
night-rangers and the monkeys like unto one between the celestials and
Danavas. And those monkeys and night-rangers crushed each other down
with trees, darts, maces and _parighas_. And those night-rangers began
to assail those foremost of monkeys with _sakti_,[329] swords, maces,
_kuntas_, _tomaras_, _patticas_, _Vindipalas_,[330] arrows, nooses and
clubs. Being thus assailed with fearful arrows by Khara's son, those
monkeys, stricken with fear, fled away. And beholding the monkeys fly
away, the victorious Rakshasas began to roar like excited lions. The
monkeys thus flying away to all quarters, Rama with a downpour of shafts
assailed the Rakshasas. And beholding the Rakshasas thus overpowered,
the night ranger Makaraksha, excited with the flame of ire,
said,--"Stay, O Rama, let us both fight with each other; I shall take
thy life with sharp arrows discharged off my bow. Thou didst slay my
father in the forest of Dandaka. Remembering thy action and finding thee
before, my ire is excited. O Raghava! Vicious souled one! My limbs are
being burnt (with wrath) for I did not see thee then in that mighty
forest. O Rama, by my good luck, I have got thee to-day, like unto a
hungry lion desiring to have other animals. Being despatched by my
arrows to the world of devils, thou shalt live with those heroes, who
had been killed by thee before. What is the use of speaking more, O
Rama, do thou hear my words. Let all the people behold thy as well as my
prowess in the battlefield. Either with weapon or with clubs, in
whatever thou art expert, do thou fight with me in the battle-field, O
Rama". Hearing the words of Makaraksha, Rama, Dacaratha's son, smiling,
replied to the words of the babbler. "O Raksha, what is the use of idle
prating? None can achieve success in battle with idle words--but with
fighting. I slew in the forest of Dandaka thy father with fourteen
thousand Rakshasas, Tricira and Dushana. O vile one, thou being slain to
day, with thy flesh, vultures and crows, having sharp beaks and nails,
and jackals shall be satisfied.[331] Being thus addressed by Raghava,
the mighty Makaraksha, began to dart sharp arrows towards him in the
battle-field. And Rama, with his shafts, sundered into several pieces,
those arrows. And being thus rendered useless those arrows, feathered in
gold, fell down on the earth. Then there arose a terrible conflict
between the Rakshasa Khara's son and Dacaratha's son. And there were
audible in that battle-field, the outcry of the heroes and the twang of
the bows stretched by their hands, like unto the muttering of the clouds
in the sky. And to beheld that wondrous conflict, the celestials,
Danavas, Gandharbas, Kinnaras and the mighty serpents stationed
themselves in the sky. They were wounded with the arrows discharged by
each other and their strength was doubled. And they began to fight in
that battle-field one attacking and the other withstanding the attack.
And in that conflict the Rakshasa sundered the shafts discharged by
Rama. And likewise Rama severed into several pieces the arrows shot by
the Rakshasa. All the quarters were covered with arrows and nothing on
earth or in the sky was visible. Thereupon being excited with ire,
Raghava of long arms sundered his (Rakshasa's) bow in conflict and with
eight _Narachas_ pierced the charioteer. And with arrows Rama sundered
the chariot and killing the horses brought them down. And the
night-ranger Makaraksha was brought down on the earth from the chariot.
He then again rose up with a dart in his hand creating terror unto all
creatures and resembling the Fire of Dissolution in resplendence. It was
a terribly huge dart conferred on him by Siva, shining in the sky in its
native brilliance and like unto another weapon of destruction.[332] And
beholding which dart even the celestials fly away in fear to different
quarters. And taking up that huge flaming dart, the night-ranger, being
excited with ire, hurled it at the high-souled Raghava. And Raghava,
with four shafts, sundered that dart, in the sky, flaming and hurled at
him by the son of Khara. And that flaming dart, feathered in gold, being
splintered into several pieces by Rama's arrows fell down on earth like
a huge fire-brand. And beholding that dart baffled thus by Rama of
unwearied actions all those, stationed in the welkin began to shout,
"Well done! Well done!!" And beholding his dart thus sundered, the
night-ranger Makaraksha clenching his fist spoke unto Kakutstha, saying,
"Stay! Stay!" And seeing him advance thus, the descendant of Raghu,
smiling, fixed a fiery arrow on his bow. And with that arrow the Raksha
was slain by Kakutstha in battle. And having his heart pierced he fell
down and died. And beholding Makaraksha thus slain all the Rakshasas,
being afraid of Rama's arrows, proceeded towards Lanka. And seeing that
night-ranger, the son of Khara, slain by Rama's arrows, like unto a
mountain clept by a thunder-bolt, the celestials were greatly delighted.

SECTION LXXX.


Hearing of the destruction of Makaraksha, the heroic Ravana, being
excited with ire, began to grind his teeth. Being thus angered, and
thinking within himself what steps to take, he ordered his son Indrajit
to proceed to the battle-field. "O hero, gifted with great prowess as
thou art, do thou, hidden (in clouds) or appearing before them, slay the
two heroic brothers Rama and Lakshmana. Thou didst defeat in conflict
Indra of unequalled prowess. Shalt thou then neglect to slay men as they
are?" Being thus addressed by the lord of the Rakshasas and obeying his
father's command, Indrajit proceeded towards the sacrificial ground to
satisfy Fire (with oblations). There came some she-demons with crimson
turbans and waited respectfully where Ravana's son was offering
oblations unto Fire. In that sacrifice the weapons were the leaves of
_sara_,[333] _bibhutaks_[334] were fuels, and there were brought crimson
clothes and _sruvas_[335] made of black iron. And spreading fire on all
sides with _sara_ leaves and _tomaras_, (Indrajit) caught a living goat,
all black, by the neck. And the fire, with oblations of _sara_, became
greatly blazed and devoid of smoke. And there were visible many good
omens indicating victory. The flame of the fire was like unto gold, and
moving Southwards began to receive offerings of clarified butter. And
thus offering oblations unto fire and unto celestials, Danavas and
Rakshasas, he ascended an excellent car and soon disappeared. It was
drawn by four horses and a huge bow, set with sharp arrows, appeared
beautiful on that excellent car. The chariot was brilliant with its own
native resplendence, adorned with gold and painted with the figures of
deer and a cresent. It was encircled on all sides with golden bracelets,
adorned with flags made of _vaidurja_ and was like unto the flaming
fire. And being thus well protected with Brahma weapons resembling the
Sun in brilliance, the mighty son of Ravana became invincible. And
offering oblations unto Fire in accordance with demonaic incantations
and thus obtaining the power of hiding himself, that hero, ever
victorious in battle, issued out of the city and said,--"Slaying these
two brothers in battle, who have uselessly wandered away into the
forest, shall I crown my father Ravana with victory. Destroying Rama and
Lakshmana, and clearing the monkeys off the earth, shall I satisfy my
sire greatly". Saying this, he disappeared from their view. Thereupon
that fearful foe of the lord of celestials appeared in the battle-field,
excited with wrath, armed with bow and sharp Narachas and commissioned
thus by the Ten-necked one. He beheld there those two heroes discharging
flaming arrows and surrounded by the monkeys like unto the fearful
three-hooded serpent in the midst of other serpents. And thinking "these
must be Rama and Lakshmana," and stretching his bow he began showering
arrows like unto clouds. He was seated in a car in the welkin and hidden
from the human gaze and began to assail Rama and Lakshmana with sharp
shafts. And being hurt with the arrows, Rama and Lakshmana, fixing
arrows on their bows, began to discharge celestial shafts. And those two
highly powerful heroes could not even touch his person with their arrows
resembling the Sun albeit they covered the whole welkin therewith. And
clouding the whole sky with smoke that effulgent one, enveloped in
frost, hid himself from their gaze. There was not audible the twang of
his bow, the sound of the wheels, or the noise of the steeds. Nor was he
seen by any. In that terrible darkness of clouds that one of mighty arms
began to make a downpour of Narachas and arrows like hail storms. And in
that encounter, Ravana's son, inflamed with ire, wounded Rama, with
shafts, resembling the Sun and obtained by him as a boon. And being hurt
with Narachas, like unto mountains wet with rain, those two foremost of
men, began to discharge shafts feathered in gold. And reaching the son
of Ravana in the sky and soaked in blood those golden arrows, fell down
on earth. And those two best of men, hurt with his arrows, became more
effulgent and baffled the shafts discharged by the Rakshasa. Thereupon
Rama and Lakshmana began to aim their sharp shafts to the direction
whence the arrows came down. And stationed in his chariot that mighty
car-warrior disturbed all quarters with his arrows and pierced
Dacaratha's sons with sharp shafts won by him. And being greatly hurt
with those sharp-pointed and terrible arrows Rama and Lakshmana appeared
like blossoming _kingsukas_. Like unto the sun hidden in clouds they
could see neither his countenance and motion, nor his bow and arrows.
And being wounded with those arrows hundreds of monkeys died and fell
down on the earth. Thereupon Lakshmana, being excited with wrath, spoke
unto his brother, saying--"To slay all the Rakshasas shall I discharge
to-day Brahma weapon". Thereupon Rama spoke unto Lakshmana, gifted with
auspicious marks, saying--"It doth not behove thee to clear all the
Rakshasas off the earth for the folly of one individual. Thou shouldst
not slay him, who hath retired from battle, hath hidden himself, hath
sought thy shelter, hath stood before thee with joined palms, hath fled
away or who is bewildered. O thou of mighty-arms, let us try to slay him
(Indrajit). And to accomplish it I shall use the weapons gifted with
great impetuosity and resembling the serpents. He is hidden from the
public gaze so we must slay him--had he been fighting openly the leaders
of the monkey hosts could have slain that Rakshasa. Truly he shall be
burnt to death with my shafts and fall down on the earth albeit he
entereth the regions under the earth or the abode of the celestials".
Having said these words pregnant with a high significance, the
high-souled and heroic descendant of Raghu, being surrounded by monkeys,
began to concert various plans for the destruction of that terrible
Rakshasa of wicked deeds.

SECTION LXXXI.


Having read the intention of that high-souled Raghava, he retired from
the battle-field and entered into the city of Lanka. And remembering the
destruction of many a quick-paced Rakshasa, his eyes were rendered
coppery with ire; and that hero, the son of Ravana, issued out of the
city again. And that highly powerful, Indrajit, a descendant of Pulasta
and an enemy of the celestials, issued out, encircled by the Rakshasas,
by the western gate. And beholding the heroic brothers Rama and
Lakshmana prepared for fight, Indrajit spread illusions. And placing an
illusory figure of Sita on the car, encircled by a huge army he began to
make arrangements for her destruction. And desiring to charm all with
his illusions, that one of wicked intent, preparing himself to slay
Sita, proceeded towards the monkeys. And beholding him thus proceed, the
monkeys, inflamed with ire, desirous of fighting and with crags in their
hands, moved on, And preceded them all, Hanuman, the foremost of the
monkeys, with a huge mountain-top in his hand. He beheld there, on
Indrajit's car, Sita, deprived of all joy, poorly, greatly reduced with
fasts and wearing a single braid. And Raghava's beloved spouse wore a
piece of soiled cloth, and though highly beautiful, the grace of her
person was greatly spoiled with dirt. That daughter of Janaka, was not
seen by him for a long time. And beholding her and deciding instantly
that she is the daughter of Mithila, (he became greatly sorry). And
seeing her on the car, innocent, poor, deprived of joy and brought under
the influence of the son of the lord of Rakshasas that great monkey
thought within himself--'What must be the intention of Indrajit?' and
accompanied by heroic monkeys advanced towards the son of Ravana. And
beholding that monkey host, Ravana's son became beside himself with ire
and unsheathing his weapon _Nistrinsha_, caught her by the hair. And
that Rakshasa addressed himself to strike her in the presence of all
those monkeys, and that illusory figure of Sita began to bewail saying,
"O Rama! O Rama!" And seeing her thus caught by the head, Hanuman, the
son of Maruta, greatly sorry, began to shed tears. And beholding that
beloved spouse of Rama, having a tender and beautiful person, he
addressed angrily the son of the lord of Rakshasas with harsh words. "It
is for thy destruction, O Vicious-souled one! that thou hast touched her
hair. Being descended from that great Brahma ascetic thou art born as a
Rakshasa. O! cursed art thou, since thou hast cherished such a desire
and engaged in such a vicious deed. O vile! O wicked! O cruel and
dishonorable wight! O thou having vice for thy prowess! O shameless! Art
thou not ashamed of perpetrating such an inhuman deed. What hath
Maithili done by thee, O cruel one! that thou art ready to slay her--She
hath been banished from her home, territory and hath been separated from
her lord. O thou worthy of being slain, destroying Sita, thou shalt not
live long as thou hast been brought under me. Thou shalt after the death
reach the place which is occupied by those who murder women--a place
which is avoided even by those who commit every sort of crime punishable
by law". Saying this Hanuman, accompanied by monkeys armed with weapons,
and excited with ire, proceeded towards the son of the lord of
Rakshasas. Beholding the highly powerful monkeys advance thus the
Rakshasas, inflamed with wrath, obstructed them. And assailing the
monkey-hosts with thousands of arrows, Indrajit spoke unto that foremost
of monkeys, Hanuman, saying,--"To-day I shall slay before you all
Vaidehi, for whom thou, Sugriva and Rama have come. Slaying her, O
monkey, I shall afterwards kill thee, Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva and
the dishonorable Bibhisana. And, O monkey, about not destroying women,
of which thou wert speaking (I might say) that we must always do what
pains our enemies".[336] Saying this, Indrajit with a sharp sword,
himself killed the illusory Sita thus bewailing. And being sundered by
him obliquely in a way in which a sacred thread lies on one's own
person, the innocent (Sita) having a beautiful countenance fell down on
the earth. And slaying her Indrajit spoke unto Hanuman, saying,--"Behold
I have slain (before thee) with my sword Rama's beloved. And Vaidehi
being thus slain, all your labours have been rendered useless". And
destroying her with his own hand by means of a huge sword, Indrajit,
greatly pleased ascended his car and began to emit dreadful roars. And
the monkeys stationed near heard that terrible roar and saw him enter
the castle.[337] And slaying Sita[338] that wicked-minded son of Ravana
became greatly pleased. And beholding him thus delighted the monkeys
being greatly sorry fled away.

[336] There is one sloka intervening according to some texts--but it has
      been omitted by many. The reasons for this omission are best known
      to them. The purport is:--"Why did Rama slay Taraka before? And I
      shall therefore slay his spouse the daughter of king Janaka".

      that Rama is equally blameable for this.--T.

SECTION LXXXII.


Hearing that dreadful uproar resembling the sound of Indra's
thunder-bolt, the monkeys, casting their looks on all sides fled away.
Thereupon Hanuman, the son of Maruta, spoke unto them, poorly, terrified
and of a sorrowful countenance, saying,--"O monkeys, why do ye look so
melancholy and why are you flying away? Why have ye renounced your
earnest desire for fight? And where is your heroism gone? Do ye remain
behind me, I shall go first in the battle". Being thus addressed by that
highly intelligent son of the Wind-god, they were greatly excited with
wrath and being pleased took up trees and crags in their hands. And
roaring thus the leading monkeys advanced towards the Rakshasas and
stood encircling Hanuman in the battle-field. And being surrounded on
all sides by leading monkeys, Hanuman began to burn down enemy's host
like unto fire spreading its flames. And being encircled by monkey-hosts
that mighty monkey resembling Death himself began to grind the
Rakshasas. And being overwhelmed with grief and wrought up with ire,
that monkey Hanuman, threw a huge crag on the car of that son of Ravana.
Beholding that crag about to fall down on the car, the charioteer moved
his horses and it was speedily brought at some distance. And not
reaching Indrajit stationed on the car and the charioteer, that crag,
uselessly hurled, fell down on the earth. And that crag falling down
many of the Rakshasas were crushed. Thereupon hundreds of huge-bodied
monkeys, emitting cries and taking up crags and trees proceeded towards
him (Indrajit) and hurled them at him. And the monkeys gifted with
dreadful prowess began to make a down-pour of crags and trees. They thus
assailed the enemies and frequently emitted cries. And the grim-visaged
night-rangers were thus assailed with trees in that field by the
terrible monkeys. Beholding his army thus distressed by the monkeys,
Indrajit, excited with wrath, and taking up his dart, proceeded towards
the enemies, and encircled by his soldiers showered terrible shafts upon
them. And that one of dreadful prowess slew many a leading monkey by
means of darts, Acanis, swords, _patticas_ and clubs. And the highly
powerful monkeys destroyed his retinue, with crags, stones and trees
having strong trunks. And Hanuman thus crushed many a Rakshasa of
terrible deeds. Obstructing the Rakshasas (for some time) Hanuman spoke
unto monkeys, saying,--"Stay, we should not fight now. That daughter of
Janaka hath been slain, for whom we have engaged in fight, renouncing
all hope of life and desiring to accomplish Rama's satisfaction. Let us
now go and inform Rama and Sugriva of it. And we shall do as we shall be
commanded by them. Saying this and desisting all the monkeys from
encounter that foremost of monkeys proceeded undaunted and heroically.
And beholding Hanuman proceed thus where Raghava was that wicked-minded
one (Indrajit) with a view to offer oblations unto Fire entered the
sacrificial altar _Nikumbhila_. And reaching there Indrajit lighted up
fire and began to pour oblations therein. And the Fire blazed up
receiving oblations of blood, and being satisfied assumed the appearance
of the setting sun. And Indrajit conversant with all ceremonials,
offered oblations in due form for the welfare of the Rakshasas. And they
all stood there watching the result and desirous of ascertaining the
success of the battle.[339]

[339] This sloka hath been left off in some editions.--T.



SECTION LXXXIII.


Hearing the terrible war-cry of the Rakshasas and monkeys Raghava spoke
unto Jambavan, saying:--"O gentle one, forsooth hath Hanuman performed
some mighty act--for I hear the dreadful sound of the weapons. Do thou
therefore proceed speedily, O lord of bears, with all thy soldiers to
assist that foremost of monkeys.

Thereupon, saying, 'So be it,' that king of bears, surrounded by his
forces, approached the Western gate, where the monkey, Hanuman, was
stationed. And then the lord of bears saw Hanuman approach, surrounded
by monkeys sighing hard, who had faught the fight. And seeing on the way
that host of bears dreadful and resembling dark clouds, on the march,
Hanuman made them desist. And that illustrious one along with that
force, speedily presented himself (before Rama), and with a heavy heart
addressed him, saying--"As we were fighting in the field, Ravana's son,
Indrajit in our very sight slew Sita, crying (in distress). O subduer of
enemies, seeing her (in this plight) I, with my senses bewildered, have
been overwhelmed with grief. Therefore I have come unto thee to inform
thee of what hath befallen". Hearing these words of his, Raghava,
overwhelmed with grief, dropped down to the earth, like a tree whose
roots have been severed. Seeing the god-like Raghava down on the earth,
the foremost monkeys from all sides rushed forward and came to where (he
was). And with water scented with lotuses,[340] they fell to sprinkling
that one resembling a furious fire[341] that hath suddenly arisen.
Thereat Lakshmana overcome with sorrow, embracing Rama, spoke unto him
words fraught with reason and import,--"Profitless[342] virtue is
incapable, O noble one, of delivering from calamaties thee, who hast
subdued thy senses, and who ever abidest in the good path. Beings and
the mobile as well as the immobile cannot have that direct perception of
virtue which they have of happiness. Therefore, I ween, virtue is a
non-entity. Inasmuch as the mobile (albeit devoid of any regard for
virtue) are nevertheless happy, and as the mobile also are so, this
virtue cannot lead to happiness. (If it were so), one like thee would
have not been placed in peril. If unrighteousness would bring
unhappiness on creatures, Ravana should hence to hell, and thou
possessed of virtue, shouldst not come by misfortune. And seeing that he
is free from danger, and thou art in it, righteousness and its opposite
are found to have tendencies the very reverse of those assigned to them
respectively (by the Vedas). And if by means of virtue, one attaineth
the felicity attached to it, and by means of unrighteouness, one reapeth
its proper fruit, then let those that are unrighteous reap the fruit of
their impiety,--nor let those that set their face against sin, be
deprived of the fruit of their righteousness; and let those that walk in
the way of virtue reap the fruit of their piety. But as prosperity
attendeth those that are established in un-righteousness, and as those
regardful of righteousness fare lamentably,--these[343] have not the
senses assigned to them (by the scriptures). If, O Raghava, (it is
contended that) unrighteousness cutteth off the wicked, then whom shall
unrighteousness, himself slain by the act of slaughter of the
destroyer,--slay in his turn? Or if it is said that one is slain or
slayeth another by ordinance, then it is Destiny, which is touched by
the sinful act and not he. O chastiser of foes, incapable of meting out
retribution,[344]--unmanifest itself, and non-existent, how can virtue,
even if we grant its existence, find out the person that should be
slain? If, O foremost of the good, it had existed, thou wouldst not have
come by any misfortune. But inasmuch as thou hast fallen into this
plight, there is no such thing as virtue. Or itself feeble and impotent,
it taketh refuge in manliness. And being powerless and bereft of
dignity, it should, I deem, by no means be followed. And if virtue is a
property of manliness, then carefully forsaking virtue, do thou follow
strength as thou hast hitherto followed virtue. But, O subduer of
enemies, if truthfulness be virtue, art thou not bound by that departing
from which the king lost his life?[345] And, O chastiser of foes, if
virtue must be practised above all, or if prowess must have
precedence,--then the thunder-handed Satakratu would not have celebrated
his sacrifice, slaying the ascetic.[346] O Raghava, virtue aided by
prowess, destroyeth enemies. Therefore, O Kakutstha, people, for
compassing their ends, resort to both virtue and prowess. This, sire, is
my opinion: this, O Raghava, is virtue. But thou, having then renounced
the kingdom, hast laid the axe at the root[347] of righteousness. Like
streams issuing out mountains, all acts spring from wealth flowing from
various regions and attaining magnitude. Like a shrunken stream in
summer, all the acts of that foolish person who hath been divorced by
wealth, are annihilated.--He that renouncing riches within his
reach,[348] hankers after enjoyment,--being carried away by his
overmastering desire, taketh to getting at wealth by sinful acts; and
then he incurreth guilt. Unto him that hath wealth are friends, unto him
that hath wealth are acquaintances,--he that hath wealth is an
individuality in this world, and he that hath wealth is a learned
person. He that hath wealth is powerful; he that hath wealth is
intelligent; he that hath wealth is mighty-armed; and he that hath
wealth is full of all graces. All these that I have ennumerated are the
evils of forsaking fortune. (I cannot divine) what made thee, renouncing
the monarchy, to adopt such a course.--He that hath riches, hath virtue
and desire attending on him, and hath everything auspicious. That one
without wealth, that seeketh it, cannot secure the wealth of prowess,
without riches and desire. And, O lord of men, cheerfulness, and desire,
and pride, and piety, and anger, and self-restraint, and
self-control--all these come from wealth. As the planets are not
discovered on a stormy day, that wealth, the want of which renders this
world naught even unto the ascetics practising righteousness,--is not
visible in thee. O hero, thou having abode by the words of thy superior
and having come (to the forest), thy wife dearer then life itself hath
been ravished by Rakshas. But, O hero, to-day, O Raghava, by my acts
will I remove this huge sorrow that hath been heaped upon us by
Indrajit. Therefore, rise thou up. Rise up, O foremost of men, O
long-armed one, O thou who observest vows. Why dost thou not understand
thyself as the Supreme Soul?[349] And, O sinless one, urged on behalf of
thy welfare, I, waxing wroth on hearing of the slaughter of Janaka's
daughter, shall with my shafts entirely raze to the ground Lanka with
cars and elephants and steeds and the foremost Rakshas".

As Lakshmana devoted to his brother was comforting Rama, Bibhishana,
posting his forces at their proper quarters, came there, surrounded by
four heroes accoutred in various arms, resembling masses of collyrium or
leaders of elephant-herds. And approaching the high-souled Raghava,
overwhelmed with grief, he saw the monkeys with tears in their eyes. And
he saw that joy of the Ikshwaku race--the high-souled Raghava--stupified
with grief, lying on the lap of Lakshmana. And seeing Rama cast down and
inflamed with grief, Bibhishana, inly pained, said,--'What is this?'
Thereat, gazing at Bibhishana's countenance as well as all those
monkeys, Lakshmana, with his eyes flooded with tears, said these words
pregnant with dire import,--"O placid one, hearing from Hanuman's lips
that Sita hath been slain by Indrajit, Raghava hath been overcome with
stupor". As Sumitra's son was speaking thus, Bibhishana, preventing him,
addressed the stupified Rama in these pregnant words,--"O king, all that
Hanuman in distressful guise had communicated unto thee I deem as
improbable, like unto the drying of the deep. I know the intent of the
impious Ravana with reference to Sita, O mighty-armed one. Her he will
not slay. I, seeking his welfare, had besought him much, saying,--'Let
go Vaidehi',--but he did not act up to my speech. Neither by
conciliation, nor by gift, nor by dissension,--and where is war?--nor by
any other means is one capable of obtaining the very sight of Sita.
Having bewildered the monkeys, the Rakshasa hath gone back; and, O
mighty-armed one, know her to be the illusory daughter of Janaka.
To-day, going to the sacrificial ground (called) Nikumbhila, he will
offer oblations into fire; and there the deity of fire will present
himself along with Vasava and the (other) divinities. And then Ravana's
son shall be invincible in battle. Indubitably that illusion hath been
wrought by him, to deceive (the monkeys), so that they might not through
their prowess disturb him there. Thither will we go before he hath
furnished his (sacrifice). O foremost of men, shake off this vain sorrow
that hath overcome thee! Seeing thee smitten with grief, this entire
host is dispirited. Here, with thy heart composed, do thou stay,
summoning thy strength. Send Lakshmana along with us and the flower of
the forces. This foremost of men by means of sharpened shafts will make
Ravana's son give up his rites; and then shall he be capable of being
slain by us. These keen and sharpened shafts of his, attaining access of
velocity through the feathers of birds, and themselves resembling fierce
fowls, will drink his[350] blood. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, do thou
in order to the destruction of the Rakshasa, commission Lakshmana, even
as the wielder of the thunder-bolt commandeth the same. And as to-day no
time should be lost, therefore do thou send Lakshmana for compassing the
destruction of the foe, even as Mahendra sendeth the thunder-bolt for
bringing about the destruction of the enemies of the immortals. If that
foremost of Rakshasas can finish his rites, he shall be invisible to
both celestials and Asuras; and, he fighting after finishing his
sacrifice, the celestials themselves shall be placed in great jeopardy".

Hearing his speech, Raghava, overwhelmed with grief, could not perfectly
comprehend what was said by the Rakshasa. Then, summoning up patience,
Rama--captor of hostile capitals--spoke unto Bibhishana, seated near the
monkeys,--"O lord of Nairitas, I once more wish to hear what, O
Bibhishana, thou hast said". Hearing Raghava's words, Bibhishana,
skilled in speech, again spoke these words, saying,--"O mighty-armed
one, I have stationed the forces, O hero, agreeably to thy directions.
The entire force hath been divided around; and the leaders have also
been placed properly. Further, O mighty master, listen to what I have to
say. On thy having been causelessly aggrieved, we all of us were seized
with grief. If this anxiety of thine conduceth to the joy of the enemy,
do thou cast it off. And, O hero, bestir thyself,--and summon up
spirits. If thou art to have Sita, and if the night-rangers are to be
slain by thee, do thou, O Raghu's son, listen to my profitable speech.
Let Sumitra's son go forth, environed by a mighty force, for slaying in
battle the son of Ravana, who hath gone to Nikumbhila; with shafts
resembling venomous serpents, discharged from the round[351] of his bow.
By virtue of his austerities, that hero, from a boon conferred by the
Self-sprung, hath obtained the Brahmaciras weapon, together with steeds
coursing at their will. Now he with his army hath gone to Nikumbhila;
and when, having finished his rites, he gets up, know that all of us are
slain. 'When not reaching Nikumbhila, and not having finished thy
offerings unto fire, thou, equipped with arms, art slain by a foe,--O
enemy of Indra, that is thy death.'--Thus, O mighty-armed one, did the
lord of all creatures confer a boon (on Indrajit), and, O king, thus was
the death of this intelligent one ordained. O Rama, for compassing the
destruction of Indrajit, do thou commission a mighty force. On his being
slain, know that Ravana along with his retainers are slain".--Hearing
Bibhishana's words, Rama said,--"O thou having truth for prowess, I know
the illusion of that fierce one. Without doubt, he is skilled in the
Brahma weapon, is potent in illusion and, is possessed of exceeding
strength. In conflict, he depriveth of consciousness even the celestials
with Varuna (at their head). And as that illustrious (one) goeth about
in the welkin on his chariot, none, O hero, can perceive his course,
like the course of the Sun when the sky is covered with clouds". And
Raghava, being well acquainted with the illusive energy of his
wicked-minded foe, addressed the renowned Lakshmana, saying,--"Environed
by the entire host of the lord of monkeys,--accompanied by the leaders,
O Lakshmana, headed by Hanuman,--with Jambavan~king of bears--and girt
round by the forces,--do thou slay this son of the Rakshasa, possessed
of the strength of illusion. And accompanied by his counsellors, this
high-souled night-ranger shall follow at thy back, in this engagement
with that one skilled in illusion". Hearing Raghava's words, Lakshmana
endowed with dreadful prowess, with Bibhishana,--took up another
excellent bow. And donning on his mail, and putting on his armour and
his sword, and furnished with arrows, and a bow in his left
hand,--Sumitra's son, touching Rama's feet, feeling elated, addressed
Rama, saying,--"To-day the shafts discharged from my bow, piercing
Ravana's son, shall fall into Lanka, even as swans drop into a tank.
This very day shall my arrows, shot from my redoubtable bow-string, rive
the body of that terrific one". Having spoken thus, the effulgent
Lakshmana, eager to slay Ravana's son, went before his brother. And
having saluted at the feet of his superior and went round him, Lakshmana
set out for the sacrificial ground (named) Nikumbhila, protected by the
son of Ravana. And accompanied by Bibhishana, that powerful son of the
king--Lakshmana--after his brother had offered up prayers in his
behalf,--set off with all speed. And surrounded by thousands of monkeys,
Hanuman as well as Bibhishana together with his counsellors--speedily
went in the wake of Lakshmana. And strongly encompassed by that mighty
monkey-host, (Lakshmana) saw the forces of the bear-king stationed on
the way. And having proceeded far, Sumitra's son--enhancer of the
delight of friends--from a distance discovered the forces of the
Rakshasa-monarch, drawn up in battle-array. And that subduer of
enemies--Raghu's son--bearing his bow in his hand, coming upon him whoso
martial might lay in illusion,--stopped (there) for conquering his foe
agreeably to the ordinance[352] of Brahma. And accompanied by
Bibhislnna, the heroic Angada, and the Wind-god's offspring, the
powerful son of the king dived into the forces of the foe, various,
blazing with burnished arms, dense with standards; And thronging with
mighty cars,[353] capable of striking terror (into the hearts of the
spectators), instinct with immeasurable energy, and resembling darkness.

[351] The bow drawn to its full stretch, becomes circular.--T.

[352] The ordinance was that Indrajit should be slain while remaining
      outside Nikumbhila, his rites not yet finished.--T.

SECTION LXXXVI.


When things were in this condition, Ravana's younger brother addressed
Lakshmana in words fraught with evil to foes and conducing to the
welfare (of his own party), saying,--"Do thou without delay bring on an
engagement between this cloud-black Rakshasa army, which thou beholdest,
and the monkeys having rocks for their arms. O Lakshmana, do thou exert
thyself to break through his[354] mighty army; and when the ranks are
broken, the son of the Rakshasa-lord shall be visible. And scattering
among the foes shafts resembling Indra's thunder-bolt, charge him while
he hath not yet finished this ceremony. Slay, O hero, this wicked one,
this son of Ravana, given to illusion, and of terrific feats,--the fear
of all the worlds". Hearing Bibhishana's words, Lakshmana graced with
auspicious marks began to shower arrows on the son of the
Rakshasa-chief. And bears and monkeys, given to fighting excellently
with trees, in a body rushed towards that army (of Rakshas) drawn up
there. And the Rakshasas (on their part) burning to slaughter the
monkey-forces, rushed in the encounter with sharpened shafts and darts
and _tomaras_. And there took place a tremendous onslaught of the
monkeys and the Rakshasas. And Lanka resounded all around with that
mighty tumult; and the sky was covered with weapons of various shapes,
and whetted arrows and trees and dreadful upraised mountain-tops. And
Rakshasas having frightful faces and arms, plying their arms among the
foremost monkeys, began to spread terror (there). And in the same way
the monkeys in the conflict fell to slaying and wounding the Rakshasas
with trees and hill-tops. And great was the terror that was spread among
the warring Rakshasas by the flower of the bears and monkeys, possessed
of gigantic persons and endowed with prodigious strength.

Hearing his own army hard beset by the enemies, and drooping,--the
unconquerable one, ere yet he had finished his rites, rose up. And
issuing from the gloom of the trees, Ravana's son, fired with wrath,
ascended his car, which had already been well yoked (with steeds). And
accoutred in a dreadful bow and arrows,--that one resembling a mass of
collyrium, having a red face and eyes, looked dreadful like the
Reaper--Death. And soon as they saw him mounted on his car, that host of
Rakshas possessed of dreadful impetuosity, eager to engage with
Lakshmana, stood on their ground. At this time that subduer of
enemies--Hanuman--resembling a mountain, uprooted a giant tree incapable
of being bandied. And in that encounter, the monkey, consuming (the
forces) like the fire risen at Doomsday, made that army of Rakshasas
insensible with innumerable trees. And finding the Wind-god's son,
Hanuman, suddenly spreading devastation among the Rakshasas by
thousands, (they) showered (shafts) on him. And approaching on all sides
that one resembling a hill, those bearing whetted darts attacked him
with darts; those bearing swords in their hands, with swords; those
bearing javelins in their hands, with javelins; with _patticas_, those
equipped with _patticas_; and with bludgeons, and maces and graceful
_kuntas_; and with hundreds of _sataghnis_, and iron clubs; and with
terrific axes; and with _bhindipalas_; and with boxes like unto
thunder-bolts; and slaps resembling the _acani_. And fired with fury, he
(on his part) spread a huge havoc among them. And Indrajit saw that
foremost of monkeys, resembling a hill, the offspring of the
Wind-god--possessing himself in calmness, while destroying his foes. And
thereat, he[355] addressed his charioteer, saying,--"Go where the monkey
is. Being disregarded by the Ratkshasas, he makes havoc among us". Thus
accosted by him, the charioteer went where the Wind-god's offspring was,
carrying the exceedingly invincible Indrajit seated on the car. And
rushing forward, that irrepressible one--the Rakshasa--began to shower
on the monkey's head arrows and swords and _patticas_ and scimitars and
axes. And bearing all those dreadful arms, the Wind-god's offspring,
overcome with a mighty rage said,--"O wicked-minded son of Ravana, if
thou art a hero, fight on. Combat with me with thy arms. If in the
encounter, thou bearest my impetus, then, O thou of perverse sense, thou
indeed art the foremost of Rakshasas". Then Bibhishana pointed out unto
Lakshmana the son of Ravana, who with his bow upraised, was eager to
slay Hanuman. "This one that, mounted on his car, is eager to slay
Hanuman, is the son of Ravana that hath vanquished Vasava himself (in
battle). Do thou, O son of Sumitra, with peerless shafts capable of
resisting enemies,--dreadful, and competent to finish the lives (of
foes),--slay the son of Ravana". Thus accosted by Bibhishana terrific
unto foes, that high-souled one saw (Indrajit) of dreadful prowess,
difficult to get at, and resembling a hill,--stationed on his car.

[354] Indrajit's, that is.

[355] Indrajit.



SECTION LXXXVI


Having spoken thus unto Sumitra's son, Bibhishana experienced delight,
and taking (Lakshmana) bearing a bow in his hand, hurriedly went off.
And proceeding some way and entering the mighty wood, Bibhishana pointed
out unto Lakshmana the (place of) sacrifice. And the energetic brother
of Ravana showed unto Lakshmana the Nyagrodha, dreadful to behold and
resembling a mass of sable clouds. "Here offering presents unto the
ghosts, the powerful son of Ravana afterwards engages in conflict. Then
the Rakshasa becomes invisible to all beings; and he slayeth his enemies
in battle and fastens them with excellent shafts. Do thou, ere he hath
passed beyond the Nyagrodha, with flaming arrows destroy the powerful
son of Ravana along with his car and steeds and charioteer". Thereupon
saying,--'So be it,' the exceedingly energetic son of Sumitra--that
delight of his friends--took up his post there, stretching his
variegated bow. And Ravana's son Indrajit, endowed with strength,
mailed, and armed with a sword, and furnished with a banner, was seen
mounted on a fire-hued chariot. And the highly powerful Lakshmana
addressed Pulastya's son, never knowing defeat, saying,--"I challenge
thee to the encounter. Do thou give me battle, exerting thy utmost".
Thus addressed, the exceedingly energetic and intelligent son of Ravana,
seeing Bibhishana there, spoke anto him harshly, thus,--"Born and bred
in this (Rakshasa race), thou art the very brother of my father. Why, O
Rakshasa, being my uncle, dost thou range thyself against thy son? But
neither kinship, nor emity, nor race, O wicked-minded one, nor co-birth,
can, O destroyer of righteousness, avail to make thee discern thy duty.
O thou of perverse understanding, thou art indeed to be pitied; as thou
art worthy of being reproached by the virtuous; since, renouncing thine
own, thou hast espoused servitude under another. Neither by thy
character nor yet thy understanding dost thou perceive the mighty
difference that lieth between living with one's own kindred, and taking
refuge with the base. If one that is not our own, be furnished with
every grace, and if one's own be void of all merit,--one's kindred,
albeit unworthy, is preferable; and he that is not ours, is even always
such. He that, forsaking his own party, serveth that of another, is
destroyed even by the latter, when his own party is destroyed. O
night-ranger, such is this thy relentlessness, that, O Ravana's younger
brother, thou being a kindred, art capable of displaying thy manliness
(as no other person can do so)". Thus addressed by his brother's son,
Bibhishana answered,--"O Rakshasa, why dost thou speak as if in
ignorance of my character? O impious son of the Rakshasa-chief, do thou
forego the roughness which thou assumest on behalf of my dignity.[356]
Albeit born in the race of Rakshas of cruel deeds, yet having regard to
the first of principles pertaining to men, my character is not that of a
Rakshasa. I do not take pleasure in the terrible; nor do I revel in
unrighteousness. But how can a brother, although differing from his
brother in character, be renounced by the latter?[357] One renouncing a
person, lapsing from virtue and bent on sinful acts, attaineth
happiness, even as one doth by shaking off a venomous snake from his
hand. The wise have called that impious one given to stealing others'
goods and violating others' wives,--as worthy of being forsaken, even
like a house that is aflame.--Robbing others' property, outraging the
wives of others, and inspiring fear among friends,--these three vices
lead to destruction. The dreadful slaughter of sages, rebellion against
all ihe gods, overweening conceit, anger, long-continued enmity, and
running amuck of counsel,--these sins are sapping the life and fortune
of my brother; and they have hidden his virtues even as clouds cover a
mountain. It is on account of these vices that my brother, thy sire,
hath been deserted by me. And this city of Lanka will not be, nor thou,
nor thy father. Thou art proud, and haughty, and a boy, O Rakshasa. Thou
art fettered by the noose of Fate. Do thou say unto me whatever thou
likest. To-day thou hast addressed harshly me, who have fallen on evil
days; but, O worst of Rakshasas, thou canst not pass this Nyagrodha.
Having smitten the Kakutstha, thou canst not live. Fight with that
man-god, Lakshmana, in encounter. Being slain, thou shalt serve the
deities in the abode of Yama. Displaying thy own prowess, do thou spend
all thy weapons and all thy shafts. But coming within the ken of
Lakshmana's arrows, thou wilt not to-day go hence, living, with thy
forces".

[356] Or, on account of thy heroism.

[357] Some read _Vishamacilana_. Then the sense would be: 'How else
      could a brother bearing a difference in character, renounce his
      brother?' meaning Ravana.--T.



SECTION LXXXVIII.


Hearing Bibhishana's words, the son of Ravana, deprived of his senses by
passion, spoke harshly, and rushed forward in wrath. And with upraised
weapons and scimitars, he, resembling the Destroyer himself, was mounted
on a mighty car yoked with black steeds, and ornamented (on all sides).
And that one endowed with terrific strength up-raised a huge, gigantic,
strong and powerful bow, and shafts capable of destroying foes. And that
mighty bowman and slayer of foes--the powerful son of Ravana--adorned
(with ornaments) and mounted on his chariot, saw him dight (with his own
splendour). And fired with wrath, (Indrajit) addressed Sumitra's son,
who, mounted on Hanuman's back, like unto the risen sun in
splendour--accompanied Bibhishana; and he also addressed all those
principal monkeys, saying,--"Do ye behold my prowess! To-day do ye in
the conflict bear my arrowy shower shot from my bow, incapable of being
approached, and resembling the down-pour in the sky. To-day my shafts
discharged from my mighty bow shall mangle your limbs, even as fire
burneth up a heap of cotton. To-day with your persons pierced with sharp
shafts, with darts, and javelins, and _rishtis_ and arrows, shall I
despatch you all to the abode of Yama. Who shall stay before me,
fleet-handed, creating an arrowy shower in the field, and roaring like
unto clouds? Formerly in a night-engagement, with my shafts resembling
the thunder-bolt and _vajra_, ye two along with your foremost adherents,
were rendered insensible and laid down on the earth by me. But, perhaps,
thou hast forgotten it. As thou hast presented thyself for battle before
me, fired with wrath and resembling a venomous serpent, it is evident
thou wilt go to the region of Yama". Hearing the vaunt of the
Rakshasa-chief, Raghu's son, inflamed with rage, with an undaunted
countenance, spoke unto Ravana's son,--"O Rakshasa, hard is the
achievement of the task that thou hast mentioned. He that compasseth
business by act is alone intelligent.--But thou, O wicked-minded one,
incompetent as thou art to bring about thy end, attaining thy arduous
aim by words only, deemest thyself as crowned with success. That thou
hadst rendered thyself invisible in the field of conflict, was the work
of a thief,--and not the way of a hero. Coming within the range of thy
shafts, I stay here,--do thou display thy prowess. What dost thou say in
words?" Thus addressed, the mighty Indrajit--conquerer of
enemies--stretching his dreadful bow, showered sharpened shafts. And
discharged by him, those exceedingly impetuous arrows, resembling the
venom of serpents, hitting Lakshmana, fell down like unto hissing
snakes. And in that encounter, Ravana's son--Indrajit--possessed of
eminent impetuosity, pierced Lakshmana, graced with auspicious marks,
with vehement shafts. And pierced with those arrows and bathed in blood,
the graceful Lakshmana appeared like a smokeless fire. And seeing his
own feat, Indrajit, coming forward, and setting up a tremendous cry,
said,--"O son of Sumitra, my feathered and sharp-edged shafts shot from
my bow, capable of destroying life, will to-day finish thee up. To-day,
O Lakshmana, swarms of jackals and hosts of hawks and vultures shall
alight on thee lying lifeless, having been slain by me. This very day
shall the exceedingly wicked Rama behold thee, who art the friend of
Kshatriyas and devoted unto thy brother,--and who ever bearest thyself
ignobly,--slain by me; to-day see thee, O Sumitra's son, slain by me,
with thy armour fallen off thy person, thy bow broken, and thy head
severed". As Ravana's son was speaking thus harshly, Lakshmana
conversant with the import of words, replied in a reasonable speech,
saying,--"Leave off thy strength of tongue, O thou of perverse sense, O
Rakshasa, O thou of crooked ways! Wherefore dost thou speak thus? Bring
all this to pass in worthy deed. Why, O Rakshasa, without doing (what
thou sayest), dost thou simply say it? Do the deed,--so that I may have
regard for thy utterances. Mark! without speaking anything harsh,
without censuring thee in the least, without venting any brag, shall, I,
O cannibal, slay thee". Saying this, Lakshmana drawing his bow to its
full bent, hit at the Rakshasa's chest five _narachas_--wondrous
impetuous arrows. And those arrows resembling flaming serpents, with
their velocity accelerated by the feathers (with which they were
furnished), blazed on the Nairita's breast like the rays of the Sun. And
wounded with those shafts, Ravana's son, fired with wrath, pierced
Lakshmana with three arrows discharged (from his bow). And exceedingly
dreadful was the encounter that took place between those leonine man and
Rakshasa, each eager to conquer the other. And both powerful, and both
endowed with strength and possessed of prowess,--and both exceedingly
invincible; and both having unparalleled might and energy,--those heroes
faught like two planets in the welkin; or like Bala and Vrita,
irresistible in conflict; and those high-souled ones faught like two
lions. And showering countless shafts and displaying many maneuvers,
that foremost of men and that of Rakshasas, fought on cheerfully.



SECTION LXXXIX.


Then sighing like an enraged serpent, that chastiser of foes,
Dacaratha's son, setting shafts (on his bow-string) showered them on the
Rakshasa-chief. And hearing the twang of his bow-string the lord of
Rakshasas, with his countenance fallen, gazed at Lakshmana. And then
Bibhishana spoke unto Sumitra's son as he was fighting, "I find
(inauspicious) signs in Ravana's son. Do therefore hasten on,--broken he
is, without doubt". Then fixing arrows (on his bow) resembling venomous
snakes, he let go those keen shafts, like unto serpents furnished with
poison. And smit by Lakshmana with arrows having the touch of the levin,
(Indrajit) for a while was stupified and had his senses overwhelmed. And
eying that hero--son unto Dacaratha--present in the encounter,
(Indrajit) with his eyes crimsoned in choler, drew near Sumitra's son.
And coming up to him (Lakshmana), he again addressed (that hero) in a
harsh speech, saying,--"Dost thou not remember my prowess at that first
encounter, when thou along with thy brother was bound up,--that now thou
art discharging arms (at me)? Forsooth ye two in mighty encounter, with
shafts resembling the thunder-bolt and _vajra_, by me were first laid
down on the ground, deprived of your lives, along with your principal
adherents. Either this hath escaped thy memory or I fancy, thou plainly
wishest to go to the abode of Yama,--inasmuch as thou hast set thy heart
on beating me. If at the first encounter thou hast not witnessed my
prowess, to-day shall I show it unto thee. Do thou now stay, summoning
thy attention". Seeing this, he pierced Lakshmana with seven shafts, and
Hanuman with ten keen-edged excellent shafts. And then, fired with
double fury, that powerful one pierced Bibhishana with an hundred
arrows, powerfully discharged (from his weapons). Seeing this act of
Indrajit, that foremost of men, Rama's younger brother, Lakshmana, with
an undaunted countenance, fired with wrath without minding the
same,--and saying with a laugh,--'This is nothing',--taking dreadful
arrows, in the conflict, discharged them at the son of Ravana. "O
night-rangers, heroes, coming to the field never discharge (such shafts
as these). These arrows of thine are light and of slight strength, and
they conduce to my comfort. Heroic warriors, eager for encounter, do not
fight thus". Speaking thus, (Lakshmana) accoutred with his bow showered
vollies of shafts (on his adversary). And at his arrows (hitting),
(Indrajit's) mighty golden mail fell off his person, and dropped to the
platform of his car like a cluster of stars dropping from the welkin.
And with his armour dropping off, that hero--Indrajit--was wounded with
_narachas_, like the Sun at dawn. That hero--Ravana's son--endowed with
dreadful prowess, in that conflict, pierced Lakshmana with a thousand
shafts. And thereat Lakshmana's gorgeous and mighty mail was rent in
pieces. And each rushing forward was engaged in dealing blows and
harrying them. And sighing again and again, they fought furiously. And
with their persons cut all over, and laved in blood, for a long while
the heroes kept cleaving each other with sharpened shafts. And those
high-souled ones versed in warfare, and endowed with terrific prowess
exerted their utmost in securing victory. And covered with vollies of
shafts, with their armour and banners rent, they drew each other's warm
blood flowing like water from a fountain. And they discharged dreadful
showers attended with tremendous sounds, like the sounds of black clouds
at Dooms-day[358] pouring torrents in the sky. And a long time went by
as they faught. Nor did they turn away from the encounter, or know
fatigue. And those foremost of those acquainted with weapons repeatedly
displayed their weapons; and their long and short shafts enveloped the
welkin. And the skill that they displayed was perfect, and showed
lightness, variety and grace; and both man and the Rakshasa carried on
fearful and terrible conflict. And the dreadful and tremendous roars of
each were audible (at that place); and terrific like the levin, they
made the hearts of hearers tremble (in terror). And as they faught with
might and main, the sounds that they sent resembled the deep rumbling of
clouds in the sky. And pierced with _narachas_ knobbed with gold, those
powerful and illustrious (warriors) with their hearts set on celebrity,
bled profusely. And in that engagement gold-knobbed shafts hitting each
other's person, pierced the same and covered with gore, entered the
earth. And other shafts were resisted in the sky by sharpened weapons;
and some were snapped, and thousands of their arrows were cleft (in the
sky). And in that field, the vollies of their shafts were dreadful to
behold like unto a heap of Kuca aflame in a sacrifice. And the wounded
frames of those high-souled ones appeared beautiful like a leafless,
flowering Kincuka and Salmali in a wood. And each eager to vanquish the
other, Indrajit and Lakshmana momentarily discharged tremendous and
terrific showers (of arms). And Lakshmana smiting Ravana's son, and
Ravana's son smiting Lakshmana,--they did not experience any fatigue.
And with net-works of arrows deeply entering their persons, those
vehement and exceedingly powerful ones resembled mountains topped (with
trees). And all their limbs, drenched in blood and covered with arrows,
looked like a blazing fire. And a great while did they fight; yet they
neither turned away (from the fight), nor did they experience any
exhaustion. Then to remove (Lakshmana's) fatigue from fight, the
high-souled Bibhishana, working the weal of Lakshmana staying in front
of the field, came forward in the encounter and took up his post.

      clouds; but I prefer the sense given.--T.

Seeing the man and the Rakshasa engaged in battle, with their whole
soul, each eager to beat the other,--like unto elephants with the
temporal juice trickling from their temples,--desirous of beholding
their encounter, Ravana's mighty and heroic brother, bearing an
excellent bow, stood in front of the arena. And taking up his post, he
stretched his great bow and shot terrific sharp-pointed shafts at the
Rakshasas. And even like thunder-bolt cleaving mighty mountains, those
shafts furnished with peacock's plumes falling powerfully (upon the
foe), rent the Rakshasas. And those foremost of Rakshasas, Bibhishana's
followers, also, in the encounter discharged darts and scimitars and
_patticas_ at heroic Rakshasas. And surrounded by those Rakshasas,
Bibhishana, then in the midst of his followers, appeared like an
elephant in the midst of young ones. Then inciting the monkeys, whose
dear object was to slay Ravana, that one versed in time, the foremost of
Rakshasas, spoke seasonably thus,--"This one that stayeth (in the field)
is the sole and mighty support of the Rakshasa-chief; and this is his
remaining force. Why then do the monkey-chiefs remain inactive? On this
wicked Rakshasa being slain on the edge of battle, the remnant of his
army, with the single exception of Ravana, is destroyed. That
hero--Prahasta--hath been slain, and Nikumbha possessed of wondrous
strength, and Kumbhakarna, and Kumbha, and the night-ranger Dhumraksha,
and Jamvumali, and Mahamali, and Tikshnavega and Hemaprabha, and
Suptaghna, and Jajnakopa, and the Rakshasa Vajradanstra, Sankradi, and
Vikata, and Arighna, and Tapana, and Manda, and Praghasa, and Prajangha,
and Jangha, and Agniketu, and Durdharsha, and the powerful Racmiketus
and Viddujjibha, and Dwijibha, and the Rakshasa--Suryyacatru, and
Akampana, and Suparcwa, and the Rakshasas--Chakramali, and Kampana and
Satwavanta, and Devantaka and Narantaka.--Having slain these many
powerful Rakshasas endowed with excess of might,--having crossed the sea
with your arms, do ye cross this foot print of a cow. This is the
remaining force which you monkeys must conquer; all those Rakshasas,
that had come forward, elated with the pride of strength, have all been
slain. It is not meet for me to slay the son of my brother, yet, casting
off compassion will I for Rama slay him.[359] Tears surcharge the eyes
of me who seeketh to slay him. Let therefore Lakshmana administer him
his quietus. Ye monkeys, do ye in a body (first) slaughter those that
are beside him (Indrajit.)" Thus exhorted by that illustrious Rakshasa,
the monkey-chiefs were exhilarated and began to flourish their tails.
And then those mighty monkeys roared again and again, and sent up
various shouts, even as peacocks cry on seeing clouds. And then Jambavan
surrounded by his own forces, assailed the Rakshasas with rocks and with
their nails and teeth. Thereat Rakshasas, endowed with exceeding
strength, equipped with various weapons reproaching the lord of bears,
as he was engaged in smiting (the foe),--and renouncing fear, with
shafts and sharp axes and _patticas_ and _yashtis_, and _tomaras_, in
the encounter assailed Jambavan, who was engaged in beating the Rakshasa
forces. And that conflict between the monkeys and the Rakshas, waxed
furious, like unto the tumultuous encounter of the immortals and the
Asuras fired with wrath. And the magnanimous Hanuman incapable of being
approached growing wroth,--uprooting a mountain, and putting down
Lakshmana from his back, began a great carnage among the Rakshasas by
thousands. And fighting a furious fight with his uncle, the powerful
Indrajit--slayer of hostile heroes--again rushed against Lakshmana. And
then there took place an encounter between those heroes in the
field,--Lakshmana and the Rakshasa--discharging vollies of shafts and
smiting each other; and those mighty and impetuous ones repeatedly
covered each other with networks of arrows; like unto the sun and the
moon covered by clouds at the expiration of Summer. And on account of
their light-handedness, neither discharge of arrows, nor the drawing of
the bow; nor the setting of the shaft on the bow-string; nor the taking
of the bow; nor the selection of shafts; nor the clenching fast of their
fists; nor the hitting of aims,--could be perceived as they fought on.
And in consequence of the sky being covered with networks of arrows all
around, discharged powerfully from their bows, the forms (of objects)
could not be discovered. And Lakshmana having at Ravana's son, and
Ravana's son having at Lakshmana, critical was the huggermugger that
ensued[360] in the encounter between each other. And they both kept
ceaselessly showering feathered and sharpened shafts, the firmament was
engulphed with a deep darkness. And in consequence of countless keen
arrows alighting in hundreds, all sides and all the cardinal quarters
were swarming with shafts. And all being over-spread with gloom, a
mighty fright took possession (of creatures) when the Sun having
ascended the setting-hill, and darkness environing all objects. And that
day[361] mighty torrents of blood flowed in thousands of streams; and
fierce beasts of prey set up terrific yells (all around). And at that
hour the wind did not blow, and fire did not blaze; and the Maharshis
said,--'Fair befell creatures.' And the Gandharvas along with the
Charanas grew exceedingly agitated. Then Sumitra's son pierced the four
black steeds of the leonine Rakshasa, caparisoned in gold. And then he
hit at (Indrajit's) charioteer with another yellow and sharpened javelin
splendid, furnished with feathers; and resembling the thunder-bolt of
the great Indra. And through his fleet handedness the graceful son of
Raghu with the thunder-bolt of his shaft, resonant with the sound of his
palm, separated the (charioteer's head) from his trunk. And on his
charioteer having been slain the exceedingly energetic son of Mandodari,
himself began to perform the function of a charioteer, and took up his
bow. And this in the encounter was wonderful to behold. And then as
(Indrajit) was eagerly engaged in managing the steeds, (Lakshmana)
pierced him with sharpened shafts; and when (Indrajit) was eagerly
wielding his bow, (Lakshmana) discharged shafts at his steeds. And on
his steeds having been torn with shafts, Sumitra's--foremost of
fleet-handed--in the encounter assailed (Indrajit) doubtlessly ranging
the field. Seeing his charioteer slain in the contest, Ravana's son
forewent his martial ardour, and was cast down. And seeing the Rakshasa
with his face fallen, the leaders of monkey-bands, were exceedingly
delighted and rendered homage unto Lakshmana. And then those
monkey-chiefs--Pramathi, Rabhasa, Sarabha and Gandamadana, not brooking
(their foe) summoned their impetuosity. And suddenly springing up, those
highly powerful monkeys endowed with terrific prowess descended upon
those four best of steeds. And on those chargers being assailed by those
monkeys resembling mountains, blood gushed out of their mouths. And then
the steeds were smashed and sent to the ground. And having slain the
steeds, and smitten the mighty car-warrior[362] again by a vehement
bound, came to the side of Lakshmana. And springing down from his car
whose steeds had been slain, Ravana's son, his charioteer having been
pounded, charged the son of Sumitra with arrows. And then Lakshmana
resembling the great Indra, on (Indrajit's) best of chargers having been
despatched, in the encounter began to terribly rive with arrows
discharged (his foe) footing on the earth and showering excellent
sharpened shafts.

[360] i.e. in consequence of all sides being covered with arrows,

SECTION LXLI.


Having his steeds slain, the night-ranger--Indrajit, standing on the
ground, waxing fiercely angered, flamed up in energy. And armed with
bows, they, desirous of slaying each other with shafts resembled an
elephant and a bull in a forest, came out for securing victory in
encounter. And slaughtering owe another, the Rakshasas and the
wood-rangers, rushing this way and that, did not (for a moment) leave
their lords. Then Ravana's son, gladdening all the Rakshasas, and
himself feeling cheered, addressed them in words of praise,
saying,--"All sides are entirely enveloped in this gloom,--so that, O
foremost of Rakshasas, here we do not know who belongeth onto us and who
not.--Do ye fight fearlessly for stupifying the monkeys; and I too,
mounted on a car, shall come hither into the conflict. Do ye so act that
the high-souled rangers of the woods may not attack me as I enter the
city". Saying this, that slayer of foes--Ravana's son, deceiving the
wood-rangers, entered the city of Lanka for providing himself with a
(fresh) car. And embellishing a chariot, graceful and adorned with gold,
furnished with _pracas_ and swords and arrows, yoked with superb steeds,
and driven by a charioteer, knowing horses and possessed of instructions
(anent his art),--that victor in battle--the exceedingly energetic son
of Ravana--ascended it. And that hero, Mandodari's son, urged on by the
force of the Finisher, went out of the city, surrounded by the foremost
Rakshasas; and drawn by fast-speeding steeds, he presented himself
before Lakshmana along with Bibhishana. And seeing Ravana's son seated
on the car, the son of Sumitra and the exceedingly powerful monkeys and
the Rakshasa--Bibhishana---were highly amazed at the lighthandedness of
that intelligent one. And Ravana's son, waxing furious, in that contest
began to bring down monkeys by hundreds and by thousands. And that
victor in battle--Ravana's son--fired with wrath, summoning all his
celerity, slaughtered monkeys, drawing his bow into a circle. And
slaughtered by _narachas_ of terrific impetuosity, the monkeys saught
the shelter of Sumitra's son, like creatures seeking the refuge of their
Lord. Then the son of Raghu, flaming up in martial wrath, severed
his[363] bow, displaying his fleethandedness. Thereat, taking another
bow, (Indrajit) hurriedly fastened the string to it. And this bow also
did Lakshmana cut off by means of a brace of arrows. And when (Indrajit)
had his bow severed, Sumitra's son pierced the son of Ravana with five
shafts resembling the venom of a poisonous serpent. And the shafts
discharged from his[364] mighty bow, piercing his[365] person, dropped
to the earth like unto powerful red serpents. And having his bow cut
off, Ravana's son, vomitting blood by his mouth, took up a superior bow
powerful to a degree and having a stout string. And then aiming at
Lakshmana, he, summoning his utmost celerity, showered arrows, as
showereth Purandara in the season of rains. Thereat Lakshmana, subduer
of enemies, retaining his calmness, resisted that powerful arrowy shower
shot by Indrajit. And then that exceedingly energetic one, Raghu's son,
possessing himself in calmness, displayed (his prowess) unto the son of
Ravana; and this was wonderful (to behold). And then displaying his
lightness in the use of weapons, Lakshmana, growing furious, pierced the
Rakshasas with three arrows each in that mighty encounter; and the lord
of Rakshasas struck him with showers of shafts. And pierced sore by that
powerful enemy--slayer of foes--he incessantly sent innumerable arrows
after Lakshmana. And ere they reached their destination, that slayer of
hostile heroes severed them with whetted arrows; and in the encounter
that righteous one and foremost of car-warriors with a dart having bent
joints, cut off the head of his charioteer mounted on the car. And
deprived of their driver, there the steeds, retaining their calmness,
began to go in rounds,--and this was wonderful Then Sumitra's son of
steady prowess, fired with anger, in that contest, frightening all,
pierced his horses with arrows. And not brooking that act (of his
adversary), Ravana's son in the encounter pierced with ten shafts
Sumitra's son capable of making people's down stand on end. And his
shafts resembling thunderbolts, and like unto all varieties of venom,
touching (Lakshmana's) mail having a golden splendour, were reduced to
naught. Thereat considering Lakshmana as clad in an impenetrable armour,
Ravana's son--Indrajit--growing furiously enraged, displaying his
lighthandedness in arms, pierced Lakshmana in the temples with three
well-knobbed shafts. And with those arrows lodged in his temples,
Raghu's son, delighting in battle, appeared beautiful in the field like
a mountain furnished with three summits. Albeit thus smitten in the
contest by the Raksha with shafts, Lakshmana swiftly smote him in turn
with five arrows; and in the encounter Lakshmana drawing his bow,
pierced with shafts Indrajit's face graced with elegant ear-rings. And
those heroes--Lakshmana and Indrajit--equipped with exceedingly powerful
bows, and endowed with heroism and dreadful prowess, wounded each other
with sharp arrows. And both Lakshmana and Indrajit, with their persons
bathed in blood in that encounter, appeared like unto flowering
Kincukas. And approaching each other, those bowmen, each telling his
heart on victory, wounded each other all over the body with terrific
shafts. Then Ravana's son, carried away by martial rage, pierced
Bibhishana in his handsome face With three arrows. And piercing the lord
of Rakshasas, Bibhishana, he with three iron-headed arrows, pierced the
monkey-leaders each with a shaft. Thereat, enraged at him more furiously
than ever, the exceedingly energetic Bibhishana with his mace despatched
the steeds of the wicked-minded son of Ravana. Then jumping down from
his chariot with its horses slain, (Indrajit), endowed with great
energy, who had his charioteer pounded, discharged a dart at his uncle.
And seeing it descend, the enhancer of Sumitra's joy severed the same
with whetted arrows and brought it down in ten fragments to the ground.
And Bibhishana of a tough bow, growing enraged, discharged at
(Indrajit), who had his steeds slain, five speeding shafts having the
touch of the thunder-bolt.--And those arrows furnished with gold at the
feathered parts, riving his person, were bathed in blood, and resembled
mighty red serpents. Thereat wroth with his uncle, Indrajit took op an
excellent shaft--bestowed on him by Yama himself--endowed with terrific
force,--the flower of shafts among all the Rakshas. And seeing that
mighty shaft set by him (on the bow-string), the highly powerful
Lakshmana, possessed of dreadful prowess, (in his turn) took up another
arrow, bestowed by Kuvera himself of immeasurable soul in a
dream,--unconquerable, and incapable of being borne even by the
celestials and Asuras with Indra at their head. And on their best of
bows being powerfully drawn with their arms resembling bludgeons, they
set up cries like unto Kraunchas. And on those foremost of shafts set on
those excellent bows of those heroes, being drawn, flamed up in
exceeding splendour. And those flaming arrows, discharged from the bows,
illumining the welkin, with vehemence struck at each other's head. And a
concussion took place of those arrows of terrific aspects; and a furious
fire sprang up thereat, with embers shooting around. And dashing against
each other like unto mighty planets, they, reduced to an hundred shivers
in the encounter, saught the earth. Seeing their shafts baffled,
Indrajit and Lakshmana, staying on the edge of the battle, were seized
with shame and wrath. Thereat Sumitra's son, flying into a fury, took up
a Varuna weapon. And the conquerer of the great Indra intent on battle,
in the encounter discharged a terrific Raudra weapon; and the
exceedingly wonderful Varuna weapon was baffled by him. Then, waxing
wroth, that victor in battle--the wondrous energetic Indrajit--as if
annihilating the world, discharged a flaming Agneya weapon. And the
heroic Lakshmma resisted it with a Solar weapon. Seeing his weapon
resisted, Ravana's son, transported with passion, took up an Asura
arrow, capable of rending foes. And from that weapon issued daggers and
clubs and darts and _bhucundis_ and maces and swords and axes.[366] And
in the conflict, seeing that dire and dreadful weapon, irrisistible to
all creatures and capable of riving all arms, the effulgent Lakshmana
baffled it with a Mahecwara[367] weapon. And the encounter that took
place between them was wonderful and capable of making people's down
stand on end. And beings stationed in the sky surrounded Lakshmana on
all sides. And in that terrific encounter of the monkeys and the
Rakshasas resounding with dreadful roars, the welkin was covered with
innumerable beings seized with wonderment. And saints and _Pitris_ and
deities and Gandharbas and birds and serpents, placing Satakratu in
their front, protected Lakshmana in the conflict. And then that hero,
Raghava's younger brother, fixed (on his bow) another superior shaft,
having the feel of fire itself, and capable of riving the son of Ravana;
furnished with fair feathers; tapering; having elegant joints;
symmetrical; and plated with gold,--an arrow capable of finishing the
body; irrisistible; dreadful; terrific unto Rakshasas; resembling the
venom of poisonous serpents; and worshipped by the celestial hosts; by
which the exceedingly energetic and wonderful Lord riding the
horse[368]--Sakra--of old in the war between the celestials and the
Asuras had defeated the Danavas. And Sumitra's son, Lakshmana; graced
with auspiciousness, drawing on his best of bows that foremost of
shafts--the Aindra weapon--invincible in conflict, spoke these words,
tending to bring about his success,[369]--"If Dacaratha's son--Rama--is
righteous and truthful, and if in prowess he hath no rival, then slay
this son of Ravana". Saying this, the heroic Lakshmana in that conflict,
drawing the straight-speeding arrow up to his ear,[370] discharged it at
Indrajit. And shooting the Aindra weapon, that destroyer of hostile
heroes--Lakshmana--severing from its trunk the head of Indrajit with its
corslet, graced with burning ear-rings, brought it down to the ground.
And the mighty severed head of the Rakshasa's son, resembling one made
of gold, was seen covered with blood. And slain, Ravana's son dropped to
the earth, with his armour and corslet on, and his bow fallen (from his
grasp). And then all the monkeys with Bibhishana set up cheers, even as
the immortals cheered at the destruction of Vritra. And in the sky there
arose the victorious shouts of all beings and high souled saints, and
also of Gandharbas and Apsaras. And knowing (Indrajit) fallen (in
fight), the mighty army of Rakshasas; attacked by monkeys burning for
victory, fled in the ten cardinal directions. And assailed by the
monkeys, the Rakshasas, pursued (by their foes), with their senses lost,
rushed towards Lanka, leaving their arms behind. And overwhelmed with
fright, Rakshasas fled in an hundred directions, all renouncing their
arms--bearded darts, and swords, and axes. And harassed by the monkeys,
some hurriedly entered Lanka, and some plunged into the sea, and some
saught shelter in the mountains. And seeing Indrajit slain and lying
down on the field of battle, thousands of Rakshasas fled away. As when
the Sun sets, his rays remain no longer, on that Rakshasa having fallen,
the Rakshasas dispersed in the ten cardinal quarters, like unto the Sun
when his rays have been rendered mild, or fire which hath been
extinguished. And the mighty-armed (Indrajit) was utterly reft of life.
And on the son of the Rakshasa-chief falling, the world, having its foe
slain, with its huge affliction gone off, experienced the bright of joy.
And on that unrighteous Rakshasa having been slain, the reverend Sakra
together with the Maharshis was filled with delight. And sounds of
kettle-drums were heard in the sky proceeding from the celestials. And
blossoms were showered by dancing Apsaras and high-souled Gandharbas.
And this was wonderful (to behold.) And on that Rakshasa of fell deeds
having been slain, the dust was laid, the water became transparent, the
sky looked bright, and the deities and Danavas were filled with
rejoicings. And on that Dread of all creatures having been slain, the
gods, Gandharbas and Danavas, assembled together in joy, said,--"Now let
the Brahmanas who have their sins removed, with their anxiety gone off,
range about". And then the monkey-leaders, seeing that foremost of
Nairitas of unparalleled prowess slain in battle, began to gladly pay
homage (unto Lakshmana). And Bibhishana and Hanuman and Jambavan--leader
of bears--saluted and hymned Lakshmana on the score of his victory. And
shouting and bounding and roaring, the monkeys at this hour of high joy
stood surrounding Raghu's son.[371] And flourishing their tails and
striking the earth (with them), the monkeys shouted,--'Victory unto
Lakshmana!' And embracing each other, the monkeys with delighted spirits
began to converse in various ways touching Raghava's welfare. And
beholding that deed, difficult of being done, performed by their beloved
friend--Lakshmana--and hearing their foe--Indrajit--slain (in battle),
the celestials attained the summit of joy.

Having in the conflict slain that conquerer of enemies, Lakshmana graced
with auspicious marks, with his body bathed in blood, experienced
delight. And then supporting himself on Bibhishana and Hanuman, the
exceedingly powerful Lakshmana endowed with prowess, taking Jambavan,
Hanuman and all the monkeys with him, speedily went to the place where
Sugriva and Raghava were. And then going round Rama and saluted him,
Sumitra's son stood before his brother, like Indra's brother staying
before Sakra. And approaching with a look which of itself was
significant,[372] the heroic Bibhishana described unto the high-souled
Raghava the dreadful destruction of Indrajit. And then the delighted
Bibhishana related unto Rama how the high-souled Lakshmana had cut off
the head of Ravana's son. And as soon as that exceedingly powerful one
heard of the destruction of Indrajit by Lakshmana, he experienced a huge
accession of joy, and thus delivered himself,--"Excellent, O Lakshmana!
Pleased am I (with thee). Thou hast performed a difficult feat. The son
of Ravana having been slain, know for certain that we have been
victorious". And then smelling the head of the bashful Lakshmana,
enhancer of fame, (Rama) endowed with prowess, from affection forcibly
hugged him into his lap. And making him seat on his lap, and
overpowering him with embraces,[373] (Rama) again and again tenderly
eyed his brother, Lakshmana. And moved with grief, that best of persons,
Rama, smelling the head of Lakshmana, wounded with darts and having his
person pierced (with arms), sighing and breathing hard--and nursing his
body with his hand, addressed Lakshmana, soothing him,--'To-day his son
having been slain, I deem Ravana himself as slain in fight. On that
wicked-minded enemy of mine having been destroyed, I am victorious (in
encounter). By luck, O hero, hast thou in conflict severed the right arm
of the fell Ravana. Verily he (Indrajit) was his stay. Both Bibhishana
and Hanuman have done mighty deeds in battle. In three days and nights,
(my enemy) hath been brought down. To-day have I been made foeless. Now
Ravana will for certain march forth,--backed by a mighty phalanx. Ravana
will for certain sally out, hearing his son brought down. That
unconquerable lord of Rakshasas, aggrieved for the destruction of his
son, marching out,--shall I slay, environed with a mighty force. O
Lakshmana, the conqueror of Sakra having in battle been slain by
thee--who art my lord--Sita and the (entire) earth are not incapable of
being obtained by me". Having thus soothed and embraced his brother,
Raghu's son--Rama--highly rejoiced, calling Sushena, said,--"Do thou so
act that this highly wise son of Sumitra, devoted to his friends, may be
healed and be eased. Do thou without delay heal Sumitra's son, attached
to his friends, of his wounds. And do thou also carefully relieve all
those heroes in the army of bears and monkeys fighting with trees,--as
well as others, who have been wounded and have got sores (in
consequence)". Thus addressed by Rama, the high-souled monkey-leader
administered a potent medicine to the nose of Lakshmana. And smelling
the same, he got healed; he was relieved of his pain and his outgoing
vitality was shut up. And at the mandate of Raghava he likewise treated
his friends headed by Bibhishana and all the principal monkeys. And
restored to his natural condition, Sumitra's son, healed, and with his
exhaustion removed, and his suffering gone off in a moment, experienced
exhilaration of spirits. And Rama and the monkey-king and Bibhishana and
the powerful lord of bears along with their hosts, seeing Sumitra's son
risen hale, rejoiced greatly in delight. And the high-souled son of
Dacaratha honored exceedingly that exceedingly hard feat of Lakshamana;
and the monkey-king, hearing that the conquerer of Sakra had fallen in
fight, was filled with joy.

[372] _i.e._ of the destruction of Indrajit.

SECTION LXLIII.


When the counsellors of Pulastya's son, hearing of Indrajit having been
slain, speedily conveyed the tidings unto the Ten-necked one, who was
ignorant[374] of the same. "O mighty monarch, in our very sight thy
exceedingly effulgent son hath been slain by Lakshmana with the help of
Bibhishana. And that hero confronted by the (other) hero, hath been
vanquished in fight. And the hero, thy son, the conquerer of the
celestial chief, hath also been slain by Lakshmana. And having gratified
Lakshmana with his shafts, he hath repaired to the supreme regions".
Hearing of that mighty terror, _viz._, the rueful and dreadful
destruction of his son, Indrajit, in battle, he straightway swooned
away. Then regaining his consciousness after a long while, that foremost
of Rakshasas--the king--overwhelmed with grief for his son, and
distressed, burst into lamentations, with his senses
wildered,--thus,--"O foremost in the Rakshasa army! O my child endowed
with high might! Having conquered Indra himself, wherefore to-day hast
thou come under the sway of Lakshmana? Doubtless, thou enraged could
pierce with thy arrows the Destroyer of Time himself, and the summit of
Mandara,--what shall I say of Lakshmana in encounter? To-day king
Viwacwata hath raised himself immensely in my estimation, for to-day he,
O mighty-armed one, hath brought thee under the law of Time. But this is
the way of capable warriors as well as celestials. He that layeth down
his life for his lord, repaireth to heaven. To-day seeing Indrajit
slain, the deities and the guardians of the worlds, and the mighty
saints, their fear gone off, shall sleep peacefully. This triple world
and this entire earth with her woods, reft of one--Indrajit--appear to
me as vacant. To-day shall I hear the cries of the daughters of the
Nairitas in my inner apartment, like unto the roars of she-elephants in
a mountain-cavern. Renouncing thy state of an heir-apparent, and Lanka
and the Rakshas, O subduer of enemies, and thy mother, and me, and thy
wife--whither hast thou gone, (leaving) us all? O hero, I having gone to
the region of Yama, thou ought to have performed my last rites, but thou
standest in a relation the very reverse of this.[375] And Sugriva living
and Lakshmana and Raghava, without extracting my dart, whither hast thou
gone, leaving us all? And then vising from the disaster that had
befallen his son, a mighty wrath overcame the lord of Rakshasas--Ravana,
as he was thus indulging in lamentations. And even as in summer, the
(Solar) rays flame up the Sun, the destruction of his son flamed up all
the fiercer, him, who was naturally irascible. And as he kept yawning in
passion, a flaming fire with smoke darted from his mouth, even as it did
from the mouth of Vritra. And burning in grief for the destruction of
his son, and coming under masterdom of passion, that
hero--Ravana--reflecting (awhile) in his mind, resolved upon slaying
Vaidehi. And naturally red, and reddened (still more) by the fire of
wrath, Ravana's glowing eyes were dreadful (to behold). And his form,
terrific by nature, in consequence of the fire of his wrath having
possessed it entirely, resembled the form of the enraged Rudra. And from
the eyes of that infuriated one fell drops of tears as drop from a
flaming lamp drops of burning oil. And as he grinded his teeth, the
gnashing resembled the sounds sent by the machine[376] drawn by the
Danavas and churning the deep. The Rakshasas durst not approach that one
eying round and resembling the Destroyer himself, intent, on devouring
both mobile and immobile. Then exceedingly enraged, Ravana--lord of
Rakshasas--spoke in the midst of the Rakshasas, inciting them to
battle,--"I practised severe austerities for thousands of years; and
gratified the Self-sprung at times. Neither from Asuras nor from
celestials can any fear spring to me. My mail conferred on me by Brahma,
which in effulgence resembles the Sun himself, was not broken by blows
like unto thunder-bolt at the war between the deities and demons. To-day
who will come forward against me in battle accoutred in that and mounted
on a car in the conflict? Not even Purandara himself. Do ye, beating
hundreds of drums, to-day raise that mighty and dreadful bow of mine
which, with arrows, had been bestowed on one by the gratified
Self-sprung at the war of the gods and Asuras,--so that I may therewith
compass the destruction of Rama and Lakshmana in mighty battle". Burning
(in grief) for the destruction of his son, the fell Ravana, coming under
the influence of anger, reflecting (in his mind), resolved to slay Sita.
And eying round, that copper-eyed and dreadful one of a terrific aspect,
distressed, in a piteous voice addressed all the night-rangers,
saying,--"By his power of illusion, my beloved child, for deceiving the
wood-rangers, slaying something (else), had shown it unto them as Sita.
Now will I do that good office myself,--Vaidehi will I slay--even her
that is devoted to that friend of Kshatriyas". Having spoken thus unto
his counsellors, he swiftly took up a sword; and raising it, of
excellent temper and of cerulean hue, he rushed out vehemently,
surrounded by his wives and counsellors. From grief for his son. Ravana
with his consciousness wildered, taking up a sword, in rage, rushed
towards the place where Mithila's daughter was. Seeing the Rakshasa
rising on, some, emitted leonine roars, and seeing the Rakshasa enraged,
embracing each other, said,--"To-day those two brothers, seeing this
one, will be exceedingly pained. By this one, influenced with passion
were the four guardians of the worlds conquered; and many other foes
were brought down in battle. Procuring gems from the three worlds,
Ravana enjoyeth them. Neither in strength nor in prowess is there any
one on earth who is his compeer". As they were speaking thus, Ravana,
reft of his senses by wrath, rushed against Vaidehi, who had taken up
her abode in the Acoka wood. And dissuaded by his friends endowed with
good intelligence, he, wrought up with high wrath, darted (against
Sita), even as an enraged planet[377] rusheth against Rohini[378] in the
firmament. And the blameless daughter of Mithila protected by the
Rakshasis, saw the infuriated Ravana bearing that best of blades in his
hand. Seeing (Ravana) approach, sword in hand, despite the earnest
entreaties of his friends, Janaka's daughter, Sita, pained and overcome
by grief, said, weeping,--"From the way in which, wrought up with wrath,
this wicked-minded one is rushing on at me personally, it appears that
he will slay me, who have a lord, as one who hath not. He did urge me
much ever devoted to my lord, saying 'Be thou my wife but forsooth I
disregarded him. And plainly in consequence of my refusal, he hath given
way to despair. And overcome by anger and passion, he is ready to slay
me. Or it may be that to-day for me those foremost of men, the
brothers--Rama and Lakshmana--have been slain in encounter by this
inglorious one. I heard a furious and fearful uproar raised by countless
Rakshasas rejoicing, and expressing their delight.--Alas! O fie! For me
those princes have met with destruction. Or it may be that not without
slaying Rama and Lakshmana, this terrific Rakshasa, having his heart set
on sin, from grief for his son, will slay me. Fool that I am, I did not
then act agreeably to Hanuman's words. If I had gone away seated on his
back, without waiting for the victory (of my lord), I devoted to him,
placed on his lap, should not have come by this repentance. When
Kaucalya, having an only son, will hear of her son slain in battle, I
fancy, her heart shall burst. And, weeping, she will remember that
high-souled one's birth and boyhood, and youth and pious acts and
loveliness. And that one bereft of her consciousness, filled with
despair, after having performed his _sraddha_[379] will doubtless enter
into fire or water. Shame on the unchaste and hump-backed Manthara,
having her heart fixed in sin, for whose sake this grief shall exercise
Kaucalya!" Seeing the distressed daughter of Mithila lament thus, like
unto Rohini come under the sway of a planet in the absence of the Moon,
in the meanwhile his[380] pure and good courtier, named Suparcwa,
endowed with intelligence, albeit prevented by other courtiers, spoke
unto Ravana, foremost of Rakshasas,--"Wherefore, O Ten-necked one, O
thou who art the very younger brother of Vaicravana himself, Dost thou
desire to slay Vaidehi, forsaking righteousness? Why, O hero! O lord of
Rakshasas! having led the Brahmacharyya mode of life, studied the Vedas,
and returned from the house of thy spiritual guide, and ever engaged in
religious acts, to-day dost thou intend to slay a woman? Do thou, O
king, now stay expecting Mithila's daughter[381] endowed with
loveliness; and do thou along with us vent thy wrath on him.[382] To-day
being the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, do thou this very day
prepare for conflict; at _amavasya_,[383] environed with thy forces, do
thou march for victory. Heroic, and intelligent, a mighty car-warrior
and swordsman, thou, mounted on a car, slaying the redoubtable son of
Dacaratha, wilt obtain Mithila's daughter". Thus exhorted by his friend,
the unrighteous Ravana accepted his virtuous speech; and then that
powerful one went (back) to his house, and, surrounded by his friends,
entered the court.

SECTION LXLIV.


Entering his court, the king, distressed, and exceedingly aggrieved, sat
him down on the foremost seat sighing like an enraged lion. And stricken
with grief in consequence of his son's death, that highly powerful
Ravana, with folded hands, addressed all the heroic Rakshasas,
saying:--"Do ye all proceed to battle with elephants, horses and cars.
And encircling Rama only and discharging shafts at him, delightedly,
like unto clouds, in the rainy season, pouring water, do ye slay him. Or
I shall slay him to-morrow in the presence of all, wounded by you in the
mighty encounter with sharpened arrows". Hearing the speech of their
lord the Rakshasas, with a huge army and a host of cars, speedily issued
out for battle. And they all threw at the monkeys life-destroying
_Parighas_, _Patticas_, arrows, daggers and _Paraskwadhas_. And the
monkeys too threw crags and trees at the Rakshasas. Thus on the eve of
sun set there arose a terrible conflict between the Rakshasas and the
monkeys. And they struck each other in the conflict with clubs,
_chitras_, _Prasas_, daggers and _Paraskwadhas_. The conflict being thus
carried on, there arose a mighty dust which was again destroyed by the
current of blood gushing out of the persons of the Rakshasas and the
monkeys. Elephants and cars were like the banks of that river of blood,
the arrows were like the fishes, and the flags were the trees on their
banks and the corpses were like planks afloat there. Being thus wounded
and assailed by the Rakshasas, those heroic monkeys leaped and broke
down the flags, armours, cars, horses and other weapons. And with their
sharp teeth and nails they scratched the hair, ears, foreheads and the
noses of the Rakshasas. Like unto vultures falling upon a felled tree,
hundreds of monkeys fell upon one Rakshasa in that encounter. And the
Rakshasas resembling mountains, with huge clubs, _prasas_, daggers and
_parashwadhas_, struck the monkeys (in their turn). Being thus assailed
by the Rakshasas, the mighty host of monkeys took refuge of Rama, the
son of Dacaratha, the worthy refuge of all creatures. Thereupon the
highly effulgent and powerful Rama, taking up his bow, entered the
Rakshasa host and began to make a downpour of arrows. And Rama entering
the field, those terrible Rakshasas, being burnt with the fire of his
arrows, could not stand before him like unto clouds disappearing before
the Sun in the welkin. And the night-rangers only espied the dreadful
feats performed by Rama and which were above the power of others. Except
when guiding the huge army or driving the cars they could not see Rama
like unto the wind invisible in a forest. They all beheld the Rakshasa
force scattered, wounded, burnt down with arrows, broken and assailed
with weapons, by Rama, but none could see the quick-moving Rama. As
people cannot see the soul which governs all objects of sense so they
could not see Rama, who was thus inflicting wounds on them. "It is he
who is destroying the soldiers riding the elephants, it is he who is
breaking down the mighty cars, and it is he who with sharp arrows is
slaying the cavalry--rider and horse". Thus saying those Rakshasas, in
that conflict and in the very presence of Rama, highly enraged, began to
slay each other. They were all bewildered by the huge Gandharba weapon
discharged by the high-souled Rama and so they could not see Rama, who
was thus burning down their force. And the Rakshasas sometimes beheld
thousands of Rama in the battle field and again saw one Rama only. They
at times saw the quick-moving golden end of the bow of that high-souled
one, resembling a circular fire brand but they did not behold Raghava.
And he looked like _kala chakra_, having his middle body as its navel,
his own strength as its lustre, the arrow for its radius or spoke, the
bow for the circumference, the twang of the bow for its sound, his power
and intelligence for its brightness, and the aim of the celestial
weapons for its limit. And in the eighth division of the time by Rama
alone with arrows resembling the flame of fire were destroyed ten
thousands swift-coursing cars, eighteen thousand elephants fourteen
thousands horses and riders and two million Rakshasa infantry assuming
shapes at will. And those night-rangers, who were still left, having
their horses killed, cars and flags broken, fled in fear of life to the
city of Lanka. And the battle field, filled with slain horses elephants
and infantry, looked like the high-souled and enraged Rudra's arena of
sports. Thereupon the celestials with Gandharbas, Siddhas and the great
ascetics glorified the wonderful feat of Rama. And the virtuous-souled
Rama addressed Sugriva, Bibhishana the monkey Hanuman, the leading
monkey Jambavan, Mainda and Divida who were near him, saying--"This is
the power of my weapons and as well as that of Rudra". The high-souled
Rama, equalling Sakra in prowess, thus slaying the huge host of the lord
of Rakshasas and assailing them with shafts and weapons--the celestials,
delighted, sang his praises.



SECTION LXLV.


By Rama, of unwearied actions, with flaming arrows feathered in burning
gold, were destroyed thousands of elephants--many horses with their
riders, many a car crested with flaming banners; thousands of heroic
Rakshasas assuming shapes at will, engaged by Ravana, and armed with
clubs and _parighas_; and golden pennons. Beholding and hearing of this
the remaining night-rangers assembled and were greatly bewildered,
poorly and stricken with anxiety. The widows and those who had lost
their children or kinsmen approached those Rakshasas and overwhelmed
with grief, bewailed piteously,--"Alas! why did the aged and
grim-visaged Surpanakha, having her belly extending down-ward, behold in
the forest Rama graceful like Kandarpa. And beholding him of great
beauty and prowess, ever engaged in the welfare of all creatures, that
ugly one, worthy of being slain by people, was excited with lust. Why
did that ugly-faced she-demon, devoid of all qualities, address Rama,
having a beautiful countenance, gifted with many virtues and great
effulgence? Alas for the misfortune of the Rakshasas, the aged Rakshasee
brought before him such a vile proposal, hated of all and worthy of
creating laughter. For the destruction of Khara, Dushana and other
Rakshasas that ugly one approached Raghava with such a vile intention.
It was for her that Ravana created enmity (with Rama) and Sita was
carried away by the Ten-necked Rakshasa. But he could not spread his
influence upon Sita the daughter of king Janaka and deep rooted and
eternal became the enmity with the highly powerful Raghava. And
beholding the Rakshasa Biradha slain by Rama alone--(Ravana) wishing
Vaidehi should have regarded that as a sufficient proof of his prowess.
And fourteen thousand Rakshasas of terrible deeds were slain by him in
Janasthana with shafts resembling the flame of fire. Khara, Dushana as
well as Tricira were slain by him in conflict with arrows resembling the
Sun--this was a sufficient proof (of his power). Yoyanabahu and
Kavandha, drinking blood, were slain by him, roaring with wrath--this
too was a sufficient proof of his power. Rama slew the powerful Vali,
the son of the thousand eyed one, resembling the cloud--that too was the
sufficient proof of his prowess. By him Sugriva, poorly and living in
the mount Rishyamukha, having all his desires frustrated, was placed on
the throne--that too even was the sufficient proof of his power. He
(Ravana) from foolishness did not like the becoming speech of Bibhishana
conducive to the acquirement of piety and wealth and securing the
welfare of the Rakshasas. Had the younger brother of the lord of wealth
(Ravana) observed the words of Bibhishana, Lanka would not have been
overwhelmed with grief and reduced to the state of a cremation ground.
Hearing of the destruction of the highly powerful Kumbhakarna by Rama.
of the irrepressible Atikaya by Lakshmana as well as of his beloved son
Indrajit, Ravana did not come to his senses.[384] There is audible in
every house of the Rakshasas, the cry,--'My son, my brother, my husband
is slain in battle.' In conflict have been destroyed by the heroic Rama,
thousand cars, horses, serpents and infantry. Perhaps Rudra, Vishnu,
Mahendra or the performer of hundred sacrifices, or even Death, in the
shape of Rama, is slaying us. By Rama all the heroes have been
slain--despair has taken possession of our minds--we do not behold the
end of our terror and are bewailing being deprived of our lords. Does
not the Ten-necked hero, who has obtained boons (from Brahma) perceive
that a mighty disaster shall befall him from Rama? Neither the
celestials, Gandharbas, Picachas nor Rakshasas shall be able to save him
from Rama in conflict. In every battle many an accident befalls
Ravana--this bespeaks of his destruction at the hands of Rama. The great
Patriarch, being pleased, conferred upon Ravana the boon that no fear
would proceed unto him from the celestials, the Danavas or the
Rakshasas--but he did not beg of him, security from men. Forsooth, he is
that fearful man who shall slay Ravana and the Rakshasas. The
celestials, being thus oppressed by Ravana, who had obtained the boon,
worshipped the great Patriarch with severe austerities. And being
propitiated with them, the high-souled Patriarch, for their welfare,
addressed the celestials, with the following pregnant speech. "From
to-day shall the Rakshasas and Danavas roam for ever, afraid of the
celestials". Thereupon the celestials headed by Indra engaged in
propitiating Mahadeva, the slayer of Tripura, and who rides upon a bull.
And being pleased, Mahadeva addressed them, saying,--"For your welfare
there will be born a woman who shall be the cause of the destruction of
the Rakshasas". As hunger, being engaged by the celestials, did destroy
in olden time, all the Danavas, so shall she (Sita) the root of the
extinction of Rakshasa race destroy us all with Ravana. Alas! for the
foolishness of the vicious-minded and insolent Ravana destruction has
faced us and we are overwhelmed with grief. We do not see any such being
in the world who can afford us shelter. Raghava has attacked us like
unto the fire of dissolution. There is no refuge for us who have been
stricken with fear as no help reaches the elephants in a forest beset
with fire. The high-souled Bibhishana did the just thing in proper
time--he took shelter of him from whom he expected danger". Thus
bewailed piteously and loudly--the she-demons holding each other by the
neck and being stricken with fear and grief.

[384] One _sloka_ has been omitted here by some of the editors, which
      when translated stands thus:--When one monkey only Hanuman killed
      the prince Akshaya and reduced the whole city to ashes with the
      fire of his tail. Ravana should have come to his senses.



SECTION LXLVI.


Whereupon Ravana heard in every house of Lanka the piteous cries of the
she-demons possessed by sorrow. And sighing hard he engaged in
meditation for some time. And terrible-looking as he was, Ravana was
greatly worked up with ire. Having his eyes reddened with anger, and
gnashing his teeth and biting the lips, that one, irrepressible by other
Rakshasas, looked like the fire of dissolution incarnate. Thereupon the
lord of Rakshasas in anger as if burning down everything with his look,
addressed the Rakshas who were near him--Mahodara, Mahaparsha,
Birupaksha--"Do ye speedily speak to the soldiers that they should sally
out for battle at my command. Hearing his speech--those Rakshas,
possessed by fear, asked by the command of the king, the Rakshasa
soldiers to be ready. And thereat all those grim-visaged Rakshasas
saying 'so be it' and performing benedictory ceremonies proceeded to the
battle-field. And those mighty car-warriors, worshipping Ravana, and
desiring the victory of their lord, stood before them with folded hands.
Thereupon Ravana, beside himself with anger, laughing, adddressed those
Rakshasas, Mahodara, Mahaparsha, and Birupaksha, saying--"To-day shall I
despatch both Rama and Lakshmana to the abode of Death with arrows
resembling the sun at the time of dissolution, discharged off my bow.
And slaying the enemies I shall repair the loss of Khara, Kumbhakarna,
Prahasta and Indrajit. The atmosphere, the quarters the sky and the deep
being enveloped with the cloud of arrows shall become invisible. I shall
slay to-day all the heroic monkeys with my winged arrows. Ascending my
car gifted with the velocity of the wind shall I churn to day the monkey
host with arrow-like waves coming from the ocean-like bow. I shall like
an elephant distress to-day the monkey-like pools having their
countenances for the blown lotuses, and the lustre of their bodies for
the filaments. To-day in the encounter, the leaders of the monkey hosts,
with their heads transfixed with arrows, shall cover the earth, like
unto lotuses with their stalks. I shall to-day with a single arrow,
cleave hundreds of heroic monkeys fighting with trees in their hands. I
shall wipe to-day the tears of those whose brother or son has been slain
by destroying their foe. In the encounter to-day I shall, with the
monkeys deprived of their breath and clept with my arrows, so cover the
earth that it may not be seen by any. I shall satisfy to-day with the
flesh of the enemies slain by my shafts, the crows, vultures and others
who live upon flesh. Get ready soon my car and bring my bow. And let the
remaining night-rangers follow me in battle". Hearing his words
Mahaparsha addressed the leaders of the army who were near him,
saying,--"Get your soldiers ready". And the commanders too quickly went
round all the houses in Lanka and asked the Rakshasas to be ready soon.
Thereupon began to issue out in a moment terrible-looking Rakshasas,
emitting roars, having dreadful faces and with various weapons in their
hands--daggers, _Patticas_, maces, clubs, furrows, sharpened _saktis_,
traps, various rods, sharpened _chakra_, _parashwadhas_, _vindipalas_,
_sataghnis_ and various other excellent weapons. Thereupon at the
command of Ravana the commanders brought one _Nijuta_ (a hundred
thousand) cars, three _Nijuta_ elephants, sixty million horses, asses
and camels and numberless infantry. They arranged the soldiers before
the king and in the interval the charioteer brought the car--filled with
excellent celestial weapons--richly adorned, containing many an armour,
girt with a network of tinkling ornaments, crested with various jewels,
having jewelled pillars and a thousand golden jars. Beholding the car
the Rakshasas were greatly astonished. And Ravana, the lord of
Rakshasas, rising up all on a sudden, ascended that car, brilliant like
the flaming fire and the aggregate rays of a million sun,
quick-coursing, having a charioteer, drawn by eight horses, huge and
shining in its native lustre. Thereupon proceeded Ravana, encircled by
many a Rakshasa as if rending the earth with the excess of his prowess.
There arose a huge sound of bugles accompanied with that of Mridangas,
drums, conchs, and _kalapas_. The lord of the Rakshas--wicked, the
slayer of the Brahmins--the thorn of the celestials, and who hath
brought away Sita by stealth, has come with his umbrellas and chowries
to fight with the foremost of Raghus--this cry was heard everywhere. And
with his tremendous roar the earth shook. And hearing all on a sudden
that sound, the monkeys fled away in fear. And the highly effulgent
Ravana, having huge arms and surrounded by his ministers, came there
being certain of gaining victory. Being commanded by Ravana, Mahaparsha,
Mahodara and the irrepresible Birupaksha ascended the car. They,
desirous of winning victory, issued out emitting dreadful roars in
delight and as if rending the earth therewith. Thereupon the highly
effulgent (Ravana) resembling Death, with uplifted bow, sallied out for
battle along with the army of Rakshas. And that mighty car-warrior, went
out in his chariot drawn by quick-coursing steeds by that gate which led
to where Rama and Lakshmana were. Thereat the sun lost its
brilliance--the quarters were enshrouded with darkness; the birds sent
forth dreadful cries and the earth shook. The celestials poured down
bloody rains--the course of the horses was slackened--the vultures sat
on the banners and jackals emitted inauspicious cries, his left eye and
the left arm began to shake--his countenance became pale and his voice
grew harsher. The Ten-necked Rakshasa thus going out for battle there
appeared many bad omens indicating his destruction. From the sky fell a
fire-brand accompanied with the sound of thunder; vultures and crows
emitted inauspicious cries. Disregarding these dreadful omens which
appeared then, Ravana, incited by death, foolishly went out to slay his
(enemies). And by the wheel-sound of the chariots of the great Rakshasas
the host of monkeys calling each other, excited with anger and willing
to gain victory, addressed themselves for fight. Thereupon the
Ten-necked one, enraged, with his arrows feathered in gold, made a
dreadful slaughter of the army of monkeys. And some of those heroic
monkeys were beheaded by Ravana--some had their hearts rent and others
were shorn of their ears. Some had their breath choked, some were killed
and others had their sides broken. Some had their hands cut off and
others had their eyes put out. And wherever in the encounter, the
Ten-headed Rakshasa, whirling his eyes in ire, went in his car--the
monkey leaders could not stand the vehemence of his arrows.



SECTION LXLVII.


There the earth was covered with monkeys whose bodies were rent with the
arrows of the Ten-necked (Ravana). As the flies cannot stand before the
flaming fire so they could not bear the vehemence of Ravana's shafts.
Being thus assailed with pointed arrows they fled away crying, like unto
elephants being burnt by fire. And Ravana with his arrows pursued in
conflict the course of clouds. Thus slaughtering the monkeys the lords
of Rakshasas speedily reached in the encounter where Raghava was. And
beholding the monkeys assailed and afraid Sugriva placing Sushena in
charge of a _gulma_[385] addressed himself for the battle. And placing
that heroic monkey, his equal in prowess, in that command Sugriva
sallied out with a tree in his hand to meet the enemy. And followed him
on all sides the leaders of the monkeys with huge crags and various
trees. The heroic Sugriva emitted terrible roars in the conflict and
assailed the heroic Rakshasas and many others. The huge-bodied
monkey-chief crushed the Rakshasas like unto the wind uprooting the
trees at the time of dissolution. He began to make a downpour of crags
at the Rakshasa host like unto the cloud pouring down hailstorms at the
birds in the forest. And being beheaded by the crags discharged by that
monkey chief the Rakshasas fell down like unto mountains cleft. The
Rakshasas being thus attacked and shattered by Sugriva and roaring and
falling down on all sides, an irrepressible Rakshasa, skilled in
archery, by name Birupaksha, pronouncing his own name, got down from the
car and mounted an elephant. And mounted on the elephant that highly
powerful Birupaksha sent forth leonine roars and dashed against the
monkeys. Exciting the joy of the Rakshasas and removing their anxiety he
discharged dreadful shafts at Sugriva and his army. And being assailed
by the pointed arrows of that Rakshasa that lord of monkeys roared in
anger and made up his mind to destroy him. Thereupon uprooting a tree
the heroic monkey, skilled in warfare, leaped and struck that huge
elephant down in his presence. And being assailed greatly by Sugriva
that huge elephant proceeded a little within the range of the bow and
roared and died. And being; greatly enraged on the destruction of that
elephant the highly powerful Rakshasa dashed forward to face the enemy.
That one of quick movements took up his dagger and armour and viling,
approached Sugriva. And beholding his movement Sugriva took up a huge
crag resembling a cloud and hurled it against Birupaksha. That highly
powerful leading Rakshasa, finding the crag about to fall, turned a
little away and struck the monkey with his dagger. And being assailed
with dagger by that powerful Rakshasa the monkey remained senseless for
sometime on the ground. And rising up all on a sudden he, clenching his
fist, struck that Rakshasa in the mighty encounter on his breast and got
him down. Being struck with the fist the night-ranger Birupaksha greatly
enraged cut down with his dagger Sugriva's armour and tumbled him down
with his feet. And the monkey rising up again was about to deal him a
blow, hard as a thunder-bolt, with a dreadful sound. And receding a
little, he baffled its aim and returned one on Sugriva's breast. Finding
his aim baffled and himself struck in return by the Rakshasa, Sugriva,
the lord of monkeys, was excited with anger. And the monkey-chief was
now on the look-out for an opportunity to strike Birupaksha. And
immediately in anger he struck him down with a blow on his forehead. And
being thus assailed with the fist resembling the thunder-bolt of
Mahendra, he fell down on the earth bathed in a pool of blood. And blood
gushed out of the person of Birupaksha like unto water issuing out of a
fountain. And the monkeys beheld their enemy (Birupaksha) with his eyes
disfigured in anger, bathed in a foam of blood, his whole body
discoloured, trembling, rolling and crying piteously. Thereupon those
two armies of the monkeys and Rakshasas, being ready to engage in the
encounter, began to roar like unto two mighty oceans having their banks
broken. And observing that highly powerful Rakshasa, of discoloured
eyes, slain by the king of monkeys, the monkeys and Rakshasa forces

SECTION LXLVIII.


Like unto a pond in the summer both the armies became gradually reduced.
Beholding his own army and Birupaksha slain, Ravana, the lord of
Rakshasas, was doubly excited with ire. And observing his army reduced
and slain by the heroic (monkeys) he perceived ill omens in the fight
and was accordingly pained at heart. And he addressed Mahodara, who was
near him, saying, "O thou of great arms, all my hopes of success are now
centered in thee. Do thou slay the enemy's force, O hero, and display
thy prowess. Now hath come the time of returning the favours of thy
master. Do thou fight bravely". Being thus accosted that Rakshasa-chief
Mahodara, saying "so be it" entered the enemy's army like unto a fly
entering into a flame. Excited by his master's command and empowered by
his own prowess that (Rakshasa) gifted with great strength, began to
assail the monkeys. And the highly powerful monkeys too taking up huge
crags dashed against the dreadful army of the enemies and crushed all
the Rakshasas. And Mahodara, greatly angered, severed in that mighty
encounter, with his arrows feathered in gold, the hands, feet and thighs
of the monkeys. Then the monkeys, in fear of the Rakshasas, fled away to
different quarters and some sought shelter of Sugriva. And beholding his
powerful monkey force thus assailed in the conflict, Sugriva dashed
forward and fronted Mahodara. And taking up a huge and dreadful crag
resembling a mountain, the monkey-king hurled it with great vehemence to
slay him. Thereupon finding that crag about to fall, Mahodara fearlessly
severed it with his arrows. And being sundered into a thousand pieces by
the arrow of that Rakshasa, it fell down on the earth like unto a band
of vultures. And beholding that crag thus severed, Sugriva was beside
himself with ire; and uplifting a _sala_ tree hurled it: and the heroic
Rakshasa, the slayer of enemy's force, severed it into several pieces
with his arrows. Thereupon excited with wrath he saw a _parigha_ on the
ground. And hurling that flaming _parigha_ and displaying his
(light-handedness) he struck his excellent horse therewith. And having
his horse slain, that hero--the Rakshasa Mahodara, ascended his car, and
in great anger took up his club. Those two heroes, with club and
_parigha_ in their hands, engaged in battle, roaring like two bulls or
clouds accompanied with lightning. Thereupon the night-ranger Mahodara,
inflamed with ire, hurled at Sugriva, the club flaming like the Sun. And
beholding that dreadful club about to fall the highly powerful
Sugriva--the lord of monkeys, uplifting his _parigha_ struck it
therewith. And the _parigha_, being sundered, fell quickly down on the
earth. Thereupon the effulgent Sugriva picked up from the ground a
_musala_ made of iron and ornamented with gold. Taking that _musala_ up
he hurled it at the Rakshasa and who again hurled a club; and both of
them being severed fell down on the earth. Having their weapons baffled
thus, those two heroes, gifted with great prowess and effulgence and
resembling the burning fire, were ready to interchange blows. They,
emitting roars again and again, struck each other down on the earth with
their clenched fists. And rising up speedily they again assailed each
other. Thus those two heroes, unsubdued, struck each other with their
arms. Thereupon both of them, highly proficient in fighting with arms,
were greatly exhausted. Thereupon they took up daggers. And uplifting
them, (those two heroes) with their persons trembling in ire, proficient
in fighting and skilled in the use of weapons, dashed on roaring. And
both of them enraged with each other and anxious to score success,
moving in a circle on each other's right side, addressed themselves for
action. Thereupon the vicious-minded, heroic Mahodara, gifted with great
vehemence and proud of his own heroism, flung his dagger at (the
monkey's) armour. And as he was about to extricate his dagger from the
armour, that foremost of monkeys severed with his dagger that Rakshasa's
head with helmet and _kundalas_. And beholding the Rakshasa-chief fall
down on the earth with his head off, his forces fled away from the
field. And slaying him that monkey-chief, delighted, began to roar along
with other monkeys. There-upon the Ten-necked one became highly enraged
and Raghava greatly delighted. And all the Rakshasas, with their hearts
broken and countenances rendered poorly and stricken with fear fled away
to different quarters. Slaying and striking down on earth Mahodara like
unto a portion of a mighty hill severed, that son of the Sun appeared
resplendent in his own effulgence and became irrepressible like unto the
Sun. And winning victory in the action that lord of monkeys was espied
by the celestials, Siddhas and Yakshas along with all creatures on
earth, having their eyes flushed with joy.



SECTION LXLIX.


Mahodara being thus slain by Sugriva, the highly powerful Mahaparshwa,
having his eyes reddened with ire, looked towards him. And the Rakshasa,
with his weapons, assailed the dreadful army of Angada as well as the
leading monkeys. The Rakshasa severed the heads from the bodies of the
monkeys like unto the wind throwing away the fruits from trees. And he
cut off, with his arrows, the arms of some and some were deprived of
their sides. The monkeys were thus assailed by Mahaparshwa with a shower
of shafts. All the monkeys were thus stricken with grief and rendered
senseless. And hearing of the anxiety of his own army thus assailed by
the Rakshasa, Angada, gifted with great vehemence, taking his _parigha_
made of iron and resembling the rays of the sun, dashed on like the
rising deep during the lunar half of a month. And that foremost of
monkeys encountered Mahaparshwa, who, thus struck by the monkey, became
insensible with his charioteer and fell down on the earth. Thereupon
leaped on the battle-field the highly powerful and effulgent lord of
bears, having the hue of red collyrium, with his army resembling the
cloud. And excited with ire, he, taking up a huge crag resembling the
summit of a mountain, speedily struck down his horses and broke down his
car. And regaining his senses in a moment the highly powerful
Mahaparshwa, again assailed Angada with many arrows. He struck Jambavan,
the lord of bears, on his breast with three arrows and assailed Gabaksha
with many shafts. And beholding Jambavan and Gabaksha overwhelmed with
arrows, Angada, beside himself with ire, took up a dreadful _parigha_.
And holding with two hands that _parigha_ made of iron and bright like
the rays of the sun, Angada, the son of Vali, with his eyes reddened in
wrath, hurled it at Mahaparshwa who was stationed at a distance, to slay
him. And being hurled by the highly powerful (Angada) the _parigha_,
struck down from his hands the bow with arrows and the helmet of the
Rakshasa. And approaching him vehemently, Vali's son, gifted with great
prowess, in anger, struck him, with clenched fist, on his ears having
excellent _kundalas_. There-upon Mahaparshwa gifted with great vehemence
and effulgence, highly angered, took up in his hands a huge
_parashivadha_, sharpened with oil, bright and hard as iron and
discharged it at Vali's son, and struck him therewith on his left
shoulder. And Angada baffled that _parashwadha_. Thereupon that hero,
powerful like his own father, clenching his fist, hard as thunder-bolt
and resembling even Indra's _acani_, dealt it, in great anger, upon the
Raksha's breast. And being struck with that fist the Rakshasa's breast
was shattered and lie fell down on earth. He falling down on earth
slain, his soldiers were greatly sorry and Ravana attained to an excess
of ire in the conflict. The noise set up by the delighted monkeys like
unto a dreadful leonine roar, as if rending the city of Lanka abounding
in edifices and gates, resembled the great roar of the celestials along
with Indra. And hearing the noise of the celestials and monkeys, the
lord of Rakshasas, the enemy of the gods, in great anger, again
proceeded towards the battle field.



SECTION C.


Beholding Mahodara, Mahaparsha and the highly powerful Birupaksha slain
in the encounter Ravana attained to an excess of ire. And ordering his
charioteer to hurry on he gave vent to the following words--"All my
courtiers have been slain and my city is shut up--I shall remove my
grief consequent on all these by slaying Rama and Lakshmana. I shall
destroy Rama-like tree in the conflict whose flower is Sita and whose
branches are Sugriva, Jambavan, Kumuda, Nala, Divida, Mainda, Angada,
Gandhamadana, Hanuman and all other leading monkeys". And resounding the
ten quarters with the sound of his chariot wheels that mighty
car-warrior proceeded quickly towards Raghava. With that sound all
quarters were filled, and the earth, with rivers, mountains and forests
shook and all the lions, deer and birds were terrified. He created a
dreadful darkness with the discharge of his sharp weapons and burnt down
the monkeys who fled away to different directions. Dust was raised on
the ground by those monkeys assailed and flying to various directions.
They were unable to withstand the power of that weapon made by Brahma
himself. Beholding his own army, assailed and cut into hundred pieces by
the excellent weapons of Ravana, Raghava dashed forward. And assailing
the monkey-host, that foremost of Rakshasas espied Rama, unconquered, at
a distance with his brother Lakshmana like unto Basava with Vishnu,
holding a huge bow like one painted on the sky, having expansive eyes
like lotus-petals, long arms, and always subduing the enemies. Beholding
the monkeys slain in the encounter and Ravana approach, the heroic and
highly powerful Rama, with Sumitra's son in his company, delightedly set
arrows on his bow. And as if rending the whole earth with that dreadful
sound he began to draw the string of his excellent bow. With the sound
of Ravana's arrows and the twang of Rama's bow hundreds of Rakshasas
fell down on earth. And coming within the range of the arrows of those
two princes, Ravana appeared like Rahu in presence of the sun and the
moon. And desiring to fight with him first Lakshmana setting sharp
arrows on his bow, discharged shafts at him resembling the flame of
fire. And the highly powerful Ravana too with his arrows stopped the
course of those shafts in the sky as soon as they were discharged by
Lakshmana, skilled in archery. And displaying his light-handedness, he,
with one arrow, severed Lakshmana's one, with three his three and with
ten his ten. Surpassing thus the son of Sumitra, Ravana, ever victorious
in battle, confronted Rama in the encounter, standing like another hill.
And approaching Raghava, Ravana the lord of Rakshasas, with his eyes
reddened in ire, began to make a shower of arrows. Thereupon beholding
the arrows shot off Ravana's bow fall on all sides, Rama speedily took
up a _valla_.[386] And Raghava sundered with his sharp _valla_ his
dreadful arrows flaming and resembling poisonous serpents. With various
sharpened arrows Raghava assailed Ravana, and he again assailed Rama in
return. And forming a circle, they passed each other by the right side.
Uprooting the earth with the vehemence of their arrows, irrepressible by
each other, fighting equally discharging arrows, they looked dreadful
like Death himself--and created terror in all creatures. The sky was
filled with their various weapons, like unto clouds in the rainy season
accompanied with lightning. And the welkin appeared full of windows with
that shower of arrows, sharpened, shot with great vehemence and winged
like vultures. The earth was stricken with darkness caused by these
arrows like unto clouds appearing after sunset. There took place a
dreadful conflict between them, desiring to slay each other, having
their prowess unknown and fighting like Vitra and Vasava. Both of them
were proficient in archery, skilled in the art of conflict and foremost
of those conversant with the use of weapons. And they began to veer
round the battle-field. And wherever they went, there appeared arrows
like unto waves of the deep roused by the winds. Then that destroyer of
creatures--Ravana--with his hand engaged in discharging shafts, shot at
Rama's forehead a network of arrows. And thereat Rama on his head bore
that shower of shafts shot from his terrific bow, having the lustre of
the petals of blue lotuses; nor did he experience any pain, And then
reciting a formula, the exceedingly energetic Rama endowed with prowess,
wrought up with wrath, engaged in incessantly shooting his shafts,
taking his Raudra weapon and again seizing his arrows, discharged them
at that lord of Rakshasas. And alighting at the impenetrable hail of the
Kakshasa-chief, resembling a mass of mighty clouds, those arrows did not
then occasion him any pain. Again Rama skilled in all weapons, from a
powerful weapon discharged arrows at the sovereign of the Rakshasas
mounted on his car. And piercing Ravana, those like unto five-hooded
serpents, resisted by him, entered the earth, hissing. Having baffled
Raghava's weapon, Ravana, transported with passion, took up a dreadful
Asura weapon; and discharged sharpened shafts having the faces of lions
and tigers, and the faces of _kankas_ and _kokas_[387] and the faces of
vultures and hawks, and the faces of jackals, and the faces of
wolves,--with gaping mouths,--and terrific of aspect; five-mouthed and
red-hued. And that highly powerful one, enraged, sighing like a snake,
by his power of illusion shot at Rama other keen arrows having the faces
of mules and the faces of bears, and the faces of dogs and cocks, and
the faces of _makaras_[388] and venomous serpents,--these as well as
others. Covered with that Asura weapon, that foremost of the Raghus,
himself resembling fire, discharged an exceedingly vigorous weapon
informed with fire; and shot various shafts having faces filled with
live flames, and faces like unto suns,--and hued like unto planets and
stars,--and furnished with faces resembling mighty meteors, or
resembling tongues of lightning. And those terrific shafts of Ravana,
resisted by Raghava's weapon, were annihilated in the sky, and destroyed
(monkeys) by thousands. And seeing that weapon (of Ravana) destroyed by
Rama of untiring deeds, all those heroes, the monkeys--headed by
Sugriva, capable of wearing forms at will, shouted, surrounding Raghava.
And the high-souled son of Dacaratha--Raghava--having by his might
destroyed that weapon discharged by Ravana's arms, was delighted; and
the monkey-chiefs, filled with glee, began to emit shouts.

SECTION CI.


On that weapon of his having been baffled, Ravana--lord of the
Rakshasas--was fired with double fury, and the highly effulgent Ravana
from wrath set about discharging at Raghava a dreadful Raudra weapon,
which had been conferred on him by Maya. And from his bow began to issue
forth in large numbers darts and maces and clubs, flaming and having the
might of thunder; and various kinds of sharp clubs and daggers and
nooses and flaming thunderbolts began to descend like unto the winds at
the universal tumbling. And thereupon the graceful and exceedingly
effulgent Raghava--foremost of those accomplished in noble
arms--resisted that weapon with a powerful Gandharva weapon. On that
weapon being baffled by the high-souled Raghava, Ravana, with his eyes
rendered coppery with passion, took up a Solar weapon. Thereupon from
the bow of the wondrous vehement and intelligent Ten-necked one rushed
out discuses flaming and mighty. And the firmament all round blazed up
with those impendent (arms), as blaze up the cardinal quarters on the
Sun and the Moon and the planets dropping down. Thereat Raghava in the
van of that army by means of vollies of shafts cut off Ravana's
wonderful weapons and discuses. And seeing that weapon destroyed,
Ravana--lord of Rakshasas--with ten arrows pierced Rama all through his
vitals. And pierced by Ravana with those ten shafts discharged from his
mighty bow, the exceedingly powerful Raghava did not so much shake. Then
Raghava--victor in fight--waxing wondrous wroth, with countless shafts
pierced Ravana all over his person. In the meanwhile Raghava's younger
brother, the mighty Lakshmana--destroyer of foes--growing enraged, took
up seven arrows. And with those highly impetuous arrows that exceedingly
effulgent one severed the human-headed standard of Ravana. And the
mighty and graceful Lakshmana with a shaft cut off the head of the
Nairita's charioteer, illumined with ear-rings. And then with five
sharpened arrows Lakshmana severed the bow of the Rakshasa-chief,
resembling the trunk of an elephant. And Bibhishana, bounding up, with
his mace despatched Ravana's excellent steeds, resembling hills or
dark-blue clouds. Thereat, leaping down from his mighty car, whose
horses had been slain, Ravana was fired with high wrath against his
brother. And the powerful lord of Rakshasas endowed with immense
strength, hurled at Bibhishana a dart resembling the flaming
thunder-bolt. And ere the dart had reached its destination, Lakshmana
severed it with three shafts; and thereat in that mighty conflict there
arose a mighty uproar from the monkeys. And the dart dight with networks
of gold fell down in three fragments, as droppeth a mighty meteor from
the firmament, flaming and shooting out scintillations. Then (Ravana)
took up a huge dart, glowing in its own energy, celebrated as being
irrisistible, and incapable of being borne by the Destroyer himself. On
being whirled by the impious and strong Ravana, the dart possessed of
exceeding energy, flamed up. In the meanwhile the heroic Lakshmana
swiftly came to the side of Bibhishana,[389] whose life was placed in
peril. And in order to save him, that hero--Lakshmana--drawing his bow,
covered the dart-handed Ravana with showers of shafts. On being covered
with arrows shot by that high souled one, Ravana, with his prowess
baffled, made up his mind to let (his brother) go. And seeing his
brother delivered by Lakshmana, Ravana, facing Lakshmana, spoke these
words,--"O thou proud of thy prowess! as Bibhishana hath this wise been
delivered by thee, passing by the Rakshasa, this dart, discharged from
my bludgeon of an arm, will depart, depriving thee of thy life". Having
said this, Ravana, waxing furiously enraged, discharged at Lakshmana
that dart forged by Maya with his power of illusion, furnished with
eight bells, having mighty sounds,--incapable of being
resisted,--competent to finish foes; and flaming in energy,--and shouted
simultaneously. And hurled with terrific force, the dart sending sounds
resembling that of Vajra or the thunder-bolt, vehemently alighted at
Lakshmana in that encounter. Thereat, as the dart descended, Raghava
addressed[390] it, saying,--"Peace be to Lakshmana! Be thou frustrated;
and let thy energy go out of thee". But the dart discharged in the
encounter by the enraged Ravana, resembling a venomous serpent, dived
into the dauntless and heroic Lakshmana; and (the dart) exceedingly
splendid and blazing, possessed of dreadful impetuosity; and resembling
the tongue of the king of serpents, smote Lakshmana in his mighty chest.
And with his breast riven by the dart, driving deep through the force of
Ravana, Lakshmana fell down to the earth. And Raghava, standing by,
seeing Lakshmana in that plight, had his heart overspread with sorrow.
But reflecting only for a while, he, with his eyes surcharged with
tears, was filled with greater martial ardour, and resembled the fire
risen at the universal dissolution. Then thinking,--'This is not the
time to indulge in grief;' he, gazing at Lakshmana, entered into a
terrific encounter, resolved upon slaying Ravana, laying under
contribution his dearest energies. And Rama saw Lakshmana with his chest
riven by the dart in the mighty conflict, lying drenched in blood, and
resembling a hill with serpents present in it--And in spite of all their
efforts, the foremost monkeys failed to extract the dart which had been
hurled by the powerful Ravana.--And, further, they were (all the while)
sore assailed with showers of shafts by the foremost Rakshasa of them
all. The dart, having pierced Sumitra's son, had entered the earth. In
the encounter the mighty Rama, grasping the dreadful dart with his
hands, extracted the same and wrathfully snapped it.[391] As he (Rama)
was engaged in pulling the dart out, the mighty Ravana kept pouring
marrow-piercing shafts all over his person. Thinking nothing of those
arrows, Rama, embracing Lakshmana, spoke unto Hanuman and the mighty
monkey, Sugriva,--"Ye foremost of monkeys, do ye stay here, surrounding
Lakshmana. The opportunity for putting forth my prowess which I had
sought, is present. I shall slay this wicked-minded Ten-necked one, who
is resolved to pursue the course of unrighteousness. Even as on the
expiry of summer the Chataka is eager for the sight of clouds, I had
long been eager to obtain a sight of (Ravana.) Ye monkeys, this, I swear
unto you,--this very hour not long after ye will see this world without
Ravana or Rama. To-day having slain Ravana in battle, I shall renounce
all sorrow arising from the loss of my kingdom, from my sojourn in the
woods, from my wandering in Dandaka, from the ravishment of Vaidehi,
from encounter with the Rakshas,--all the terrible evils that I have
suffered, and all the troubles resembling hell. He for whom I have
brought over the monkey-forces, made Sugriva king, slaying Vali in
battle, for whom I have crossed the ocean and constructed a bridge over
the deep--the same hath been come at by me in conflict, and the same
hath come within the range of my vision.--And having come within my ken,
Ravana will not live, even as one coming within ken of a serpent of
poisonous sight, doth not live; or even as a serpent doth not live,
coming within ken of Vinata's[392] son. Do ye, ye irrepressible ones, ye
foremost of monkeys, seated at the brow of the mountain, behold the
battle between me and Ravana. To day let the three worlds with the
Gandharvas, and the Siddhas, and the Chiranas, see that for which Rama
is Rama. To-day I shall do a deed of which the worlds with the mobile
and the immobile and the gods, shall speak as long as the Earth
sustaineth (creatures.)" Having delivered himself thus, Rama,
concentrating his attention, began to charge the Ten-necked one in
encounter with whetted arrows decked with burnished gold. And in the
same way Ravana showered on Rama great _narachas_ and clubs, even as
clouds pour down showers. And there arose a tremendous uproar of mighty
arrows discharged by Rama and Ravana, smiting one another. And the
shafts shot by Rama and Ravana, severed and scattered, with flaming
heads dropped to the Earth. And the mighty twangs of the bow-strings of
both, terrifying all creatures, were wonderful to behold.[393] And then
even as clouds disperse on being trampled by the Winds, Ravana, covered
with showers of arrowy networks by that high souled one and reduced to
sore straits by that one (Rama) of a glowing bow, fled away in fear.

      was the Lord himself, having spoken to it as he did, it could not
      this time go back; and Rama snapped it, which none else could
      do.'!--T.

SECTION CII.


Seeing the heroic Lakshmana brought down by the dart discharged by the
powerful Ravana, and lying drenched in blood, he (Rama) after having
fought furiously with the wicked-minded Ravana,--and having showered
vollies of shafts, addressed Sushena, saying,--"This heroic Lakshmana
brought down to the earth by the prowess of Ravana, lieth like a
serpent, enhancing my sorrow. Seeing this hero, dearer to me than life,
what power have I, with my soul overwhelmed with dole, to fight? If this
brother of mine graced with auspicious marks, delighting in battle,
breathe his last, what shall life avail me or happiness? My prowess is
ashamed; my bow falleth off from my hand; my arrows droop; my sight is
dimmed with tears; my limbs weaken as do those of men in a dream;
thought racks me; and I even desire death". Seeing his brother wounded
by the wicked-minded Ravana, crying in preternatural accents, and sore
stricken in his vitals, (Rama) overcome by a mighty sorrow, lamented
with his senses wildered. "Seeing my brother, Lakshmana, wounded, and
lying over the dust of the field, even victory, O hero, doth not seem to
me sweet. If the Moon is hid from the sight, whom doth he then delight?
What have I to do with battle? What have I to do with life? I have no
more to do anything with fighting, seeing that this Lakshmana wounded,
lieth in the field of battle. As this highly effulgent one had followed
me into the forest, so will I in the same way follow him to the abode of
Yama. Ever seeking my welfare and ever devoted to me, he hath been
reduced to this pass by Rakshasas fighting in crooked ways. In land
after land one meets with wives, in land after land one meets with
friends, but country find I none where a uterine brother may be met
with. What, O irrepressible one, shall I do with the kingdom without my
Lakshmana? And what shall I say unto mother Sumitra, fond of her son?
And I shall never be able to bear the reproach Sumitra shall cast upon
me. And what shall I say unto Kaucalya, and what unto mother Kaikeyi?
And what shall I say unto Bharata, and what unto the exceedingly
powerful Satrughna? 'Thou hadst gone to the woods with him. Why then
dost thou come (back) without him?' 'Tis better (for me) to renounce my
life here, instead of bearing the censure of friends. What a sin had I
committed in another birth, seeing that my virtuous brother, staying
before me, hath been slain? Ah, my brother! Thou best of men! O master,
who wert the foremost of heroes! Why, forsaking me, dost thou repair to
the other regions. Wherefore, brother, dost thou not speak to me, who am
lamenting? Get up. See! Why dost thou lie down? Look on me with thine
eyes. O mighty-armed one, in the woods and mountains thou didst ever use
to cheer me, tried by grief and pining in despondency, with my mind
overwhelmed (with woe)". As Rama was speaking thus with his senses
overwhelmed with emotion, Sushena, soothing him, spoke these pregnant
words,--"O foremost of men, cast off this train of thought tending to
overwhelm thy understanding,--this anxiety giving birth to grief, and
resembling the shafts of foes in the van of the embattled forces.
Lakshmana enhancer of auspiciousness is not dead. His face is not
distorted or blackened. Do thou look at his countenance, which is
beautifully bright and cheerful. His hands have palms resembling
lotus-petals, and his eyes are pleasant. O king, one dead doth not look
thus. (Therefore), O hero, do not grieve. O subduer of enemies, this one
is instinct with life. As he is lying down on the ground, stretched at
length, his heart, O hero, trembling momentarily, testifieth to his
respiration". Having spoken thus unto Raghava, the highly wise Sushena
thus addressed the mighty monkey, Hanuman, saying,--"O placid one,
hieing hence to the mountain, Mahodaya, which, O hero, had formerly been
mentioned unto thee by Jambavan, bring hither the mighty drug sprung at
its right summit--Vicalyakarani by name, and Savarnyakarani,[394] and
Sanjivakarani, O hero, and the potent medicine--Sandhani. Do thou bring
(these) in order that the hero--Lakshmana--may be revived". Having been
thus instructed, Hanuman, repairing to the Medicinal mountain, was
wrought up with anxiety, not knowing the drugs. And then the thought
sprang up in the mind of the Wind-god's offspring of immeasurable
prowess,--"I shall go, even taking this (entire) summit of the mountain.
In this very summit must that delightful drug have sprung. This I infer,
inasmuch as Sushena had forsooth said so. If I fail to take
Vicalyakarani, I shall come by disgrace,--and if I spend much time (in
thought), that would be fraught with evil".[395] Having reflected thus,
the exceedingly powerful Hanuman, foremost of monkeys,--swiftly drawing
up to that best of mountains, and giving three shakes to the mountain
filled with various flowering trees,--raised it up with his hands. And
taking that summit of the mountain resembling dark-blue clouds charged
with rain, Hanuman from the earth bounded up into the sky. And arriving
(at his quarters), that wondrous vehement one, putting down the
mountain-peak, and reposing for a while, spoke unto Sushena,--"I did not
find the drug, O best of monkeys; and therefore have I brought this
entire summit of the mountain". When the Wind-god's offspring had spoken
thus, that foremost of monkeys--Sushena--praising him, uprooted the herb
and secured it. Seeing Hanuman's feat, incapable of being done by even
the celestials, the choicest of the monkeys were amazed. Then crushing
the healing herb, that best of monkeys--the exceedingly effulgent
Sushena, made Lakshmana smell the same. And thereupon the wounded
Lakshmana,--slayer of hostile heroes--smelling it, cured of his wound
and ailments, speedily rose up from the ground. Seeing Lakshmana rise up
from the earth, the monkeys, exceedingly rejoiced, honoring Lakshmana,
exclaimed, "Excellent! Excellent!" "Come!" said that slayer of hostile
heroes--Rama--and with his eyes filled with tears, he deeply embraced
Lakshmana. And having embraced Sumitra's son, Raghava then addressed
him, saying--"By good fortune it is that, O hero, I see thee returned
from (the mansion of) Death.--Verily my life, or Sita, or Victory is
worthless (without thee). And thou being dead, what is my life worth?"
When the high-souled Raghava had spoken thus, Lakshmana, aggrieved on
account of the words (of Raghava) expressive of infirmity of purpose,
said,--"Having bound thyself by that vow, it doth not, O thou having
truth for prowess, behove thee to speak like one fickle and feeble.
Those speaking the truth, never falsify their promise: the mark of a
great one is even observance of vow. O sinless one, do not suffer
thyself to be overcome by despair on my account. Do thou to-day by
slaying Ravana, make thy promise good. Thy foe coming within the sway of
thy shafts, will not hence, living, even like a mighty elephant coming
before a sharp-toothed roaring lion. I wish the speedy destruction of
this impious one, ere the maker of day, having performed his work, has
ascended the Setting-hill.[396] If thou wishest to slay Ravana in
battle, if thou desirest to recover the princess, then, O noble one, O
hero, to-day speedily set about what I say".

      commentator, on the first day of the lighted fortnight.--T.



SECTION CIII.


Hearing the words uttered by Lakshmana, that slayer of hostile
heroes--Raghava--endued with prowess, taking his bow, set shafts on it,
and in the brunt of battle began to discharge dreadful arrows at Ravana.
And mounted on another car, Ravana--lord of Rakshasas--rushed against
Kakutstha, even as Swarbhanu rusheth against the Sun. And even as a mass
of clouds poureth down torrents on a mighty mountain, the Ten-necked
one, mounted on his car, smote Rama with shafts resembling
thunder-bolts. And in the encounter Rama, concentrating his thoughts,
showered on the Ten-necked one arrows embellished with gold and looking
like living fire. And celestials and Gandharvas and Kinnaras declared
that there had been no other battle like unto the encounter of Rama
stationed on the ground and the Raksha mounted on his car. Then the
foremost of celestials--Sakra--hearing their ambrosial speech, summoning
Matali, said,--"Taking my car, hie to the best of the Raghus. And
reaching the earth, do thou, welcoming (him), bring about great good
unto the gods". Thus accosted by the sovereign of the celestials,
Matali--celestial charioteer--bending down his head, addressed that
celestial, saying,--"Speedily shall I go, O lord of the celestials; and
I shall also do the office of a charioteer (unto Raghava)". Then yoking
with steeds that best of cars, curiously wrought with gold; adorned with
hundreds of small bells; resembling the Sun new risen; having its pole
studded with lapises; yoked with excellent horses caparisoned in gold;
furnished with white chowris,--drawn by steeds resembling the Sun;
decked with golden net-works,--and provided with a golden standard,--the
graceful car of the sovereign of the celestials,--Matali, commanded by
the king of the immortals, ascending the car, went out of the celestial
regions and came to Kakutstha. And with his hand holding the reins, the
charioteer of the thousand-eyed (Deity) with joined hands addressed
Rama, saying,--"O Kakutstha, in order that thou mayst obtain the
victory, the thousand-eyed (god) hath sent thee this car. And, O
exceedingly powerful one! O graceful (hero)! thou that slayest thy foes!
this is the redoubtable bow of Indra,--and this is the mail resembling
fire,--and these are the arrows looking like the very Sun; and this is
the dart shining and fraught with fair fortune. Ascend thou this car, O
hero. Slay the Rakshasa--Ravana, with me as thy charioteer, even as the
lord of the celestials slayeth Danavas". Thus addressed, Rama, going
round the car and saluting it, ascended the same, illumining the worlds
with his splendour. And the encounter that took place between the two
cars with the mighty-armed Rama (on one side), and the
Raksha--Ravana--(on the other), was wonderful to behold. And Raghava
highly proficient in weapons with a Gandharva weapon resisted the
Gandharva weapon of the Rakshasa king, and with a celestial weapon, his
celestial weapon. And then that lord of Rakshasas--the
night-ranger--fired with high rage, again discharged an exceedingly
dreadful Rakshasa weapon. And the gold-decked shafts shot from Ravana's
bow, becoming furiously venomous serpents, covered Kakutstha. And
vomitting living flames, they of terrific aspect, having flaming faces,
showered over Rama with gaping mouths. And those flaming venomous
serpents, having the feel of Vasuki himself, covered all sides and
enveloped all quarters. And seeing those serpents descending in the
encounter, Rama employed a dreadful Garuda weapon. And discharged from
Raghava's bow, those arrows plated with gold at the feathered parts, and
furnished with the splendour of peacocks, becoming golden birds--began
to range (the field of battle) as the enemies of the serpents. And the
shafts of Rama capable of wearing forms at will, turned into birds,
destroyed all the exceedingly swift-coursing arrows having the forms of
serpents. On his weapon having been baffled, Ravana--lord of
Rakshasas--waxing Wroth, poured tremendous showers of shafts on Rama.
And smiting Rama of untiring deeds with thousands of shafts, (Ravana)
pierced Matali with vollies of arrows. And with an arrow, Ravana severed
the standard; and having brought down the golden standard on the floor
of the car, Ravana wounded even Indra's steeds with a net-work of
arrows. And seeing Rama hard pressed, celestials and Gandharvas, and
Charanas along with Danavas, and Siddhas, and the supreme saints were
overcome with sadness; and the foremost monkeys together with Bihhishana
were aggrieved. And seeing a Moon of Rama Chandra in the grasp of a Rahu
of Ravana, that bringer of evil unto creatures--Budha--stood, assailing
the Prayapatya star--Rohini--beloved of the Moon. And the enraged Ocean,
heaving with smoking surges, and flaming as it were, swelled up, seeming
to the touch the Sun. And the Sun was blackened and assumed a stern
aspect, with his rays dimmed. And he was seen with a headless trunk on
his lap, and he was in conjunction with a comet. And that star of the
Kocalas, relating to the deities--Indra and Agni--Angaraka--stood in the
sky, attacking Vicakha. And the Ten-necked one, having ten faces and
twenty arms, equipped with his bow, looked like the mountain--Mainaka.
And Rama reduced to sore straits by the Ten-necked Raksha, could not
discharge his arrows in the conflict. And then the enraged Rama with his
eyes slightly red, flew into a tremendous passion, as if burning up the
Rakshasas. Seeing the face of the enraged Rama endued with
understanding, all the creatures were overwhelmed with fear and the
Earth herself shook. And mountains abounding with lions and tigers began
to tremble, and trees to shiver. And even the deep--lord of streams--was
wrought up wondrously. And rough and terrific clouds in the sky sent
forth fierce roars. And stormy clouds rumbling went about the heavens.
And seeing Rama wrought up with a mighty passion, and the fearful
disastrous omens, all creatures were possessed by fright and Ravana was
struck with dismay. And then stationed in the sky, celestials and
Gandharvas and mighty serpents and saints and Danavas and Daityas and
those related to Garuda--fowls--beheld that conflict like unto the
universal tumbling, as the two heroes fought on with various dire arms.
And as they looked on the mighty encounter, the celestials and the
Asuras, who had come to the conflict, from feeling of regard[397]
cheerfully spoke (these words). And the Asuras staying there said unto
the Ten-necked one, 'Be victorious!' and the celestials again and again
said unto Rama, 'Be victorious!' In the meantime, the impious Ravana,
desirous of slaying Raghava, from wrath took up a mighty weapon, fraught
with the essence of the thunder-bolt; sending terrible sounds; capable
of destroying all foes,--furnished with forks resembling mountain-peaks;
tending to strike terror unto mind and sight; sharp-pointed, resembling
the smoking fire risen at the hour of universal dissolution; exceedingly
terrible; irrisistible (in battle); unbearable even by the
Destroyer,--the terror of all creatures--terrific; and competent to rive
(all things). Flaming up with wrath, Ravana took this dart. And fired
with furious wrath, that powerful one took the dart in the encounter,
surrounded in that contest by many heroic Rakshasas. And uplifting (the
dart), the huge-bodied Ravana, with his eyes reddened in passion,
emitted mighty roars. And the shouts of the Rakshasa sovereign made the
earth and the sky and the cardinal quarters and all sides tremble. And
at the roars of that wicked-minded and huge-bodied one, all creatures
were struck with terror, and the sea was vexed.[398] And the exceedingly
energetic Ravana, taking that mighty dart, and sending up furious
shouts, addressed Rama in a harsh speech, saying,--"O Rama, I in wrath
uplift this dart having the strength of the levin. This will utterly
deprive of life thee who art assisted by thy brother. O thou that
delightest in battle, to-day swiftly slaying thee, I shall make thee
even with those heroic Rakshas slain in the van of the forces. Stay now.
O Raghava, thee shall I slay with this dart". Saying this, the lord of
the Rakshasas hurled the dart. And discharged from Ravana's hand, (the
dart), surrounded with garlands of lightning, furnished with eight
bells, sending mighty roars,--rising to the sky, looked exceedingly
splendid. Seeing the dart, flaming and of terrific aspect, Raghu's
son--Rama--endowed with prowess, drawing his bow, discharged arrows. And
with vollies of shafts Raghava resisted the descending (dart), even as
Vasava extinguished the fire of doomsday with his showers. Then even as
a flame consumeth insects, the mighty dart of Ravana burnt up those
shafts shot from the bow of Rama. Seeing those shafts reduced to ashes
and crushed on coming in contact with the dart, as they were coursing in
the sky, Raghava was transported with passion. And then waxing wondrous
wroth,--Raghu's son--Raghava--took up a javelin, liked by Vasava
himself, brought by Matali. And on being wielded by that strong one, the
javelin, resonant with bells, made the welkin blaze up, like a burning
meteor on the occasion of universal rack. And when hurled, it alighted
on that same dart of the Rakshasa-chief. And thereat, with its splendour
lost, the mighty dart, riven, dropped (to the earth.) Then Rama,
shooting straight-speeding arrows, pierced his (Ravana's) exceedingly
fleet steeds. And then he pierced Ravana in the chest with whetted
arrows. And the energetic Raghava hit (Ravana) in the temples with three
feathered shafts. And thereat with all his limbs pierced (with arrows),
and his body laved in blood, the lord of Rakshasas furnished with many
limbs, looked like a flowering Acoka. And with his person pierced with
the shafts of Rama, the lord of night-rangers having his body drenched
with blood, was stricken with sadness in the midst of his forces,--and
was also overwhelmed with terrific wrath.

SECTION CIV.


On being greatly harassed by Kakutstha in anger, Ravana, delighting in
battle, came under the sway of a towering passion. And with his eyes
aglow, that powerful one from wrath and fury assailed Raghava in mighty
encounter. And even as clouds pour down from the sky on a pool, Ravana
showered thousands of arrows on Raghava. And covered with vollies of
shafts discharged from (Ravana's) bow in the conflict, Kakutstha like
unto a mighty mountain did not shake. And that one endowed with prowess
stood in the field, resisting those networks of arrows, and took up
shafts resembling the rays of the Sun. Then the fleet-handed
night-ranger, fired with rage, discharged a thousand arrows at the chest
of the high-souled Raghava.--And thereat in that encounter Lakshmana's
elder brother, with his body bathed in Mood, appeared like a mighty
Kincuka tree in a forest. And with his ire aroused by the blows he
received, the exceedingly energetic Kakutstha took up arrows resembling
the Sun risen at the time of the universal dissolution. And in the
darkness spread by the arrows (discharged), Rama and Ravana both fired
with wrath could not be discovered of each other. Then that
hero--Dacaratha's son--Rama, overcome with wrath, addressed Ravana,
laughing, in a harsh speech, saying,--"Thou vilest of Rakshasas, in
consequence of having through lack of sense carried off my wife from
Janasthana and brought her under thy subjection, thou hast been deprived
of thy prowess. Having forcibly carried away Vaidehi staying in that
mighty forest, forlorn and without me, thou thinkest--'I am a hero.'
Outraging the helpless wives of others,--doing this craven deed, thou
thinkest--'I am a hero.' O thou having thy dignity destroyed! shameless
wight! O thou of volatile character, having through thy violence brought
destruction on thyself, thou thinkest,--'I am a hero.' A great and'
famous act hath been performed by thee,--a hero, and the brother of the
Bestower of riches, surrounded with thy forces! To-day receive the
mighty fruit of that infamous act done through pride, productive of
evil.[399] O wicked-minded one, thou thinkest of thyself--'I am a hero;'
but thou that hast taken away Sita like a thief, hast no feeling of
shame. Hadst thou forcibly outraged Sita in my very presence, thou,
slain by my shafts, wouldst have seen thy brother--Khara. By luck, O
thou of an evil soul, thou hast come within the range of my vision.
To-day by means of sharp shafts shall I bring thee to death's door.
To-day beasts of pray will drag thy head having burning ear-rings,
severed by my shafts and covered with the dust of the battle-field. O
Ravana, vultures will alight on thy breast, as thou wilt lie low on the
ground; and, athirst, they will drink the blood gushing out from thy
wounds. To-day fowls of the air will keep pulling at thee pierced with
my shafts, and lying lifeless, as birds do serpents". Having spoken
thus, that slayer of foes--Rama--showered arrows on the lord of
Rakshasas, staying before. And the prowess and strength and spirits and
force of arms of Rama burning for the destruction of his foe, were
doubled. And all the Weapons[400] presented themselves before that one
cognisant of self; and the fleet-handedness of that exceedingly powerful
one increased immensely from exhilaration of spirits. Seeing all these
auspicious omens coming of themselves, Rama, finisher of Rakshasas, set
about smiting his foe more energetically than ever. And assailed with
stones by the monkeys and showers of shafts by Raghava, the Ten-necked
one felt his heart undergoing a revolution.[401] And when through the
stupifaction of his inner self, he could not discharge any weapon, or
draw his bow, or put forth his prowess, (Rama) did not persist in
smiting him. And the shafts and various arms discharged by him betokened
his death; and his last moments were present. And his charioteer,
driving his car, perceiving this, calmly took the car away from the
field of fight. And then, seeing the king shorn of prowess, and dropt,
his charioteer, struck with fear, swiftly turned away his dreadful car
having the clatter of clouds, and went away from the field of battle.

SECTION CV.


After gradually regaining his senses, Ravana, urged on by the force of
the Finisher, getting into a furious passion, with his eyes reddened in
wrath, addressed the charioteer, saying,--"O thou of perverse sense,
disregarding me as devoid of prowess, and incompetent, and bereft of
vigor,--as cowardly, light, nerveless and shorn of energy,--and as
divorced by the power of illusion and debarred by arms,--thou actest on
thine own understanding. Wherefore disregarding me, and not minding my
purpose, hast thou taken away my car from before the presence of the
enemy? O abject one! by thee have my long-earned renown and energy and
prowess and credit been brought to naught. In the very sight of an enemy
of renowned prowess, and one capable of being gratified with valorous
deeds, hast thou made me, burning for battle, look as if I were a
coward. As, O wicked-minded one, thou dost not even through
heedlessness, take the car to the field of battle, I infer for certain
that thou hast been bribed by the foe. The act that thou hast done, doth
not appear as that of a friend seeking our welfare; but to-day thou hast
acted like an enemy. If thou hast been maintained by me, if thou
rememberest my merit, do thou swiftly turn the car before my enemy has
departed". Thus admonished by him of slender sense, the charioteer
possessed of intelligence, humbly spake onto Ravana words fraught with
good,--"I am not afraid, nor stupified, nor have I been bribed by the
foe, nor am I negligent. And I have not forgotten thy affection or thy
good offices. And studious of thy welfare, I have saved thy fame; and
with a mind over-flowing with affection I have done (unto thee) this
unpalatable good. O mighty monarch, for this, thou shouldst not, like a
frivolous and base one, criminate me that am ever engaged in what is
good and dear unto thee. Listen! I shall render thee reason why I turned
away from the field the car, rushing like a river when the sea is
swelled up.[402] I knew that thou hadst been fatigued in consequence of
thy mighty exertions in the fight. And I could not perceive that thy
prowess then stood superior (to that of the foe).[403] And the steeds of
my car were worn out by carrying it; and they were battered, and
helpless, and perspired like kine in a shower. And bad omens fast sprang
up before us. And on these occurring, I perceived that things would go
against us. O thou endowed with exceeding might, a charioteer should be
conversant with season and place, with omens, and the expressions of
emotions; as also with depression of spirits, exhilaration, and grief.
And he should have a knowledge of low, level and uneven grounds, and the
time for conflict, and he should be able to perceive the shortcomings of
the enemy. And a charioteer mounted on a car, should know when to draw
near an enemy, when to turn away from him; when to stay; and when to
turn round from before the foe--all these (he should know). What I, for
bringing respite unto thee as well as the horses of the car, have done
by way of removing the terrific exhaustion, is proper. I did not, O
hero, turn away the car of my own sheer will. What I have done, O lord,
had been dictated by my affection for thee. Command me. What thou
sayest, O destroyer of foes; I will do every way, O hero, with my whole
soul". Thereat, well-pleased with the speech of the charioteer, Ravana,
eager for encounter, after praising him in various ways, said,--"O
charioteer, do thou swiftly take the car towards Raghava. Without
slaying his foe in fight; Ravana turneth not away (from the field)".
Speaking thus, Ravana--lord of Rakshasas--gave the charioteer on the car
an excellent ornament for the hand. Hearing Ravana's words, the
charioteer drove the car. And urged on by the speech of Ravana, the
charioteer drove on the steeds,--and in a moment the mighty chariot of
the Rakshasa chief appeared before Rama in the field of battle.

Then the revered Agastya, who, desirous of witnessing the fight, had
along with the deities come there,--seeing Ravana spent with the toil of
conflict, staying in the field plunged in thought, and stationed before
Rama for engaging in encounter,--addressed Rama, drawing near to him,
saying,--"Rama, Rama, O mighty-armed one, hearken to the eternal secret,
whereby, my child, thou wilt conquer all foes in
fight,--_Aditya-hridaya,_[404] sacred, capable of destroying all foes,
bringing victory--the recitation, enduring and indestructible,--and
supremely good; fraught with all welfare, removing every sin,--chasing
away anxiety and grief, bringing length of days; and excellent. Do thou
worship Vivacwata's offspring--the Sun--lord of the world, furnished
with rays,--who maketh people engage in work, and who is bowed down to
by deities and Asuras. This effulgent one, producing rays is instinct
with the spirits of all the deities; and he with his rays ruleth all
creatures--and the hosts of celestials and Asuras. This Sun is Brahma
and Vishnu and Siva and Skanda[405] and Prajapati,[406] and Mahendra and
Dhanada[407] and the Destroyer--Yama--and Soma[408] and the Lord of
waters; and the Pitris,[409] and the Vasus, and the Sadhyas[410] and the
two Acwinis[411] and the Maruts and Manu,[412] and the Wind-god and the
God of fire and the creatures and the Creator of life and the seasons.
And he is Aditya[413] and Savita[414] and Suryya[415] and Khaga[416] and
Pusha[417] and Gavastiman[418] and the Golden-looking and Bhanu[419] and
Hiranyareta[420] and Divakara.[421] And he is Haridacwa[422] and
Saltasrarchi[423] and Saptasapti[424] and Marichiman.[425] And he
subdueth darkness, and he is Sambhu[426] and Tashta[427] and
Martandaka[428] and Ancuman.[429] And he is Hiranyagarbha,[430]
Sicira,[431] and Tapana,[432] and Ahaskara[433] and Ravi,[434] and
Agnigarbha,[435] and Aditi's son,[436] and Sankha,[437] and
Siciranacana,[438] Byomanatha[439] and Tamabheda,[440] the one
proficient in Rik, Yajus and Sama; and Ghanavrishti,[441] and the friend
of the Apas,[442] and he that swiftly courseth in the Vindhya way. And
he is Atapi[443] and Mandali[444] and Mrityu.[445] And he is
Pingala,[446] and the destroyer of everything, and the Omniscient, and
he having the universe for his form,[447] and the exceedingly energetic
one, and the beloved of all, and that one lording it over all kinds of
actions. And he is the lord[448] of stars and planets and
constallations, and the origin of everything, and the one powerful
pre-eminently of powerful things[449]--and the one having twelve
forms.[450] I bow unto thee (having these forms and functions).
Salutation unto the Eastern mount and the mount of the West. Salutation
unto the lord of the stellar bodies and salutation also unto the lord of
day. Salutation and salutation unto him that bringeth victory, and the
joy that springeth up from victory; and unto him of yellow steeds.
Salutation, salutation, O thousand-rayed one; Salutation and salutation
unto Aditya. Salutation unto him that keepeth his senses under
subjection; Salutation and salutation unto the Hero,[451] and unto
Saranga[452] and unto him that awakenest the Lotus.[453] And
(salutation) unto thee, O fierce one. Salutation unto the Lord himself
of Brahma, Icana[454] and Achchyuta,[455] and unto Sura[456] and unto
him that constitutes the knowledge of Aditya, and unto him that
unfoldeth me and not-me; and unto the devourer of all, and unto the form
of the destroyer of the darkness of ignorance, Salutation unto the
destroyer of darkness, and unto the destroyer of enemies, and unto him
of immeasurable Soul, and unto the destroyer of the ingrate, and unto
the deity, and unto the lord of all stellar bodies. And salutation unto
him that boasteth of the splendour of burning gold, unto the destroyer
of all mental obscurity,--and unto the maker of the universe. Salutation
unto the remover of darkness; unto the illuminator of the Soul; unto the
all-beholding one of all the worlds. The lord createth everything and
verily destroyeth it. And with his rays he sucketh up, and destroyeth
and createth (everything). When all are asleep, this one waketh, and he
is resident in the hearts of all creatures. This one is both Agnihotra
as well as the fruit reaped by the sacrifices thereof. And he
constitutes the gods and the sacrifices and the fruit also thereof; and
he is the lord of all acts that are performed by creatures. If a person
recites this (hymn), he, O Raghava, doth not come by misfortune, when he
is in peril of his life, or is ill, or in a lonely place, or in fear. Do
thou, with concentration, worship this god of gods, this lord of the
universe. By reciting (this hymn) instinct with the three virtues, thou
wilt obtain victory in battle. This very instant, O mighty-armed one,
thou wilt conquer Ravana". Having said this, Agastya went whither from
he had come. Hearing this, that exceedingly energetic one had his grief
gone, Then, well pleased, Raghava, exerting himself, contemplated (the
hymn). And reciting this, he beholding the Sun, attained excess of joy.
And sipping water again and again, and becoming purified, that powerful
one, taking up his bow, and viewing Ravana, advanced with a delighted
heart, to obtain victory. And he became intent on his death with his
dearest energies. Then exceedingly delighted, and filled with
rejoicings, the Sun, in the midst of the celestial hosts knowing that
the destruction of the Sovereign of the night-rangers was at
hand,--spoke unto Rama "Bestir thyself".

Then the charioteer fully drove with speed Ravana's car, capable of
bringing down the hosts of foes, resembling in form a city of the
Gandharvas, having elevated streamers, yoked with surpassingly superb
steeds, engarlanded in gold; stocked with war-like implements; furnished
with ensigns and standards; appearing to devour the welkin; making the
earth herself resound; destructive to hostile hosts; and filling its own
party with delight. And as it speedily descended, the monarch of men
beheld that Rakshasa-king's resounding car, having huge standards, yoked
with black chargers, and endowed with fierce splendour; as if flaming in
the firmament; having the resplendance of the Sun himself; with
thronging lightning pennons; displaying the glow of Indra's weapon;[457]
showering arms; and resembling rain-charged clouds. Seeing the enemy's
car resembling a mass of clouds having a chatter resembling the sounds
sent by a cleaving mountain rived by the thunder, Rama, vehemently
drawing his bow curved like the infant moon, addressed
Matali--charioteer unto the thousand-eyed (deity),[458] saying,--"O
Matali, behold the enraged chariot of my foe as it courseth on. From the
furious speed with which he is again wheeling at my right, it appeareth
that he hath set his heart on slaying me in encounter. Do thou therefore
heedfully drive the car right against the vehicle of my foe. I wish to
destroy this one even as the wind scattereth clouds that have appeared.
Do thou with all thy wits about thee, without trepidation, and holding
thy heart as well as thy eye in calmness, swiftly drive the chariot
ruled by the reins. Worthy of Purandara's car, thou ought not to be
taught by me. Desirous of encounter and my whole soul bent on fight, I
simply remind thee--not teach thee". Pleased with these words of Rama,
the excellent celestial charioteer--Matali--drove the car. Then leaving
Ravana's mighty car on the right, he enveloped Ravana with the dust
raised by the wheels. Thereat the Ten-necked one, enraged, with his eyes
coppery and dilated (in passion), covered with arrows Rama staying in
front of his car. Enraged at the smiting, Rama, with his ire aroused,
but summoning up patience, took up in the encounter the bow of Indra
endowed with exceeding vehemence; as well as highly impetuous shafts
having the resplendance of the solar rays. And then there began a
furious encounter between those (two) eager for slaying each other;
confronting each other like unto flaming lions. And then desirous of
destruction of Ravana,--celestials with Gandharvas, and Siddhas and
supersaints assembled to go to behold the encounter taking place between
the two cars. And for the destruction of Ravana and the success of
Raghava, there occurred round about the cars terrible bodements capable
of making people's down stand on end. The god poured down showers of
blood on the car of Ravana; and a violent tornado eddied on his right.
And a mighty swarm of vultures, wheeling in the heavens, pursued the car
wherever it moved. And Lanka was enveloped with evening resembling the
red _java_ flowers and even in day appeared ablaze. Lightnings and
firebrands accompanied by a terrible sound began to fall down on all
sides. And beholding these omens inauspicious unto Ravana all the
Rakshasas were greatly sorry. And wherever Ravana moved the earth shook
and the hands of all the Rakshasas fighting were as if paralysed. The
copper coloured, the yellow, the red, and the white rays of the sun
falling before Ravana appeared like melted metals of a mountain. And the
jackals followed by vultures, vomitting forth fire and casting their
looks at him, began to emit inauspicious cries. And in that battle-field
the unfavourable wind began to blow raising dust and obstructing the
vision of the king of Rakshasas. On the Rakshasa host on all sides
dreadful lightnings were showered without the sound of the clouds. All
the quarters were enshrouded with darkness and the welkin became
invisible being covered with darkness. And setting up a dreadful quarrel
hundreds of terrible _Sharikas_[459] began to fall down on his chariot.
The horses emitted forth sparks of fire from their hips and tears from
their eyes. These and various other dreadful omens arose there
announcing the destruction of Ravana. And there appeared on all sides
many an auspicious and good sign intimating the approach of Rama's
victory. And beholding all those auspicious marks announcing Rama's
success, Lakshmana was greatly delighted and considered Ravana as slain.
Thereupon beholding all those auspicious signs, Raghava, well qualified
to decipher them attained an excess of delight and became anxious to
display a greater prowess.

SECTION CVIII.


Thereupon there ensued a mighty and dreadful encounter of two cars
between Rama and Ravana, creating terror unto all people. And the army
of Rakshasas and the mighty host of the monkeys, although they had
weapons in their hands, became stupified (for the time being). And
beholding them (Rama and Ravana) fight, all the Rakshasas and monkeys,
having their minds agitated, were greatly surprised. With various
weapons and hands uplifted for fight, they, greatly wondered, stood
there beholding them and did not address themselves to fight with each
other. The Rakshasas beholding Ravana, and the monkeys beholding Rama
with wonder-stricken eyes, the whole army appeared like a picture. And
espieing all omens Raghava and Ravana began to fight, undaunted, firm,
resolute and unagitated by anger. And determining that Kakutstha would
win victory and Ravana would die, they began to display their own
prowess. Thereupon the highly powerful Ravana, setting his arrows in
anger, discharged them at the pennon stationed on Raghava's car. Those
arrows reaching the flag staff of the Purandara chariot and perceiving
its might fell down on the earth. Thereupon the highly powerful Rama,
wroth, stretching his bow, made up his mind to return the blow. And
aiming at Ravana's flag staff he discharged a sharpened shaft flaming
unbearably by its own lustre like a huge serpent. And the effulgent Rama
discharged a shaft aiming at (Ravana's) banner which, piercing the
Ten-necked demon's flag fell, down on the earth. And beholding his flag
staff thus broken down the highly powerful Ravana became ablaze as if
burning down every tiling with his unbearable ire And being possessed by
wrath he began to make a downpour of shafts. Ravana then, with flaming
arrows, pierced Rama's steeds. The celestial horses were not bewildered
thereby nor their course was slackened. And they remained thoroughly
unagitated as if they were stricken with lotus stalks. Beholding the
steeds thus unmoved Ravana was again exercised with wrath and began to
discharge afresh his various weapons--_gadas_, _parighas_, _chakras_ and
_musalas_, mountain tops, trees, darts and _parashus_ and thousands of
other shafts by virtue of his illusive powers. And unmoved was his
energy. And that downpour of various weapons became huge and terrible in
the conflict creating terror and making a dreadful noise. Thereupon
leaving aside Raghava's car he began to assail the monkey-host and
enveloped the sky with a continual discharge of arrows. The Ten-necked
demon let loose many a weapon even at the risk of his own life. And
beholding Ravana in the encounter thus actively engaged in the discharge
of arrows, Kakuthstha, smiling, set up pointed shafts, and discharged
them by hundreds and thousands. Beholding them Ravana again filled the
welkin with arrows--and thus with shafts discharged by them both another
flaming sky was created. None (of the arrows) missed the aim, none of
them failed to pierce another and none of them was fruitless. And the
arrows discharged by Rama and Ravana stricking each other fell down on
the earth. And they standing on their right and left began to make a
continued downpour of arrows and enveloped the sky entirely. And they
opposing each other, Ravana slew Rama's steeds and Rama in his turn slew
Ravanan's. They, thus enraged fought with each other and for sometime
there ensued a terrible encounter capable of making ones down stand on
end. And the highly powerful Ravana and Rama[460] righting with each
other in the conflict by means of sharpened arrows, the lord of
Rakshasas beholding his flag staff broken down became enraged with the
foremost of Raghus.

[460] The epithet in the text is Lakshmana's elder brother.



SECTION CIX.


Rama and Ravana thus opposing each other in battle, all the animals
beheld them, stricken with astonishment. And those two great heroes,
highly angered, began to dash towards and assail each other; and being
determined to slay each other they looked greatly dreadful. And their
charioteers drove the cars on, displaying their skill by moving in
circles, in rows and diverse other ways. And those two excellent heroes,
discharging their shafts and influenced by illusions, assailed each
other proceeding and receding, Rama attacking Ravana and Ravana
withstanding him. And these two cars coursed the earth for sometime like
clouds accompanied by showers. And displaying many a movement in the
conflict they again stood facing each other, the forepart of one car
touching that of the other and the heads of the steeds touching each
other; and the pennons, stationed on one touched those of the other.
Rama, with four sharpened arrows, shot off his bow, removed the flaming
horses of Ravana to some distance. And finding his steeds thus removed
he was exercised with wrath. And the Ten-necked one discharged sharpened
arrows at Raghava. And he was pierced by those arrows coming from the
powerful Ten-necked demon. He was neither overwhelmed nor pained
therewith and he again discharged arrows resembling the thunder-bolts.
And the Ten-necked demon again discharged arrows at the charioteer,
which fell with great vehemence on the person of Matali. Matali was not
the least pained or overwhelmed in that encounter. And beholding his
charioteer thus assailed Rama was excited with wrath and overwhelmed his
foe with a net of arrows. And the heroic Raghava showered on his enemy's
chariot shafts by twentys, thirtys, sixtys, hundreds and thousands. And
the lord of Rakshasas, Ravana, who was stationed on the car, wroth,
attacked Rama in the conflict with maces and _Musalas_. And there again
ensued a terrible conflict capable of making one's down stand on end.
And the seven oceans were overwhelmed with the sound of maces,
_musalas_, _Parighas_ and gold feathered arrows. And those inhabiting
the regions under the agitated oceans, all the Danavas and thousands of
_Pannagas_ were greatly pained. And greatly shook the earth with her
mountains, forests and gardens. The Sun was shorn of its resplendance
and the wind blew very rough. Thereupon the celestials, with
_Gandharbas_, _Siddhas_, great saints, _Kinnaras_ and serpents were all
worked up with anxiety. And beholding the dreadful encounter between
Rama and Ravana capable of making people's down stand on end, the
celestials with ascetics began to pray,--"May good betide the Brahmins
and cows, may people live in peace and may Raghava defeat Ravana, the
lord of Rakshasas, in the conflict". And the crowd of _Gandharbas_ and
_Apsaras_ beholding that wonderful battle between Rama and Ravana,
said,--"The ocean resembleth the sky and the sky resembleth the
ocean--forsooth this encounter between Rama and Ravana befits them
only". Thereupon Rama of long-arms, the enhancer of the glory of Raghu's
race, enraged, set his arrow, resembling a serpent, on his bow, and cut
assunder Ravana's head wearing shinning _Kundalas_. And that head in the
presence of the inhabitants of the three regions fell down on the earth.
Instantly there arose another head resembling the former; and it was
speedily cut off by the light-handed Rama. As soon as the second head
was chopped off in the encounter by means of shafts another appeared
again. And that was again severed by Rama's shafts resembling
thunder-bolts. And thus were severed hundred heads all equal in
brilliance. But the end of Ravana's life was not seen by him. Thereupon
the heroic Raghava, conversant with the use of all weapons, the enhancer
of Kaucalyi's joy, began to reason within himself in various
Ways,--"Verily these are the arrows by which Maricha was killed, and
Khara with Dushana was slain--Viradha was destroyed in the forest of
Krauncha--the headless demon in the forest of Dandaka--Salas and
mountains were broken--the ocean was agitated--and Vali was killed;--I
do not perceive the reason, why they are becoming fruitless when
discharged at Ravana". Thinking thus Raghava made himself ready In the
conflict and began to shower arrows on Ravana's breast. Thereupon Ravana
too, the lord of Rakshasas, seated in a car and highly enraged, assailed
Rama in the conflict with a downpour of maces and _Musalas_. That
dreadful and huge conflict, capable of making hairs stand on end,
continued for seven nights before the eyes of the celestials, Danavas,
Yakshas, Pisachas, Uragas and serpents stationed in the sky, on the
earth or on the mountain-tops. Neither for the night nor for the day,
nor for a moment did the fight between Rama and Ravana cease. And
beholding the conflict between Dacaratha's son and the lord of
Rakshasas, and Raghava's victory, the high-souled charioteer of the lord
of the celestials spake speedily unto Rama engaged in the conflict.



SECTION CX.


Thereupon Matali, reminding him, spake unto Raghava--"Why dost thou, O
hero, as if not knowing, fear him? Do thou, O lord, discharge at him the
weapon obtained from the great Patriarch. The time for (his)
destruction, as described by the celestials, hath arrived". Being
reminded by those words of Matali, Rama took up the flaming shaft,
breathing as if like a serpent. The great Rishi Agastya first conferred
this upon him. This is a huge and dreadful shaft given by Brahma, and
highly useful in battle. It was made by Brahma of undecaying prowess for
Indra and conferred by him upon the Lord of celestials desirous of
acquiring victory. In its wings there is wind, in its head there is fire
and the Sun, in its body there is the sky and in its weight there are
the (hill) Meru and Mandara. It is resplendent by its own lustre, well
feathered and adorned with gold--made of the essence of all objects and
bright as the rays of the Sun. It is like the fire of dissolution
enveloped in smoke--like the flaming serpent, capable of piercing men,
serpents and horses and was swift-coursing. (It can) rend the gateways,
_Parighas_ and hills--is soaked in blood, dipped in marrow, and
extremely dreadful. It is hard as the lightning--producing a dreadful
sound, assailing various (divisions of the) army, creating terror unto
all, dreadful and (as if) breathing like a serpent. It is terrible as
the Death in the conflict and provides food always for the herons,
vultures, cranes, jackals and the Rakshasas. It is the enhancer of the
monkey-leaders' joy and the repressor of the Rakshasas and is feathered
like unto a bird with many a picturesque wing. And the highly powerful
Rama, consecrating in accordance with the _mantras_ laid down in the
Vedas, that huge shaft--the foremost of all in the world, removing the
fear of the Ikshwaku race, destroying the fame of the enemies and
conducing to the joy of its own party, set it on his bow. And that
excellent arrow being mounted on his bow by Raghava all the animals were
stricken with fear and the earth shook. And (Rama) highly enraged, and
greatly wary, suppressing (his breath) discharged that shaft at
Ravana--piercing to the vitals. (That Brahma weapon) irrepressible as
the thunder, dreadful as the Death and discharged by Rama, fell down on
Ravana's breast. And that shaft, capable of bringing about death and
gifted with velocity, when discharged, cleft the breast of the
vicious-souled Ravana. And that body-ending arrow, bathed in blood,
stealing away the life of Ravana, entered the earth. That shaft, slaying
Ravana, soaked in blood and successful, again entered the quiver[461]
humbly. And from his hand, who was deprived of his life, fell down
instantly on earth his shafts and bow. And fell down on the earth from
the chariot, the highly effulgent Ravana, gifted with dreadful velocity
and shorn of his life. And beholding him thus fallen down, the remaining
night-rangers, deprived of their lord and stricken with terror fled away
to various quarters. And beholding the destruction of the Ten-necked
(demon) and the victory of Raghava, the monkeys, fighting with trees,
pursued them on all sides. And being assailed by the monkeys and having
their countenances full of tears in consequence of their lord being
slain they fled away to Lanka in fear. Thereupon the monkeys being
greatly delighted roared out the victory of Rama. The celestial bugle
was sounded in the sky and there blew the excellent air carrying the
celestial fragrance. Flowers were showered upon Rama's car which was
covered therewith. The celestials in the sky began to chaunt the glory
of Rama and praise him. And Ravana, the dread of all people, being
slain, the celestials with the _Charanas_ were greatly delighted. And
slaying that foremost of the Rakshasas, Rama satisfied the desire of
Sugriva, Angada and Bibhishana. Thereupon the celestials attained their
peace, the quarters were delighted, the atmosphere was clear, calm air
began to prevail all over the earth, and the Sun appeared in its full
rays. Thereupon Sugriva, Bibhishana and Lakshmana, welcomed Rama, of
unmitigated prowess, singing his glory. And there appeared beautiful at
the battle-field Rama of firm promise, slaying his enemy and encircled
by his army and friends, like unto the Lord of the celestials surrounded
by the gods.

SECTION CXI.


Beholding his brother defeated, slain and lying down on the
battle-field, Bibhishana, overpowered with the weight of his grief,
began to lament--"O hero, well-known for thy prowess, wise and
conversant with polity, thou wert used to excellent beds, why dost thou
lie down on the earth, spreading (on the earth) thy long and actionless
arms, always adorned with _Angadas_ and being shorn of thy helmet having
the resplendance of the Sun? O hero, thou hast come by what I had
anticipated and what did not please thee who wert possessed by
delusions. Prahasta, Indrajit, Kumbhakarna, Atikaya, Atiratha,
Narantaka, yourself and others--none of you paid heed, out of
haughtines, to what I had said which hath now been brought about. Oh!
the bridge of the pious hath been broken, the figure of the virtue hath
been spoiled, the refuge of the strong and powerful hath disappeared and
thou hast attained to the state of the heroes! The sun hath fallen down
on the earth, the moon hath been shorn of its lustre, the fire hath been
extinguished and virtue hath desisted from its action, this hero, the
foremost of those using weapons, falling down on the earth. O thou the
foremost of the Rakshasas lying down in the dust on the battle field
like one asleep, whom else have these remaining (Rakshasas) deprived of
their power and energy, got? The huge tree, of the lord of Rakshasas,
having patience for its leaves, velocity for its flowers, the power of
asceticism and heroism for its firm roots, hath been uprooted by the
_Raghava_ wind. Mad-elephant-like Ravana, having prowess for its tusk,
family rank for its back bone, anger for its legs, and delightedness for
its trunk, hath been laid low on the ground by the lion of the Ikshwaku
race. The powerful Rakshasa-fire, having prowess and energy for its
rays, angry breath for its smoke, own strength for its power of burning,
hath been extinguished in battle by _Rama-*like cloud. The Rakshasa bull
ever defeating others and powerful as the wind, having Rakshasas for its
tail, hump and horns, and fickleness for its ears and eyes, hath been
slain to-day by *Rama_-tiger". Hearing these words, pregnant with sound
reasonings from Bibhishana and beholding him overwhelmed with grief Rama
said,--"(This lord of Rakshasas) of dreadful prowess hath not been slain
in battle disabled. He is gifted with great prowess and energy and
devoid of the fear of death.[462] The heroes abiding by the virtues of
the Kshatriyas, who fall at the battle field for enhancing their glory,
when dead, should not be mourned for. This is not the time to mourn for
him although possessed by death, by whom gifted with intellect, Indra
with the three worlds was terrified in conflict. Besides success in
battle is not perpetual; either one slays his enemy or meets with his
destruction at his hands in the conflict This procedure of the Kshatryas
was laid down by the ancient preceptors that a Kshatrya, when slain in
battle should not be mourned for. Beholding this to be certain and
attaining calmness, do thou be freed from thy sorrow and think what
should be done now. Thereupon Bibhishana stricken with grief addressed
the powerful son of the king speaking thus with words tending to his
brother's well-being. "Thou hast, like the ocean breaking down its
banks, broken him down, who had not been ere this even defeated by
Basava and the celestials. By him were conferred many a gift on those
who wanted them, were enjoyed many a luxury, were maintained many a
servant, distributed wealth unto friends and slain the enemies. He
propitiated fire, performed great austerities, was conversant with the
Vedas and the great performer of sacrifices. I desire to perform, by thy
instructions, his becoming obsequies". Being thus addressed by
Bibhishana with piteous accents, the high-souled son of the lord of men,
gifted with great energy, ordered him to perform his obsequies and said.
"With death our enmity hath terminated and our object hath been
accomplished: he is as dear unto me as unto thee: perform (therefore)
his funeral rites".

[462] _i.e._ he has accidentally met with death.



SECTION CXII.


Beholding Ravana slain by the high-souled Raghava Rakshasees, stricken
with grief, issued out of the inner appartments. Stricken with grief and
with dishevelled hairs they rolled in the dust albeit prevented again
and again like unto cows separated from their calves. And coming out by
the northern gate along with the Rakshasas, entering the dreadful arena
of battle and searching their slain lord the she-demons cried
piteously--"O lord, O husband, O our all" and moved along the battle
field soaked in blood and filled with headless corpses. With eyes full
of tears and overwhelmed with the grief of their husband they began to
move about like she-elephants without the lord of their herd. Thereupon
they beheld there on the earth the huge-bodied and the highly powerful
and effulgent Ravana slain like red collyrium. And beholding their lord
lying down on the battle-field they all fell on his body like creepers
torn assunder. Some wept embracing him respectfully--some holding his
feet and some placing themselves around his neck. And some taking up his
hand rolled on the ground and some were beside themselves (with grief)
beholding the slain (Ravana's) countenance. And some placing her head on
his lap, and beholding his face, wept, bathing it with tears like a
lotus enveloped with snow. Seeing their husband Ravana thus slain on the
earth, they stricken with grief, bewailing again and again in sorrow,
wept profusely. He by whom the king Vaisrabana was deprived of his
flower car, who terrified the high-souled Gandharbas, ascetics and the
celestials in battle field, who did not know of any fear from the
Asuras, celestials and the Pannagas, hath now been overpowered by a man.
He, whom the celestials, the Danavas and the Rakshas could not slay,
hath been slain in conflict by a man walking on foot. He, who was
incapable of being killed by the celestials, Yakshas and Asuras, hath
met with death like one devoid of prowess at the hands of a mortal".
Speaking in this wise, the she-demons, over-powered with sorrow, wept
and bewailed again and again (saying),--"Not hearing (the counsels) of
thy friends, always pointing out thy welfare, thou didst bring Sita for
thy destruction as well as that of the Rakshasas. Although thy brother
Bibhishana addressed thee with words pregnant with thy welfare--thou,
for thy own destruction, out of thy misgivings, didst excite his anger
and hast (now) seen (the result thereof). Hadst thou returned Sita the
daughter of the king of Mithila to Rama, this mighty and dreadful
disaster, destroying the very root, would not have befallen us. Rama's
desire would have been encompassed--his friends would have been
successful (through Bibhishana)--we would not been widowed and our
enemies would not have got their desires fulfilled. By thee, Sita was
kept by force in captivity in a ruthless manner, and the Rakshasas,
ourselves and thyself--all three equally have been slain. O foremost of
the Rakshasas, forsooth this is not thy own folly--it is Accident that
uniteth all things and it is Accident again that bringeth about
destruction. O thou of huge arms--the destruction of the monkeys and the
Rakshasas as well as that of thyself hath been brought about by
Accident. When the course of accident is about to bring about
result--wealth, desire, prowess or command--nothing is capable of
with-standing it". Thus wept piteously the wives of the lord of
Rakshasas like unto so many she-elephants--rendered poorly, stricken
with grief and with tears in their eyes.



SECTION CXIII.


The foremost of the wives of the Rakshasa (king) bewailing piteously
cast her looks poorly towards her husband. And beholding her Ten-necked
husband slain by Rama of inconcievable actions Mandodari bewailed there
piteously,--"O thou of huge arms! O younger brother of Baishravana! Even
Purandara feared to stand before thee when enraged. The great
Rishis--the far-famed Gandharbas and the _Charanas_, fled away to
different quarters in thy fear. And then (how) hast thou been
overpowered in battle by Rama who is a mere man? Why is it that thou art
not ashamed of it, O king, O lord of the Rakshasas? Conquering the three
worlds with thy prowess thou didst attain thy glory; and it is
unbearable, that a man, ranging in the forest, hath slain thee. Thou,
who art capable of assuming shapes at will, hast been slain in conflict
by Rama, in the city of Lanka unapproachable by men. I do not believe
that thy destruction,--who hadst always been crowned with success,
before the forces, is work of Rama. (Methinks) Death (himself) came
there in the shape of Rama and spread illusions unconsciously for thy
destruction, O thou of great strength. Or thou hast been slain by
Vasava--(no) what power has he got to face thee in the conflict gifted
with great strength, prowess and energy and an enemy of the celestials
as thou art? It is evident that the great ascetic Vishnu, having truth
for his prowess--the soul of all beings, ever existing, without
beginning, middle or end, greater than the great, the Preserver of the
Nature, holding conch, discus and club, having _Sribatsa_[463] on his
breast, always beautiful, incapable of being conquered, without
destruction, devoid of end, and the lord of all men, assuming this shape
of a man and encircled by the celestials, assuming monkey shapes, hath
for the behoof of mankind, slain (thee) the dreadful enemy of the gods
with all (thy) family and Rakshasas. Subduing all thy passions, thou
didst conquer the three worlds--remembering their grudge they have now
over-powered thee. Rama is not a man since he slew at Janasthana thy
brother Khara encircled by many a Rakshasa. We were sore-distressed when
Hanuman, by his own prowess, entered the city of Lanka, incapable of
being approached even by the celestials. And I prevented thee from
creating enmity with Raghava, but thou didst not pay heed to my words
and this is the result (thereof). O foremost of Rakshasas--thou of a
vicious understanding, for the destruction of thy wealth, thyself and
thy relatives, thou didst suddenly cherish amour for Sita, greater than
(even) Arundhuti and Rohini. Forsooth thou didst perpetrate an
unbecoming deed by distressing the adorable Sita ever devoted unto her
lord, an earth[464] even unto Earth herself and a Sree[465] even unto
Sree herself. And having brought in a false guise from the solitary
forest the sorrowful and chaste Sita, having a blameless person, thou
didst bring on the destruction of thy family. Thou didst fail to
encompass thy desire for the company of Sita. But now, forsooth, O my
lord, thou hast been burnt down by her devotion who is devoted unto her
husband.[466] Thou wert not burnt down when thou didst captivate that
middle-statured (damsel) whom fear all the celestials headed by Indra
and _Agni_.[467] O husband, (proper) time appearing the perpetrator gets
the result of his vicious deeds: there is not the least doubt in this.
The performer of the good receives good (result)--the perpetrator of the
vicious (deeds) meets with bad (result). Bibhishana hath attained to
happiness and thou hast met with this thy end. There are damsels in your
seraglio far more beautiful than she but thou possessed by cupid couldst
not perceive this. Maithilee is not my equal nor superior either in
birth, beauty or accomplishments, but thou didst not perceive this by
thy misgivings. Death doth not always visit all men without any
cause--and Maithilee is the cause of thy death. And death, in
consequence of Maithilee, hath taken thee far away. And she, shorn of
all sorrow, shall enjoy in the company of Rama, and I, of limited piety,
am now sunk in the the ocean of grief. Roaming at large with thee in a
car unequalled in beauty on the hill Kailaca, Mandara, Maru, in the
garden of Chaitraratha and ail other celestial gardens, beholding many a
country, wearing variegated clothes and garlands, I have been deprived
of all pleasures and enjoyments, O hero, by thy death. And I am a widow
now. O fie on fickle fortune! O king, in lustre of countenance thou art
like the Sun, in grace like the Moon, in beauty like the lotus; thou art
graceful, O thou having excellent brows; thou hast got excellent skin,
high nose and thy countenance is graced with a brilliant crown and
_Kundalas_. Oh how beautiful, thou didst look with various garlands when
thy eye whirled with intoxication on the drinking ground and how
beautiful were thy smiles, O lord. Thy countenance doth not shine
now--being severed with Rama's shafts, bathed in a pool of blood, having
thy back-bone and brain deranged and covered with the dust raised by the
wheels of the chariots. Alas! by my ill-luck I have attained to that
after state making me a widow which I did never think of. My father is
the king of Danavas, my husband the lord of Rakshasas, and my son the
subduer of Sakra. I was greatly proud of this and always confident that
my protectors were undaunted, dreadful, repressors of the enemies and
famous for their strength and manliness. O ye foremost of the Rakshasas,
how could this fear from man overwhelm you all who were so powerful?
(This thy body) is cool, green like _Indraneela_, high like a huge
mountain, and adorned with _Keyura_, _Angada_, jewels and garlands of
flowers. It was graceful in places of enjoyments and incapable of being
looked at in the field of battle. It was brilliant, being decked with
ornaments like unto clouds accompanied by lightnings. And this thy
person hath been pierced with shafts to-day; (and knowing) that it is
not easy of attainment for me I am incapable of embracing (it), covered
with shafts piercing through the very vitals. O king (this thy body)
green-hued (but now) blood-red is now lying on the ground like unto a
mountain shattered with thunder-bolts. That thou wouldst be slain by
Rama was like a dream, but it hath proved true! Thou wert like death
unto Death himself, why hast thou been possessed by him then? Thou wert
the enjoyer of the three worlds' wealth and dread unto them; thou wert
the conqueror of the deities presiding over various quarters; thou didst
shake Sankara (himself)--thou wert the subduer of the proud and thy
prowess was well-known; thou didst repress the people and slay many a
pious man--thou didst, by thy prowess, use to give vent to haughty words
before the enemies; thou wert the maintainer of thy kinsmen and servants
and the slayer of many perpetrating dreadful deeds; thou wert the
destroyer of thousands of celestials, Danavas and Yakshas; thou wert the
subduer of _Nivata Kavachas_ in the encounter; thou didst hinder the
performance of many sacrifices and wert the protector of thy relatives;
thou wert the obstructer of pious observances, creator of illusions in
conflict and thou didst bring away from hither and thither the daughters
of the celestials, demons and men; thou didst aggrieve the wives of thy
enemies; thou wert the leader of thy own men, the protector of the
island of Lanka and the performer of many a dreadful deed; thou didst
confer upon us the enjoyment of many a pleasure--and wert the foremost
of car-warriors. Beholding such a husband slain by Rama, I am, deprived
of my dear lord, still maintaining my being; (forsooth) my heart is very
hard. O lord of Rakshasas, used ere to many a valuable bed, why art thou
sleeping on earth covered with dust? When my son Indrajit was slain by
Lakshmana in conflict I was greatly pained--but to-day I am slain.
Deprived of my friends and relatives, separated from thee O my lord,
deprived from the enjoyment of many pleasures I shall lament for thee
perpetually. Thou hast, O king, reached the way, long and hard to be
treaded--do thou take me, who am stricken with grief and who shall not
be able to live without thee. Why dost thou wish to go leaving me behind
who have been rendered poorly? Why dost thou not welcome me, unfortunate
and poor, who am bewailing? Why art thou not angry, lord, beholding me,
having put off my veil, walk out on foot by the city-gate? O beloved of
thy wives, do thou behold thy wives--who have thrown off their veils.
Why art thou not angry seeing them all come out (of the city)? I was thy
companion in sports, my lord; I long for having thee; why art thou not
consoling and welcoming me? O king, being imprecated by those damsels,
not one, devoted to their husbands, pious and ever engaged in attending
upon their superiors, who had been widowed by thee, thou hast been
overpowered by thy enemy. The carte, proceeding from them who had been
ill-treated by thee, hath borne fruit. O king, the saying, that the
tears of chaste damsels do not uselessly fall on the ground, hath been
verified (here) forsooth. O king, conquering the worlds with thy
prowess, how couldst thou, always honored by the king, cherish the vile
desire of stealing away women? Taking away Rama and Lakshmana from the
hermitage by an illusionary deer, thou didst steal away Rama's spouse. I
remember to have never heard thee lament in battle. Forsooth, it is our
misfortune and the sign of impending death (that thou didst do this)
conversant as thou art with the past, present and future. Beholding the
daughter of the king of Mithila brought (in the city of Lanka) what, thy
younger brother Bibhishana, thinking and sighing, said, hath now proved
true, O thou of long-arms. This destruction of the leading Rakshasas
hath proceeded from the disaster arising from thy anger and lust. For
thy (vicious) deeds all our good fortune is lost--(and from them) hath
proceeded the great disaster exterminating the race. And by thee all the
Rakshasa families have been deprived of their lords. Thou, well-known
for thy strength and manliness, art not worthy of being grieved by me.
On account of my effeminate nature my understanding is possessed by
sorrow. Carrying thy pious and iniquitous deeds thou hast attained to
thy own state--I am only lamenting for me who have been sorry for thy
destruction. O Ten-necked one, thou didst not bear the words of thy
friends and brothers, who spoke those well meaning words out of
affection. Thou didst not obey the words uttered by Bibhisana, duly and
mildly, pregnant with meaning and reasoning and tending to thy welfare.
Maddened with thy own prowess thou didst not hear the words of Maricha,
Kumbhakarna as well as those of my father--and this is the result
thereof. O thou resembling the red clouds, O thou wearing yellow cloth
and excellent _Angada_, stretching thy person on the ground why art thou
in the long run bathed in blood? Why dost thou not, like one asleep,
welcome me who am stricken with grief? I am the grand-daughter of the
highly powerful Rakshasa Sumali who never flies away from the field of
battle: why dost thou not welcome me? Rise up! rise up! why dost thou
lie down (on this occasion of) new discomfiture? To-day have the rays of
the Sun entered fearlessly the city of Lanka. The Parigha, by which,
brilliant as the rays of the Sun, thou didst distress the enemies in
conflict, which was always adored by thee like the thunder of the
wielder of thunder-bolt, which slew many in battle, and which was
adorned with golden nets, now lieth shattered into thousand pieces by
arrows. Why dost thou lie on the battle-field embracing her like your
beloved spouse? Why dost thou not wish to welcome me like one not
beloved unto thee? Oh fie on this heart of mine which is not sundered
into thousand (pieces) albeit distressed with the grief of thy death!"
Bewailing thus, she, with profuse tears in her eyes, and with her heart
overflowing with affection, became senseless. And being beside herself
she flung herself on Ravana's breast, like unto the bright lightning
appearing on red evening clouds. Thereupon the other wives, of Ravana,
greatly distressed and weeping, and raising her up who was greatly
weeping, began to console her saying:--"Dost thou not know, O worshipful
dame, that the life of beings is very uncertain, and with adverse
circumstances even the royal fortune becometh fickle?" Being thus
accosted she again wept aloud, bathing with tears her breast and
beautiful countenance. In the meantime Rama said to Bibhisana,--"Do thou
perform the funeral ceremonies of thy brother and console his wives".
Whereto the intelligent Bibhisana replied with the following
words--pointing out wealth and piety, and judging by his understanding
what is proper. "I do not think it proper to perform his cremation
ceremony who had renounced all pious deeds, was wicked, cruel, liar and
who had ravished others' wives. He is my enemy in the shape of a brother
ever engaged in doing injury unto others--and Ravana is not worthy of my
adoration albeit he is adorable by virtue of his being my elder brother.
O Rama, perhaps people of this earth will call me cruel but they will
again recognise my act as good when they will hear of his vicious
deeds". Hearing those words, Rama, the foremost of the pious and
conversant with the skill of speech, greatly delighted, spoke unto
Bibhishana (equally) skilled in speech,--"It behoveth me to encompass
thy welfare since by thy help I have gained the victory. O lord of
Rakshasas, forsooth, thou shouldst hear my well-meaning words. Although
this night-ranger perpetrated many vicious and impious deeds, still he
was ever powerful, heroic and strong in warfare. I have heard that this
high-souled Ravana, gifted with strength and a dread unto all people,
was not defeated (even) by the celestials headed by the performer of a
hundred sacrifices. Enmity extendeth up to death--so it hath ended;
there is no necessity (of carrying it on). Do thou (therefore) perform
his cremation ceremony--he is unto thee as he is unto me. O thou of
long-arms it behoveth thee to perform, speedily with due rites and
religious ceremonies, his funeral ceremony--thou shalt be the object of
praise (unto people)". Hearing the words of Raghava, Bibhishana hastened
on and began to make arrangements for the cremation of his slain brother
Ravana. And entering the city of Lanka, Bibhishana, the lord of
Rakshasas, speedily got out Ravana's _Agnihotra_,[468] carts, brass
utensils, fire, (and brought) _Jajakas_,[469] sandal-wood, other woods,
essences, _Agura_, other fragrant substances, precious stones, pearls
and corals. Thereupon arriving immediately accompanied by Rakshasas and
Malyavana he engaged in the performance of cremation ceremony. Thereupon
the twice-born ones, with tears in their eyes, covered the Rakshasa-king
Ravana's body, with a silken cloth and placed it on a golden celestial
litter. With the sound of various bugles they began to chaunt his
praise. And taking up this litter adorned with various charming
paintings and flags and carrying fire woods, all the Rakshasas headed by
Bibhishana proceeded towards the South.[470] The Brahmins, versed in
_Yayur Veda_ and with burning fire in their hands, proceeded and were
followed by the attendants. And the damsels of the seraglio followed
speedily leaping (being ever unused to walking). And placing Ravana on
the cremation ground, they, greatly stricken with grief, prepared the
funeral pyre according to due rites with sandalwoods, _Padmakas_,[471]
_Ushiras_[472] and sandal and spread an antelope-skin thereon. They
(then) performed the excellent obsequies of the manes of the lord of
Rakshasas. And raising an altar at the south-east corner they placed
fire at the proper place. They then poured curd and clarified butter
upon (Ravana's) shoulders. And placing _Sakata_ on his legs,
_Ulukhala_[473] on his thighs, and the brass untensils, Arunis and
Musals in their proper places, they celebrated (the obsequies of his
manes). Thereupon slaying beasts according to the rites laid down in
_Sastras_ and pointed out by the great saints, the Rakshasas (made a
coverlet dipped in their marrow and clarified butter) and placed it on
the face of the lord of Rakshasas. And decking Ravana with fragrant
garlands and various clothes, the friends, of Bibhishana, with depressed
heart and tears in their eyes, showered dried paddy (on his person). And
Bibhishana according to due rites put fire to his (funeral pyre).
Bathing and with wetted cloth, offering duly linseed and sacrificial
grass mixed with water and consoling (Ravana's) wives again and again,
he entreated them to go back. They then entered the city. And those
damsels having entered the city, Bibhishana, the lord of Rakshasas,
approaching Rama, stood by his side gently. And Rama too, along with his
army, Sugriva and Lakshmana, was greatly delighted after slaying his
enemy like unto the wielder of thunder-bolt after slaying (the demon)
Vitra. Thereupon leaving aside his bow with arrows, and the huge armour
conferred by Mahendra and renouncing ire after the destruction of his
enemy Rama assumed gentle mein.

Beholding the destruction of Ravana the celestials, Gandharbas and
Danavas ascending their respective cars went away chanting this
excellent theme. And talking of Ravana's dreadful destruction, Raghava's
prowess, the excellent warfare of the monkeys, the counsels of Sugriva,
the devotion and prowess of the Wind-God's son and Lakshmana and Sita's
devotion unto her husband, those high souled ones, delighted, repaired
to their respective quarters. And Raghava, having long arms, permitting
the charioteer to take back the celestial car bright as the sky sent by
Indra, honoured him greatly. And being commanded by Raghava Matali, the
charioteer of Sakra taking the celestial car, rose up in the welkin. And
that charioteer rising up into the celestial region, Raghava, the
foremost of car-warriors, greatly delighted, embraced Sugriva. And
embracing Sugriva, bowed unto by Lakshmana and worshipped by the monkey
he repaired to the camp of his soldiers. Thereupon Kakutstha spoke unto
Lakshmana--the son of Sumitra gifted with auspicious marks who was near
him--"O gentle one, take this Bibhishana to the city of Lanka ever
devoted and attached unto us, and who had done us good. This is my great
desire that I may behold Bibhishana the younger brother of Ravana
installed on the throne of Lanka". Being thus addressed by the
high-souled Raghava, the son of Sumitra, saying--"So be it" and greatly
delighted, brought a golden jar. And placing that jar at the hands of
the lord of monkeys, that one, gifted with great energy, ordered them to
bring water from the Ocean. And repairing speedily those excellent
monkeys came back with water from the ocean. And taking that jar and
placing him on an excellent seat Saumitri with that water sprinkled
Bibhishana as king of Lanka in the presence of all the Rakshasas, at
Rama's command. And (Lakshmana) encircled by friends sprinkling him
according to rites laid down in the Vedas, all the Rakshasas, devoted
unto him, his counsellors and the monkeys attaining incomparable
delight, sang the glory of Rama. And beholding Bibhishana the lord of
Rakshasas installed in the city of Lanka, Raghava along with Lakshmana
attained to an excess of delight. And consoling his subjects he went to
Rama. And the monkey citizens, delighted, brought him curd, fried grain,
sweetmeats, fried paddy and flowers. And taking all those things
indicating auspiciousness, he, irrepressible and gifted with energy,
conferred them upon Raghava and Lakshmana. And beholding Bibhisbana
crowned with prosperity and success, Rama accepted them, all for his
satisfaction. Thereupon Rama spoke unto the heroic monkey Hanuman,
resembling a a mountain and standing before him humbly with folded
hands, saying--"O gentle one, obtaining permission from the king
Bibhishana, do thou enter the city of Lanka and enquire after Maithili's
welfare. Do thou, O foremost of monkeys, inform Vaidehi of the
destruction of Ravana in conflict after communicating unto her mine
health as well as that of Lakshmana and Sugriva. O lord of monkeys, it
behoveth thee to return with the tidings of Vaidehi after informing her
of this pleasant news.



SECTION CXV.


Being thus commanded, Hanuman, the son of Maruta, worshipped of the
night-rangers, entered the city of Lanka. Entering the city with
Bibishana's permissiom, Hanuman, again permitted, entered the Briksha
Vatika.[474] And entering there duly, the monkey, who was already known
to Sita, espied her, having her person not cleansed, like Rohini,
oppressed by Rahu, sitting at the foot of a tree, devoid of joy and
encircled by she-demons. And approaching her and bowing unto her, he
stood there humbly and unmoved. And beholding the highly powerful
Hanuman arrived there the worshipful dame stood silent for sometime and
then recognising him became greatly delighted. And beholding her gentle
countenance, Hanuman, the best of monkeys, began to relate unto her what
Rama had said--"O Vaidehi, it is all well with Rama, Sugriva and
Lakshmana. He hath enquired after thy welfare. He hath accomplished his
end subduing his enemies--and his enemy is slain. O worshipful dame, the
powerful Ravana hath been slain by Rama, helped by Bibhishana and
accompanied by the monkeys and Lakshmana. I do relate unto thee this
pleasant news, O worshipful dame; I do again delight thee; it is by thy
grace, O thou conversant with piety, O Sita, victory hath been gained.
Do thou be consoled and relieved of thy anxiety. The enemy Ravana hath
been slain and the city of Lanka, hath been brought under submission.
(Rama said),--'For discomfitting thy enemy a bridge was constructed over
the sea by me who was determined and who did not sleep (for days) and
thus my promise hath been fulfilled. Do thou not be afraid for living in
Ravana's abode for I have placed at Bibhishana's hands the sovereignty
of Lanka. Do thou be consoled thinking as if that thou art living in thy
own house. To behold thee, Bibhishana, delighted, shall soon proceed".
Being thus accosted the worshipful Sita, having a moon-like countenance,
and her voice choked in delight, could not utter any thing. And
beholding Sita incapable of replying the foremost of monkeys
said,--"What art thou thinking of, O worshipful dame? Why art thou not
welcoming me?" Being thus addressed by Hanuman, Sita, ever treading the
paths of morality, greatly delighted, replied with words suppressed by
tears. "Hearing this pleasant news concerning the victory of my
husband--and being brought under the control of joy I am speechless for
sometime. O monkey, I do not perceive any such thing which I can confer
upon thee, in return, for this pleasant news. I do dot see any such
thing on this earth which can match thy pleasant tidings and bestowing
which upon thee I may be happy. Silver, gold, or diverse jewels or the
kingdom of the three worlds--nothing is a becoming return for thy
speech". Being thus addressed by Vaidehi the monkey replied--folding his
hands with delight and stationed before Sita,--' O blameless damsel,
forsooth this excellent speech becometh thee, who is ever engaged in the
welfare of thy husband and ever desirous of his victory. I do consider,
O worshipful dame, these words of thine, far greater than the wealth,
jewels or even the sovereignty over the celestials. Forsooth I have
gained the kingdom of the celestials and other things since I have
beheld Rama slay his enemy, victorious and peaceful. Hearing those words
of (Hanuman) Maithili the daughter of king Janaka spoke unto the
Wind-god's son far more excellent words--"Thou art capable of speaking
words, chaste, pleasant and significant of eight sorts of knowledge.
Thou art the praise-worthy son of the Wind-god and greatly virtuous;
strength, prowess, heroism, knowledge of _Sastras_, noble-mindedness,
energy, forgiveness, patience, endurance, humility and many other
excellent qualities crown thee". Thereupon not being elated the least,
he again, humbly folding his hands with delight and stationed before
Sita, said--"If dost thou permit me I may slay all these she-demons who
had tortured thee before, distressed thee in the forest of Acoka,
stricken with grief of thy lord, and who are cruel, have grim eyes and
who perpetrate always dreadful deeds. O worshipful dame, I have heard
that these grim-visaged she-demons distressed thee greatly with harsh
words at the command of Ravana. I desire to slay all these dreadful,
crooked, ugly (she-demons) having fearful eyes, meting out unto them
various punishments. I wish to slay all these she-demons, who had used
harsh words and had always offended thee, stricking them with fists,
fingers, arms, dreadful knee-joints, teeth, chopping off their ears and
noses, and pulling them by their hairs: do thou confer upon me this
permission. O far famed lady, I shall slay them by these various means,
by whom, dreadful as they are, thou hadst been distressed before". Being
thus addressed by Hanuman, she, ever kind unto the poor, thinking and
meditating, said to him--"O foremost of monkeys, why art thou angry with
these she-slaves, who subject as they are to the command of their lord,
have done this in accordance with another's order. For my adverse
fortune and vicious deeds perpetrated in another birth I have been
subject to such a plight and been suffering the consequence thereof. Do
thou not speak thus, O thou of huge arms. Such is the course of Fortune.
Forsooth by my ill-luck I have met with (this misfortune). I forgive,
out of pity, all these she-servants of Ravana; they used to torture me
at the command of that Rakshasa. And he being slain they shall not
repress me any longer, O son of the Wind-god. Do thou, O monkey, hear of
a _Sloka_, related in a _Purana_ and pregnant with religious import,
which was uttered by a boar to a tiger. 'No one taketh upon himself the
iniquity of a perpetrator of vicious deeds. So it behoveth the pious
crowned with an excellent character to observe the rules (of piety). So
it is proper to show compassion even upon those who perpetrate crimes
and are worthy of being slain. Who is there who doth not commit a crime?
It is not proper to act cruelly even by them who take delight in killing
men, although they commit various iniquitous deeds.'" Being thus
addressed by Sita, Hanuman, skilled in speech, spoke unto the blameless
Rama's spouse, saying--"Thou art the worthy spouse of Rama, religiously
wedded and crowned with many qualities. Permit me, O worshipful dame, to
proceed where Raghava is". Being thus accosted by Hanuman, Vaidehi, the
daughter of king Janaka, said,--"I wish to see my lord, ever fond of
those who are devoted unto him". Hearing these words, the high-minded
Hanuman, the son of Maruta, pleasing Maithili said--"Thou shalt behold
Rama, having a countenance like the full moon, with Lakshmana,
surrounded by his friends and having his enemies slain as Sachi
beholdeth Indra the king of the celestials". Addressing these words unto
Sita appearing like Sree herself the highly effulgent Hanuman returned
where Raghava was. Thereupon Hanuman, the foremost of monkeys, related
duly all what did the daughter of king Janaka say unto Raghava
resembling the lord of the celestials.

Thereupon bowing unto Rama, the foremost of bow-men, having eyes
resembling lotus-petals, the highly wise monkey said,--"It behoveth thee
now to see Maithilee, stricken with grief for whom thou didst initiate
all these works and the fruit whereof hath now been attained. Hearing of
thy victory Maithilee, possessed by grief and having eyes full of tears,
expressed her desire to see thee. And I was told by her, confident of
her previous trust, with profuse tears in her eyes,--"I wish to see my
husband". Being addressed by Hanuman, Rama the foremost of the pious
being bathed in tears, engaged instantly in meditation. Thereupon
sighing hard and casting his looks upon the ground he spoke unto
Bibhishana resembling clouds, who was near him. "Do thou speedily bring
Sita here--the daughter of the king of Mithila--bathed, sprinkled with
celestial paste and adorned with celestial ornaments". Being thus
addressed by Rama, Bibhishana hastened on and entering the inner
appartment sent information unto Sita through the female attendants. And
beholding the great Sita, the graceful lord of Rakshasas--Bibhishana,
humbly and placing his joined palms on his crown, said,--"O Vaidehi, may
good betide thee; sprinkled with celestial paste and adorned with
celestials ornaments do thou ascend this car; thy husband wisheth to see
thee". Being thus addressed Vaidehi replied unto Bibhishana,--"O lord of
Rakshasas, without bathing even I wish to see my husband". Hearing those
words Bibhishana replied,--"It behoveth thee to do what thy lord Rama
hath said". Whereto the chaste Maithilee, regarding her husband as God
and filled with devotion unto her husband, replied saying "So be it".
Thereupon placing Sita, bathed, performing the due rites wearing
valuable clothes and adorned with valuable ornaments, on a palanquin,
carried by many a capable Rakshasa, brought her (unto Rama). Thereupon
approaching the high-souled Rama, who, being informed of (Bibhishana's
approach) was engaged in meditation, Bibhishana bowing down and
delighted communicated unto him the arrival of Sita. And hearing of her
arrival who had lived long in the abode of the Rakshasa Raghava, the
slayer of enemies attained (simultaneously) to anger, delight and
depression. And considering Sita, who was in the patanquin, over-whelmed
with grief, Raghava delighted addressed Bibhishana with the following
words. "O lord of Rakshasas, O gentle (king), O thou ever engaged in
encompassing my success, do thou speedily bring Vaidehi nearer to me".
Hearing these words of Raghava, Bibhishana, conversant with piety
speedily cleared (the people out of that place). And attendants with
armours and head-dresses on and with cane and drums in their hands began
to move about driving away the crowd thereform. And the crowds of bears,
monkeys and Rakshasas being driven on all sides began to fly at a
distance. And they being thus driven there arose a huge noise resembling
that of the ocean when agitated by the wind. Beholding the monkeys
driven on all sides and troubled, Raghava out of anger and compassion
prevented him. And thereupon as if burning (every thing) with his angry
eyes Rama addressed the highly intelligent Bibhishana with the following
angry words--"Why dost thou insult me by destroying all these? Do thou
remove their anxiety--they are all my own men. Neither the houses,
clothes, walls nor reception like these are the veils of women. There is
no sin consequent upon seeing women in danger, difficulty, war,
_Svyambara_[475] sacrifice and marriage. She is now in great danger and
difficulty--there is no sin in seeing her specially in my presence.
Therefore leaving behind the palanquin let her come here on foot and let
the monkeys behold Vaidehi in my presence". Being thus addressed by
Rama, Bibbishana, being sorry, humbly brought Sita near him. There-upon
bearing Rama's accents, Lakshmana, Sugriva and the monkey Hanuman were
greatly sorry. As if hiding herself in her own person in shame Maithili,
following Bibhishana, approached her husband. And she, having a gentle
countetiance and always regarding her husband as her god, fixed her
looks upon her lord's face out of surprise, joy and love. And beholding
the gentle countenance of her dearest lord, resembling the full moon she
removed her mental distress. Thereupon she appeared (beautiful) having
the countenance of the clear moon.

[475] It is a form of marriage in which the bride selects a bridegroom

SECTION CXVII.


Beholding Maithili standing humbly by him, Rama began to give vent to
his pent-up feelings--"O gentle one, destroying all the enemies in the
arena of battle I have subdued thy enemy--I have done all that can be
accomplished by manliness. I have reached the other end of my anger,
rubbed off (the insult) for my spouse being taken away by the enemy and
have killed simultaneously my disgrace and enemy. My manliness hath been
displayed to-day, my labour hath been crowned with success and to-day I
have fulfilled my promise by my own prowess. That accidental misfortune,
under the influence whereof thou wert carried away by the fickle-minded
Rakshasa in my absence, hath been subdued to-day by me, a man. What is
the use of his manliness, who when insulted, cannot remove it? Even if
he be a great man he may be called mean. The praise-worthy works of
Hanuman--the crossing of the deep and the devastation of Lanka, have
been crowned with success to-day. The labour of Sugriva with his army,
who displayed valour in the encounter and gave me good counsels, hath
borne fruit to-day. To-day also the labour of Bibhishana hath borne
fruit--who renouncing his brother, devoid of all good qualities, came to
my side". Hearing those words of Rama, Sita began to look wistfully like
a hind, with eyes full of tears. And beholding his beloved spouse near
him and afraid of popular ignominy his heart was broken into two.
Thereupon he spoke unto the exquisitely beautiful Sita, in the midst of
the monkeys and Rakshasas, having eyes resembling lotus-petals and black
and curling hairs, saying,--"As the southern quarter, incapable of being
got at by the people, was conquered by the self-controlled great ascetic
Agastya, so for thee slaying Ravana, I, (always) anxious to have honour,
have removed my insult--as is the duty of a man. May good betide
thee--do thou know that all my labour, in the battle-field, backed by
the prowess of my friends, is for thee, To uphold the dignity of my
well-known family, to remove the ignominy consequent upon thy being
stolen away as well as to wipe off my own insult I have encompassed
this. I have suspected thy character; thou, (therefore) standing before
me, art distressing me like unto a lamp before one who is subject to an
eye-disease. Do thou therefore proceed, daughter of king Janaka,
wherever thou likest to one of these ten quarters. I permit thee, O
gentle one. I have nothing to do with thee. What powerful man, born in a
high family, take back his wife considering her as friend out of lust,
who hath lived long in another's house? Thou wert taken by Ravana on his
lap, beheld by him with sinful eyes; how can I, taking thee back, bring
disgrace upon my great family? The object, with which I have gained thee
back, hath been accomplished. I have got no attachment for thee--do thou
go wherever thou wishest, gentle one. I speak these unto thee impelled
by my sense of duty. If thou wishest thou mayest live with Lakshmana,
Bharata or Satrughna or with Sugriva or Rakshasa Bibhishana. Do thou
settle, O Sita, where you may find thy own pleasure. O Sita, (I do not
think) Ravana hath overlooked thee, who lived in his house, beholding
thee so graceful and beautiful". Thereupon hearing those unpleasant
words from her beloved (husband) Sita, always sensitive and who had
never heard such unpleasant words, trembling like a creeper torn by the
trunk of an elephant, began to weep shedding tears profusely.



SECTION CXVIII.


Being this addressed by Raghava, enraged, with those harsh words Sita
was greatly pained. And hearing those words of her lord, unheard of,
before the great assembly Maithili was greatly humiliated with shame. As
if entering unto her own person (with shame) and greatly pained with
these arrow-like words the daughter of king Janaka began to shed tears.
Thereupon wiping the tears off her countenance, she with sorrowful
words, addressed her husband--"Why dost thou, O hero, like a common man
addressing an ordinary woman, make me hear these harsh and unbecoming
words painful unto ears? O thou of long arms, I am not what thou hast
taken me to be. Do thou believe me I do swear by my own character.
Seeing the ordinary women thou art distrusting the whole sex. Do thou
renounce this suspicion since thou hast tried me. O lord, though my
person was touched by another--but it was not in my power; nor was it an
wilful act (of mine); accident is to blame in this. My heart is under my
control and that is in thee;--and what could I do of my body which was
subject to another and of which I was not the mistress. O thou the
conferrer of honour--our affection towards one another was increased by
our living continually for a long time; even then if thou hast not been
able to understand me I am ruined for ever. O king, when the great hero
Hanuman was despatched by thee to Lanka to see me why didst thou not
renounce me then? Hadst thou deputed the monkey with that message I
would have renounced my life there and then, O hero. Thou wouldst not
have been required to undergo this toil at the risk of thy own life and
giving unnecessary trouble to thy friends. O foremost of kings, being
subject to ire--thou dost not perceive anything but womanhood in me,
like an ordinary man. Although I am known to have a father but in fact I
am born of the earth. Thou dost not sufficiently honour my character, O
thou conversant with characters. Thy marriage with me in boyhood shall
be disproved and thou art not sufficiently considering all my devotion
and good conduct unto thee". Saying thus with accents choked in tears
and weeping Sita spoke unto Lakshmana, poorly and engaged in meditation.
"Make a funeral pyre for me, O Saumitri, that is the only remedy for
this disaster. Being thus branded with an unfounded stigma I do not like
to keep my life. To adopt the proper course for me who had been
renounced before this assembly by my disaffected husband I shall enter
this". Being thus addressed by Vaidehi, Lakshmana, the slayer of
enemies, being possessed by anger, looked towards Raghava. And
understanding Rama's intention by gestures and at his command the
powerful Saumitri prepared a funeral pyre. None dared there request,
speak with or even look at Rama like unto Death at the time of
dissolution. Thereupon circumambulating Rama, standing with his head
down, Vaidehi approached the burning fire. And bowing unto the
celestials and Brahmanas, Maithili, with folded hands, spoke before the
fire:--"As my heart hath never gone away from Raghava, may thou protect
me, O fire, the witness of the people. As Raghava considereth me vile,
who have got a pure character, may fire, the witness of the people,
protect me on all sides". Saying this and going round the fire, Vaidehi,
with undaunted heart, entered the flaming fire. The great assembly
there, young and old, overwhelmed with grief, saw Maithili enter the
flaming fire. And (Sita) resembling the burning gold entered the flaming
fire in the presence of all people. All beheld Sita, having expansive
eyes, enter fire like unto a golden altar. The ascetics, celestials and
Gandharbas saw that great damsel enter fire like unto a full oblation in
the sacrifice. And beholding her fallen into the fire like unto
_Vasudhara_, sanctified by Mantras in a sacrifice, all the females began
to weep. And the three worlds--the celestials, Gandharbas and Danavas
saw her fallen like unto a celestial from the heaven when imprecited.
She having entered the fire, lamentations, unheard of before, rose from
all sides from the Rakshasas and monkeys.



SECTION CXIX.


Hearing the lamentations (of the Rakshasas and monkeys) the
virtuous-souled Rama, with a poor heart and having his eyes full of
tears, engaged in meditation for some time. Thereupon the king
Vaisravana, Yama with his progenitors, the thousand-eyed lord of the
celestials, Varuna, the lord of water, the three-eyed graceful
Mahadeva--the rider of bull, Brahma the creator of the world and the
foremost of those conversant with the knowledge of Brahma--all these
arriving at the city of Lanka in their cars bright as the rays of the
sun, approached Raghava. Thereupon raising up their huge hands, decked
with various ornaments and folding them, those foremost of the
celestials said unto Raghava--"O lord, thou art the preserver of all the
worlds and the foremost of the wise, why dost thou neglect Sita entering
into fire? Why dost thou not understand thyself the foremost of the
celestials? Thou wert before the Patriarch of all _Vasus_,[476] by the
name of Kratadhama. And thou art thyself, O lord, the creator of the
three worlds. Thou art the eighth of the _Rudras_[477] and the fifth of
the _Sadkyas_;[478] the Acwinis are thy two ears and the sun and the
moon are thy eyes. O slayer of enemies, thou appearest at the begining
and the end of the creation. Why dost thou neglect Vaidehi like an
ordinary man?" Being thus addressed by the deities presiding over
quarters, Raghava, the lord of people and the foremost of the pious,
spoke unto those leading celestials, saying:--"I know myself to be
man--Rama, the son of Dacaratha. Let the great Patriarch tell me, who I
am and whence I have come". Thereupon Brahma, the foremost of those
conversant with the knowledge of Brahma, spoke unto Kakutstha, who had
spoken thus, saying,--"Do thou hear my true words, O thou having truth
for thy prowess. O lord, thou art the great and effulgent, Narayana
holding discus and mace; thou art the boar having one tusk; thou hast
conquered the past, present and future; thou art undecaying and without
end, O Raghava; thou art the great virtue of the pious--thou art the
propounder of all laws and art four-armed; thou art the holder of bow of
time--the subduer of senses--the excellent Purusha (person),
unconquerable by sins; thou art Vishnu holding dagger, Krishna and of
incomparable strength; thou art the army, the minister--the
universe--the understanding, forgiveness and control of passions; thou
art the creation and destruction; Upendra and the slayer of (demon)
Madhu; thou art the creator of Indra; thou art Mahendra; thou hast a
lotus-like navel and thou art the slayer of enemies. The celestials and
the great saints style thee as the refuge of those who seek for shelter.
Thou art the foremost of _Vedas_ with its thousand branches and hundred
regulations. Thou art thyself the creator of the three worlds, O lord.
Thou art the refuge of the _Siddhas_[479] and _Sadhyas_, thou art the
_Purvaja_,[480] the sacrifice, _Vashatkar_,[481] _Om_[482] and
_Paratpara_.[483] No one is conversant with thy birth and
destruction--thou art manifest in all creatures--cows and Brahmins--in
all quarters, in the sky, in the mountain, and in the river. Thou art
gifted with thousand legs, thousand heads and thousand eyes. Thou dost
uphold all creatures, the earth and all the mountains. Thou appearest
like the great serpent in the water underneath the earth. O Rama, thou
dost uphold three creations--the celestials, the Gandharbas and the
Danavas. O Rama--I am thy heart, the worshipful Swaraswati (Goddess of
learning) is thy tongue and all other celestials, lord, created by
Brahma are thy down. The closing of thy eye is the night and the opening
is the day. The _Vedas_ are significant of thy desire and the control
thereof--none hath got independent existence but thee. The whole
universe is thy body, the earth is thy patience, the fire is thy
anger--the sun and the moon are thy delight; thou hast got _Sreebatsha_
(a peculiar curl of hair); thou didst before tread the three worlds with
thy three foot steps; thou didst get the dreadful Bali bound and make
Mahendra king; Sita is Lakshmi and thou art Krishna and Vishnu the
Preserver of people. For Ravana's destruction thou hast assumed the
human shape. Thou hast accomplished that work of ours, O thou the
foremost of the pious. O Rama, Ravana hath been slain. Do thou go up to
heaven delighted. Sure is thy godly energy and never goes for nothing
thy prowess. O Rama, never is fruitless thy view and the chanting of thy
glory. And always successful shall be these persons on earth who shall
be devoted unto thee. Those who shall be devoted unto thee at one with
_Purana_[484] and the excellent _Purasha_,[485] shall attain all their
desires both in this world and the next. Those persons shall never be
unsuccessful both in this world and the next who shall chant this
theme--excellent, instinct with the knowledge of Brahma and describing
the old history.

Hearing those excellent words uttered by the great Patriarch rose up
_Bibhabasu_[486] with Vaidehi on his lap shaking the funeral pyre. With
the daughter of the king Janaka, the receiver[487] of sacrificial
offerings, being incarnate, rose up. And carrying on his lap Vaidehi,
wearing a red cloth, resembling the newly risen sun, adorned with
ornaments of burning gold--having black curling hairs and decked with
fresh garments, _Bibhabasu_ gave her unto Rama. Thereupon the Deity of
Fire, the witness of the people, spoke unto Rama, saying--"O Rama, here
is thy Vaidehi--no sin hath visited her. Neither by words, mind,
understanding nor eyes, she, good-natured and beautiful--hath deviated
from thee who hath got a good character and is heroic. She was in the
solitary forest separated from thee, poorly and having no control over
herself and hence she was carried away by the Rakshasa Ravana having
enough prowess in him. Although shut up in the inner appartment--well
protected and guarded by the dreadful she-demons she had always her mind
in thee and was devoted unto thee. Although tempted in many a way and
remonstrated with she did not think of that Rakshasa in her inner mind.
Her heart is pure and she is not spoiled with sin--do thou therefore
take back Maithili. Do thou not speak other-wise--I do command thee".
Thereupon hearing those words--the virtuous-souled Rama, the foremost of
those skilled in speech, with his eyes agitated with delight, meditated
for sometime. Being thus addressed, the highly effulgent and intelligent
Rama, of unmitigated prowess--the foremost of the pious, spoke unto that
best of celestials saying--"Beautiful (Sita) lived in the inner
appartment of Ravana for a long time so she needs this purification in
the presence of all people. If I would take the daughter of Janaka
without purifying her, people would say that Rama the son of king
Dacaratha is lustful and ignorant of the morality of the people. I know
it full well that Maithili, the daughter of king Janaka, hath her mind
devoted unto me and hath not given it to anyone (else). As the ocean
cannot go beyond its banks so Ravana could not approach her having
expansive eyes protected by virtue of her own chastity. The greatly
vicious-souled one could not even by his mind get Maithili, who was
beyond his reach like unto the burning flame of fire. Her mind could not
have been moved although she lived in the inner appartment of
Ravana--she belongs to none else; Sita is mine as the rays belong to the
Sun. Maithili--the daughter of Janaka hath been purified before the
three worlds--So I am incapable of renouncing her as a self-controlled
person cannot forsake his (own) reputation. It behoveth me to carry out
the well-meaning words of you all--the lords of people who have spoken
them out of affection". Saying this, the victorious, highly powerful,
well renowned Raghava, worthy of enjoying happiness, and having his
praise chanted in consequence of his noble action, regaining his spouse,
attained to happiness.

Hearing those excellent words uttered by Raghava, Maheswara (Siva) spoke
far more important words--"O thou having lotus-eyes, O thou having huge
arms and a spacious breast, O thou the slayer of enemies, O thou the
fore most of the pious--it is a good fortune that this hath been done by
thee. It is by good fortune, O Rama, the dreadful and increasing
darkness--the fear of all people--Ravana, hath been removed by thee in
the encounter. Consoling the poor Bharata and the famed Kaucalya,
beholding Kaikeyi and Sumitra the mother of Lakshmana, obtaining the
kingdom of Ayodhya, pleasing all thy friends, establishing the prestige
of thy family, thou of great strength, performing horse-sacrifices,
attaining fair fame and conferring riches upon the Brahmins do thou
repair to heaven. This king Dacaratha stationed on the car is thy
father. He was thy superior on this earth, O Kakutstha. Obtaining thee
as his son, that graceful (king) hath repaired to the region of Indra.
Do thou bow unto him with thy brother Lakshmana". Hearing the words of
Mahadeva, Raghava, along with Lakshmana, bowed unto their father who was
seated on the top of the car. He with Lakshmana beheld their father
shining in his own effulgence and wearing an unsullied cloth. Thereupon
beholding his son dearer than his life, attaining great delight (in
consequence thereof) placing him on his lap and embracing him with his
arms, the great king Dacaratha, having long arms and seated on an
excellent seat in the car, said--"I am now in heaven and am equal with
the celestials, but without thee, O Rama, I do not like it--this is
true--I do swear by thee. O thou the foremost of those skilled in
speech, I have still in my mind the words which were uttered by Kaikeyi
for sending thee away to the woods. Beholding thee all well and
embracing thee with Lakshmana I am now shorn of grief like unto the sun,
devoid of dues. I have been emancipated, O my son, through thee--a good
and high-souled son, as the virtuous-souled Brahmana Kapala was by
Asthabakra. O gentle one, I have heard from the celestials, (that thou
art) the excellent Purusha in the guise (of a man) for the destruction
of Ravana. Blessed is Kaucalya, O Rama, who shall be greatly delighted,
on beholding thee, the slayer of enemies, gone home from the forest.
Blessed are those men, O Rama, who shall behold thee installed in the
city as the king of the world. I wish to behold thee reconciled with
Bharata, devoted powerful, pure and performing pious observances. O
gentle one, thou hast spent fourteen years in the forest with Sita and
Lakshmana. The term of thy exile is over--thy promise hath been
fulfilled; and slaying Ravana, in the conflict thou hast pleased the
celestials. Thou hast performed a mighty deed and attained to excellent
fame, O slayer of enemies; and placed in charge of thy kingdom do thou
with thy brothers attain a long life". The king speaking thus Rama spoke
unto him with folded hands saying,--"O thou conversant with piety, do
thou be propitiated with Bharata and Kaikeyi. Thou didst imprecate
Kaikeyi, saying,--"I renounce thee with thy son"--may not that dreadful
curse visit her and her son". Saying "so be it" unto Rama with folded
hands and embracing Lakshmana the great king said to him:--"O thou
conversant with piety and fame on this earth, thou shall attain to
heaven and excellent state there. O thou the enhancer of Sumitra's
joy--do thou attend upon Rama; may good betide thee; Rama is ever
engaged in the welfare of all beings. All these celestials headed by
Indra, Siddhas and Great saints, bowing unto this high-souled and
excellent Purusha, worship him. Rama, the subduer of foes, is the
indescribable and undecaying letter _Brahma_, which has, been described
(in the Vedas) as the heart and secret of the celestials. For serving
him along with Sita, the daughter of king of Videha, thou hast attained
piety and excellent fame". Addressing Lakshmana thus, the king spoke
unto his daughter-in-law, who was standing before him with folded hands,
saying:--"It doth not behove thee, O Vaidehi, to be enraged (with Rama)
for renouncing thee; for purifying thee this was done by him ever
wishing thy welfare. What thou hast performed, O daughter, to establish
the purity of thy character, is hard to perform. What thou hast done,
shall glorify all other females. Though there is no necessity for giving
thee any instruction as regards thy duty towards thy husband-still I
should say that he is thy great god". Having thus instructed his two
sons and Sita, he repaired, in his car, to the region of Indra. Having
advised his two sons along with Sita, ascending the car, and shining in
his effulgence, that excellent king, greatly delighted, repaired to the
region of the king of celestials.



SECTION CXXII.


Dacaratha having repaired, Mahendra greatly delighted spoke unto
Raghava, stationed there with folded hands, saying:--"O Rama, O foremost
of men, this our presence here, must not be fruitless, we are
pleased--do thou ask for what thou wishest". Being thus accosted by the
high-souled Mahendra--delighted, Raghava spoke, with a pleased heart--"O
lord of the celestials, O thou the foremost of those skilled in speech,
if thou art propitiated with me, I shall pray for (my
wished-for-object); do thou grant it. Let all these highly powerful
monkeys, who have been despatched to the abode of Death, on my account,
regaining their life, stand up. O thou the conferror of honour, I wish
to see all those delighted monkeys, who were separated from their wives
and children on my account. O Purandara, do thou revive all these heroic
and powerful (monkeys) who did not care for death, and who worked hard
and were distressed (for me). May all those, by thy favour, who were
ever devoted unto me and did not care for death (even) regain their
life--this is the boon I pray for. O conferror of honour, I wish to see
all these monkeys, _Golangulas_ and bears, pale and hurt, unheart and
gifted with strength and prowess like before. Let there be flowers,
fruits and roots, even out of season wherever these monkeys shall
live--and let rivers there be full of clear water". Hearing those words
of the high-souled Raghava Mahendra replied with words instinct with
delight--"O my boy, O foremost of the Raghus, mighty is the boon thou
hast prayed for--my words shall never be falsified, so let them be be
fulfilled. Let all those bears and Golangulas rise up who were slain in
the conflict by Rakshasas and had their heads and arms severed. Let the
monkeys gifted with their pristine strength and prowess rise up unhurt
and healthy as if after the end of sleep. And being reconciled with
their friends, relatives and kinsmen let them attain to excellent joy. O
thou the wielder of a huge bow, all the trees shall be filled with
flowers and fruits and all the rivers shall be filled with water even
out of season (wherever they shall live)". Thereupon all these leading
monkeys who had their persons wounded but now healed up, rose up like
those asleep. And all those monkeys were greatly wondered, saying, "What
is it?" And beholding Kakutstha of accomplished, end and eulogizing Rama
and Lakshmana, all the celestials, greatly delighted, said,--"Do thou, O
king, repair to Ayodhya--despatch all the monkeys--console the famed
Maithilee, ever devoted unto thee--behold thy brother Bharata observing
ascetic vows in consequence of thy grief--and the high-souled Satrughna
and all thy mothers, O slayer of foes. And being Installed on the throne
do thou conduce to the joy of all citizens". Having thus addressed Rama
along with Lakshmana, the thousand-eyed Deity, delighted, went away
along with the celestials, in their cars resembling the Sun (in
brilliance). And saluting all the celestials, Kakutstha, with his
brother Lakshmana, ordered the encampment of the army. Thereupon that
famous and well-pleased huge army of the monkeys protected by Rama and
Lakshmana, appeared resplendant on all sides like unto a night
beautified with the rays of the Moon.



SECTION CXXIII.


Rama having spent that night happily and risen up the next morning,
Bibhishana, chanting his victory, spoke unto that slayer of foes, with
folded hands, saying:--"Here are various articles for bathing, pastes,
clothes, ornaments, sandal and various excellent garlands. And here are
present women having eyes like lotuses and conversant with the art of
decking. Let them perform their duty, O Raghava". Being thus accosted
Kakutstha replied unto Bibhishana, saying:--"Do thou invite all these
monkeys beaded by Sugriva to bathe. The virtuous-souled Bharata, having
huge arms and ever used to comforts, is greatly distressed on my
account. Without Bharata the son of Kaikeyi, ever performing pious
rites, I do not value bathing or these clothes and ornaments. Do thou so
manage that we may go to the city of Ayodhya speedily. For difficult is
the way leading to Ayodhya". Being thus accosted Bibhiskana relied unto
Kakutstha,--"O son of the lord of earth, may good betide thee, I shall
soon take thee to that city. The car _Puskpaka_ resembling the Sun,
belonging to my brother Kuvera, was brought by the powerful Ravana. O
thou of unequalled prowess, that celestial and excellent car, going
everywhere at will, since the destruction of Ravana in battle, is ready
for thee. And that car resembling the cloud is in the city of Lanka, in
which thou shalt, relieved of thy anxiety, repair to Ayodhya. If I am
worthy of being favoured by thee, if dost thou remember any
accomplishment of mine--if thou hast any friendship for me, do thou, O
wise one, wait here with thy brother Lakshmana and spouse Vaidehi till I
accomplish all my desires by worshipping thee. And then thou shalt go
(to Ayodhya) O Rama. I shall worship thee with great delight and do
thou, O Rama, with thy friends and army, accept that adoration. O Rama,
out of love, honor, and brotherly feeling, I do crave thy permission. I
am a servant I cannot command thee". Being thus addressed, Rama replied
unto Bibhishaua in the presence of all the Rakshasas and monkeys,
saying:--"I have been worshipped by thee, O hero, with thy excellent
counsels, with thy earnest endeavours and with thy great friendship. Do
not think, O lord of Rakshasas, that I do not comply with thy
request--my heart hastens me to behold my brother Bharata, who, to take
me back, did come to the mount Chitrakuta, who laid low his crown at my
feet and whose words I did not keep. (I am anxious to see) Kaucalya,
Sumitra, Kaikeyi, with my friends, citizens and villagers. Do thou
regard me, O Bibhishana, O gentle one, as worshipped. O friend do thou
be not angry--I request thee. Do thou speedily being the car for me, O
lord of Rakshasas--my work is done--how can I wish to live here long".
Being thus addressed by Rama, Bibhishana the lord of Rakshasas, speedily
brought the car resembling the Sun.

Thereupon arrived there the car adorned all over with gold paintings,
altars crested with _Baidurja_ jewels, having upper rooms, silvered all
over, adorned with white flags and flagstaffs, beautified with gilt
lotuses, adorned with golden houses, covered with a network of girdles,
having windows made of pearls and jems, girt on all sides with a net of
bells, giving forth melodious sound, resembling the summit of the mount
Meru, constructed by _Vicwakarma_ (the architect of the celestials)
adorned with huge apartments beautified with silver and pearls--having
its base crested with crystal, containing excellent seats made of
_Baidurja_, abounding in valuable coverlets and immense wealth,
incapable of being broken down and coursing at will. And communicating
unto Rama (the arrival of that car) Bibhishana waited there. Beholding
that flowery car, coursing at will and resembling a huge mountain, Rama,
of a generous spirit, along with Saumitri, attained to an excess of
astonishment.



SECTION CXXIV.


Having brought that car Pushpaka, adorned with flowers and having
stationed himself at a distance, Bibhishana the lord of Rakshasas, being
incited to hurry on, humbly and with folded hands, spoke unto Rama,
saying, "What shall I do, O Raghava?" Hearing those words the highly
powerful Raghava, in the presence of Lakshmana, gave vent to the
following accents out of affection--"All these monkeys and bears have
brought about the accomplishment of my work with great care. Do thou,
satisfy them, O Bibhishana, with diverse jewels and riches. With these
and thee, I conquered the city of Lanka, lord of Rakshasas. They all
fought with a delighted heart, having renounced all fear of life and who
did never go away from the battle-field. Do thou, with a gift of riches
and jewel, make good the work of these monkeys and bears who encompassed
the accomplishment (of my end). Being honoured and delighted by thee
grateful, all these leading monkeys shall repair (to their respective
quarters). (If thou art found to be) sacrificing, self-controlled,
compassionate and (the just) collector of revenues, all shall be
attached unto thee. For this I do address you (thus). O lord of men, the
soldiers, disgusted, renounce that king who is void of all royal
accomplishments, and who uselessly slays soldiers in the conflict".
Being thus accosted by Rama, Bibhishana, with a distribution of jewels
and riches, honoured all those monkeys. And beholding all those leading
monkeys worshipped with jewels and riches Rama ascended that excellent
car, taking the bashful, and high-minded Vaidehi on his lap and
accompanied, by his powerful brother Lakshmana, a skilled bowman. And
being stationed on the car Kakutstha honouring all the monkeys, the
highly powerful Sugriva and Bibhishana, said--"O foremost of monkeys, ye
have performed a friendly service--it hath been appreciated by me--do ye
repair to your wished-for quarters. O Sugriva, thou, ever afraid of
impiety, hast performed all that a loving and well-wishing friend should
do. Do thou, encircled by thy army, proceed towards Kishkindha. Do thou,
O Bibhishana, live in thy kingdom, Lanka, conferred upon thee, by me.
Not even the celestials, headed by Indra shall be able to assail thee. I
wish to return to Ayodhya, the capital of my father's (kingdom). I wish
to obtain your permission (and for this) I have invited you all". Being
thus addressed by Rama, all the leading monkeys bears as well as the
Rakshasa Bibhishana said with folded hands--"We wish all to go to
Ayodhya. Do thou take us. We shall all range with delight at forests and
gardens. Beholding thee installed and bowing unto Kaucalya, we shall
soon return to our respective homes, O foremost of kings". Being thus
accosted by the monkeys with Bibhishana, the virtuous-souled Rama, spoke
unto them and Sugriva and Bibhishana, saying--"Dearer than the dear, I
shall attain to, when returning my city, along with you all, I shall
enjoy in the company of all my friends and relatives. O Sugriva, do thou
soon ascend the car along with the monkeys. Do thou ascend too, O
Bibhishana, lord of Rakshasas, with all thy courtiers". Thereupon
ascended that celestial car _Pushpaka_, Sugriva, greatly delighted with
the monkeys and Bibhishana, with his courtiers. And they all having got
up, the excellent car, of Kuvera at the command of Raghava, rose up in
the welkin. And in that car coursing at will and drawn by effulgent
ganders, Rama greatly delighted appeared like Kuvera (himself). And all
the monkeys, bears and the highly powerful Rakshasas sat in that
celestial car unobstructed and at their pleasure.



SECTION CXXV.


Being commanded by Rama, that excellent car, drawn by ganders, with a
huge noise, rose high up in the welkin. And casting his looks on all
sides, Rama, the descendant of Raghus, spake unto Sita, the daughter of
the king of Mithila, having a moon-like countenance, saying,--"O
Vaidehi, do thou behold Lanka, situate on the summit of the mount
Chitrakuta, resembling that of Kailaca and constructed by _Vicwakarma_.
And behold, O Sita, that huge arena of battle, bathed in the blood and
flesh of the monkeys and Rakshasas. Do thou behold, O thou having
expansive eyes, Ravana, the lord of Rakshasas, the repressor of people
and who obtained a boon, lying there, slain by me on thy account.
Kumbhakarna was slain there, the night-ranger Prahasta, as well, and
Dumraksha, were slain by the monkey Hanuman. Bidyutmali was slain there
by the high-souled Sushena--and Indrajit, the son of Ravana, was slain
there in the encounter, by Lakshmana. The Rakshasa named Bikata was
slain there by Angadi--and Birupaksha, hard to look at and Mahaparsha
and Mahodara. And the powerful Akampana was slain (there) and all other
Rakshasas--Trishira, Alikaya, Devantaka and Narantaka--and the two
leading and powerful Rakshasas, mad after conflict--the sons of
Kumbhakarna--Nikumbha and Kumbha, Bajradanstra, Danstra and many other
Rakshasas were slain and the irrepressible Makaraksha was slain (there)
by me in the conflict. Akampana was slain--and the powerful Sonitaksha.
And Yupaksha and Prajangha were destroyed (there) in the great conflict.
The grim-visaged Rakshasa Viddutsjmha was slain there--and Yajnasatru
and the highly powerful Suptaghna. (And there was slain) Suryasatru and
Brahmasatru. (And there bewailed for Ravana) his spouse Mandodari,
surrounded by his thousand other wives. O thou having an excellent
countenance, do thou behold the descending place of the ocean, where I
spent the night after crossing the deep for thee. O thou having
expansive eyes, for thee, this difficult construction of the bridge was
made by me over the deep by the help of Nala. Do thou, O Vaidehi, behold
the unagitated deep--the abode of Varuna, appearing as if without the
other end, roaring and abounding in conchs and pearl oysters. O
Maithili, do thou behold the golden mount, which rose above the deep for
affording a resting place unto Hanuman. And on the bank of this ocean I
halted with my soldiers. And here Mahadeva, the lord of the celestials,
was propitiated with me. It behoveth thee to behold this descending
place of the high-souled Ocean, known as _Setubandha_,[488] worshipped
of the three worlds, highly sacred and destroying even the worst sin.
There, Bibhishana, the king of Rakshasas first came to me. Do thou
behold, O Sita, Kishkindha, having beautiful gardens, the pleasant city
of Sugriva, where Vali was slain by me". And beholding the city of
Kishkindha, ruled over by Vali, Sita, incited by her love, addressed
Rama, with worthy words, saying--"O king, I wish to repair to Ayodhya
thy capital with thee, in the company of Tara, the dear wife of Sugriva,
as well as of the wives of other leading monkeys". Being thus addressed
by Vaidehi Raghava replied--saying, "this shall be done" and getting at
Kishkindha he stopped the car. And having beheld the car stationed he
spoke unto Sugriva, saying--"O foremost of monkeys, do thou speak unto
all the leading monkeys that they may go to Ayodhya accompanied by their
wives. O thou of great strength--they may all go with Sita. Do thou
hurry them on, O Sugriva. We shall (soon) go, O thou the lord of
monkeys". Being thus addressed by Rama, of unmitigated prowess--the
beautiful lord of monkeys, encircled by them, entered speedily the inner
apartment and beholding Tara there, said--"O dear, at the command of
Raghava and the kind desire of Sita, do thou soon go, taking with thee
the wives of all the high-souled monkeys. We shall see Ayodhya and the
wives of Dacaratha". Hearing the words of Sugriva, Tara, having a
perfectly beautiful person, assembling all the wives of the monkeys,
said--"You have been ordered by Sugriva to repair (to Ayodhya) with the
monkeys;--to behold Ayodhya, is also a dear object of mine. (I shall
behold) Rama enter the city with the citizens and villagers and the
wealth and riches of the wives of Dacaratha". Being thus commanded by
Tara, the wives of the monkeys, putting on all their ornaments and
circumambulating (her) ascended the car, with a view to behold Sita. And
beholding the car going up with them all, Raghava again spoke unto Sita,
near the mount Rishyamuka, saying,--"Do thou behold there, O Sita, the
huge and foremost mount Rishyamuka abounding in gold and various metals,
like unto clouds accompanied with lightnings. There I was joined by
Sugriva, the lord of monkeys. And there I entered into an agreement, O
Sita, for the destruction of Vali. And there is (the lake) Pampa
abounding in lilies and skirted by picturesque forest where separated
from thee, I bewailed piteously. And on its bank I beheld the pious
_Savari_. And there I slew _Kavandha_ and _Yoyanavahu_. Behold there, O
Sita, a beautiful tree, in Janasthana, where, O thou ever used to
luxuries, for thee, the highly powerful and energetic Yatayu, the
foremost of birds, was slain by Ravana. Do thou behold there, O thou of
a beautiful person, O thou of auspicious looks, our hermitage and the
beautiful cottage of leaves, wherefrom thou hadst been carried away by
force by the lord of Rakshasas. Do thou behold there the beautiful and
sacred river Godaveri having clear water and the hermitage of Agastya,
surrounded by plantain trees. Do thou behold there, O Vaidehi, the great
hermitage of _Sarabhanga_, where came the thousand-eyed, Sakra, the
subduer of enemies' cities. O worshipful dame, O thou having a middle
stature--amongst all those ascetics, thou beholdest, there lived Atri,
the lord of our family--resembling the fire of the Sun. There was slain
the huge-bodied Biradha by me. There thou didst behold, O Sita, the
female ascetic (the wife of Attri) ever performing pious observances.
There cometh in view, O thou having a beautiful person, the king of
mountains, Chitrakuta, where to propitiate me, came the son of Sumitra.
Behold the beautiful Yamuna, having picturesque forest on its bank and
the pleasant hermitage of Varadwaya. Behold there the sacred river
Ganges, dividing itself into three branches. Behold there the city of
Sringabera, where I made friendship with Guha. Behold there, O Sita, the
capital of my father. Do thou bow unto Ayodhya, O Vaidehi". Thereupon
all the monkeys and Rakshasas along with Bibhishana rose up delightedly
and saw the city. Thereupon the monkeys and Rakshasas beheld the city
abounding in white houses having spacious compartments, filled with
elephants and horses and looking like Amaravati, the capital of
Mahendra.

[488] This is still to be seen in the shape of a delapidated bridge near
      _Rameswar_ a place of pilgrimage. Pilgrims go there Via Madura, a
      district in South Madras. The Raja of Ramnud in whose Zemindari it
      is situated is called Setupati.--T.



SECTION CXXVI.


Having completed the fourteen years (of exile), the self-controlled
elder brother of Lakshmana, arriving at the hermitage of Varadwaya on
the fifth day, saluted the ascetic. And bowing unto Varadwaya, having
asceticism for his wealth, he said,--"O thou gifted with six sorts of
wealth, hast thou heard of the prosperity and well being (of my city)?
Is Bharata still engaged (in guarding the people)? Are my mothers
living?" Being thus addressed by Rama the great ascetic Varadwaya
replied, delighted, and smiling, unto that foremost of Raghus,--"Abiding
by thy command and with matted locks, Bharata is waiting for thee,
always honoring thy sandals. And all others are well in thy house. O
subduer of thy enemies, I was greatly pained, when I saw thee before
entering the huge forest, wearing bark, three with thy wife,[489]
deprived of thy kingdom for piety only, walking on foot, renouncing
every thing, obeying the command of thy sire, deprived of all comforts,
like a celestial banished from heaven, deprived of thy kingdom at the
words of Kaikeyi, and living on wild roots and fruits; but beholding
thee now of accomplished end, with all thy friends having vanquished the
enemy, I have attained to highest delight. O Raghava, I am apprised of
immense griefs and happinesses which befell thee when thou didst live in
Janasthana. Thy blameless spouse was carried away stealthily by Ravana
engaged as thou wert in the behoof of the Brahmanas, and in the
protection of all the ascetics. The view of Maricha--the carrying away
of Sita,--the beholding of the headless demon,--thy going to (the lake)
Pampa,--thy friendship with Sugriva, where Vali was slain by thee,--the
enquiry of Vaidehi undertaken by the son of Wind-god,--the construction
of the bridge by Nala after the whereabouts of Vaidehi had been
known--the conflagration of Lanka by the delighted and the leading
monkeys--the destruction, in the conflict, of Ravana proud of his own
strength, along with his sons, friends, courtiers, army and steeds--the
arrival of the celestials on the destruction of Ravana, the thorn of
gods and the grant of boon by them--I have known all these by virtue of
my asceticism, O thou fond of virtue. My disciples used to go hence to
that city to bring tidings. I shall even now grant thee a boon, O
foremost of those using weapons. Do thou accept my _Arghya_[490] and
then repair to Ayodhya to-morrow". And respectfully abiding by his
words, that effulgent son of the king, delighted, begged of him the
boon. "O thou gifted with six qualities, on my way while proceeding to
Ayodhya, let all the trees, bearing fruits out of season, and producing
honey, bear many a nectar-smelling fruit". No sooner he replied
saying,--"Thy promise shall be fulfilled" than all the trees there
became like those of heaven. Trees without fruits were filled
therewithal and trees without flowers were covered with them. All the
trees, whose leaves were dried up, were enveloped with foliage and all
of them began to pour honey. The way to Ayodhya for three _yojanas_ was
thus filled all over (with trees). Thereupon thousands of monkeys,
living, at pleasure and delightedly, on various celestial fruits,
thought as if they were in heaven.

[489] _i.e._ thyself, Lakshmana and Sita.

[490] A respectful oblation to gods or venerable men of rice, _durva_
      grass, flowers &c with water in a small boat-shaped vessel.



SECTION CXXVII.


Thereupon beholding Ayodhya, Rama, the descendant of Raghu, of light
movements and desirous of affording delight unto others, thought of
welcoming (them). Thinking thus the intelligent and effulgent (Rama)
cast his looks towards the monkeys and spoke unto Hanuman, saying,--"O
foremost of monkeys, speedily reparing to Ayodhya do thou learn of the
welfare of all people in the palace of the king. Arriving at the city of
Sringavera, do thou communicate unto Guha, the king of _Nishadhas_[491]
having the forest as his kingdon, my well-being, at my command. Hearing
that I am hale and hearty and relieved of all troubles, Guha, my friend
like my own self, shall attain to delight. And Guha, the lord of
_Nishadhas_, delighted, shall inform thee of the way to Ayodhya and the
well being of Bharata. Do thou ask of Bharata his well-being at my
words, and communicate unto him my (arrival) with Lakshmana and my
spouse after having made good the vow (of my sire)--the carrying away of
Sita by the powerful Ravana--the friendship with Sugriva and the
destruction of Vali in the conflict--the search of Maithili instituted
by thee having got over the huge lord of rivers--the advance (of the
monkeys) to the banks of the deep--the view of the ocean, the
construction of the bridge--the destruction of Ravana,--the grant of
boon by Mahendra, Brahma and Varuna--my meeting with my father by the
favour of Mahadeva. Do thou, O gentle one, communicate unto Bharata, my
arrival here with the lord of Rakshasas and king of monkeys. (Tell him)
'vanquishing his foes and attaining to excellent fame Rama hath arrived
at the gate of the city with his valiant friends, having satisfied the
vow (of his sire).' Thou shouldst read the signs expressive of joy or
sorrow that Bharata shall display on hearing this and infer therefrom
his attitude towards me. Thou shouldst know, from the colour of his
countenance, his looks and his words, all the movements and actions of
Bharata. Whose mind doth not change obtaining such an ancestral kingdom,
filled with all prosperity and abounding in elephants, horses and
chariots? If the effulgent Bharata, the descendant of Raghu, ruling over
it, wisheth the kingdom for himself, let him lord over the entire earth.
Therefore, O monkey, it behoveth thee to come back speedily apprised of
his intention and movements, before we proceed further". Being thus
commanded, Hanuman, the son of Wind-god, assuming a human shape speedily
proceeded towards Ayodhya. Hanuman the son of Maruta rose up in the
welkin with velocity like unto Garuda ready to fall upon a huge serpent.
Then crossing the Wind-path and the abode of the birds, getting over the
terrible confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna, reaching the city of
_Sringavera_ and meeting Guha, the energetic Hanuman, delighted,
(addressed him) with the following excellent words--"Thy friend Rama,
the descendant of Kakutstha, having truth for his prowess, with Sita and
son of Sumitra, hath enquired of thy welfare. Having spent five
nights[492] till to-day, he, having obtained permission from the ascetic
_Varadwaja_, shall proceed to-morrow". Having said this the highly
energetic monkey, not caring for the exhaustion of travel, greatly
delighted and with hairs erect, rose up with great velocity. Beholding
the holy river sanctified with the name of Parasurama, the
rivers--Balukini, Baruthi, Gomati, the huge forest of _Sala_ trees, the
various countries populated with thousands of people, and proceeding a
great distance speedily, that foremost of monkeys got at the trees near
_Nandigram_[493] like unto those of Chaitraratha, the garden of the lord
of celestials the flowers whereof were being plucked off by many a
damsel accompanied by their children decked in various ornaments. He saw
at a distance of one _crosa_ from Ayodhya, Bharata wearing the skin of
an antelope, poorly, greatly reduced, living in a hermitage, wearing
matted hairs, having his body covered with dirt, greatly pulled down in
consequence of his brother's disaster, living on roots and fruits,
self-controlled; living the life of an ascetic, observing pious
observances, with a bundle of clotted hairs on his head, wearing bark
and deer skin, having control over his passions and senses, effulgent
like _Brahmarshis_, ruling the earth always placing the sandals before
him, protecting people of four _Varnas_ against all fear, with
courtiers, priests leading a holy life and soldiers all wearing red
clothes; around him. All those citizens, fond of piety, did not like to
use good clothes beholding the prince use bark and deer skin. Thereupon
Hanuman, the son of Maruta spake with folded hands unto him, conversant
with piety like virtue incarnate, saying--"Kakutstha, living in the
forest of Dandaka with bark and matted hairs, for whom thou art
lamenting, hath enquired after thy welfare. Do thou, O worshipful sire,
speak out thy welfare and renounce the dreadful grief. Thou shalt in
this moment be reconciled to thy brother Rama. Slaying Ravana, and
regaining Maithili, Rama, having accomplished his end, hath arrived here
with his valiant friends. The highly effulgent Lakshmana and the famed
Vaidehi (have also come). Sita fareth well with Rama like unto Sachi in
the company of Mahendra". Being thus addressed by Hanuman, Bharata, the
son of Kaikeyi, delighted, fell down all on a sudden in a swoon of joy.
Thereupon rising up in no time, and welcoming him, Bharata, the
descendant of Raghu, spake unto Hanuman communicating the pleasant
tidings, the following words. And embracing the monkey respectfully the
graceful Bharata sprinkled him with profuse tears not out of grief but
of joy. He said,--"Art thou a man or god who hast kindly come here? O
gentle one, I shall confer upon thee, who hast communicated unto me this
pleasant tidings, hundreds and thousands of kine, hundreds of prosperous
villages, sixteen young wives, pious, wearing excellent _Kundalas_,
golden-hued, having beautiful noses and breasts, having moon-like
countenances, decked with all ornaments and born of respectable
families". And hearing from that leading monkey of that wonderful return
of Rama, the son of the king, delighted became anxious to behold him and
again addressed joyously Hanuman with the following words.

[491] A low caste aboriginal Hindu corresponding to our _Chandalas_
      always living in the forest. The Raja of Ramnud in the district of
      Madura in Madras traces his descent from this Guha.

[492] Having spent five nights after the expiry of fourteen years of
      exile he is living at the hermitage of Varadwaja. He shall leave
      that place to-morrow.--T.

[493] The country of Bharata's maternal uncle.--T.



SECTION CXXVIII.


"I hear the tidings of my brother affording me great delight who hath
been living in the huge forest for many a year. The saying of the people
appeareth to me as instinct with well meaning that a man, if alive, may
attain to joy even after a century. Do thou relate truly unto me, how
and in what country the union between Raghava and the monkeys was
brought about". Being thus accosted by the prince and seated on Kuca,
he, thereupon, began to describe Rama's life in the forest. "How Rama
was exiled, the two boons conferred upon thy mother, how king Dacaratha
died in consequence of (his) son's grief, how by emissaries, O lord,
thou wert brought up from the house of thy maternal uncle, how thou
didst not wish for the kingdom having entered Ayodhya, how thy brother,
the repressor of enemies, was solicited by thee for accepting the
kingdom, reparing to the mount Chitrakuta, who hast ever wended the
track of the pious, the renouncement of kingdom (by him) abiding by the
words of the king, thy return after taking the sandals of thy revered
(brother)--all these, O thou of long-arms, are known to thee. I shall
relate unto thee all that happened after thy return. Thyself having
returned thence, all the birds and animals were overwhelmed with terror
and that forest appeared as if distressed. Thereupon he entered the
solitary and huge and dreadful forest Dandaka distressed by the
elephants and abounding in lions, tigers and deer. And they entering the
dense forest there appeared before them the powerful Biradha[494]
emitting a dreadful sound. And taking him up roaring aloud like an
elephant Rama threw him with his arms upwards and face downwards into a
pit. Having accomplished that difficult work the two brothers Rama and
Lakshmana, arrived in the evening at the pleasant hermitage of
_Sarabhanga_. And _Sarabhanga_ having attained to heaven, Rama, having
truth for his prowess, saluting all the ascetics, repaired to
Janasthana. And by the high-souled Raghava, living there, fourteen
thousand inhabitants of Janasthana were slain. In the company of one
person only and at the commencement of the fight, by Rama, within the
one fourth part of a day, were exterminated all the highly powerful and
valiant inhabitants of the forest of Dandaka always putting obstructions
in the way of the ascetics. All the Rakshasas were grinded (to death) by
Raghava. Khara was slain in the conflict; Dushana being slain first
Trishira was slain thereafter by him. Thereafter (a she-demon) named
Surpanakha, came to the side of Rama. Thereupon being commanded by Rama,
the highly powerful Lakshmana rose up all on a sudden and taking a
dagger chopped off her ears and nose. Being thus insulted by him that
she-demon came to Ravana. Thereupon a dreadful Rakshasa named
Maricha--an attendant of Ravana, assuming the shape of a jewelled deer,
allured Vaidehi. And beholding it, Vaidehi spake unto Rama, saying,--'Do
thou catch it; with it when caught our hermitage shall be more
charming.' Thereupon Rama, with bow in his hand, pursued that deer and
with one shaft destroyed it. O gentle one, Raghava going out on hunting,
and Lakshmana having issued out of the hermitage, the Ten-necked (demon)
entered therein. And he speedily got hold of Sita, like unto Rohini
possessed by the planet in the sky. Thereupon slaying the vulture Yatayu
in the conflict desirous of rescuing her and getting hold of Sita that
Rakshasa speedily repaired (to his capital). Thereupon some monkeys
resembling mountains, stationed on the summit of a mountain, stricken
with wondrous fear and astonishment, beheld Ravana, the lord of
Rakshasas proceed with Sita. Ascending the car _Puskpaka_, going at
will, with Vaidehi and hastening his course that highly powerful Ravana,
the lord of Rakshasas entered Lanka. And entering the huge and excellent
golden palace Ravana consoled Maithili with (diverse) words. But she
regarded that foremost of Rakshasas and his words as straw. And Vaidehi
was placed in the forest of Asoka. Thereupon returned Rama after having
slain the deer in the forest. Having returned and seen the vulture,
dearer than his father, slain, Rama, the descendant of Kakutstha was
pained. And searching Vaidehi and ranging at the banks of Godaveri and
forest-lands covered with flowers, Rama with Lakshmana, met in that huge
forest a Rakshasa named Kavandha. Thereupon at the words of Kavandha,
Rama, having truth for his prowess, repairing to the mount Rishyamuka,
was united with Sugriva. There had grown mutual love in them before they
were known to each other. Sugriva was driven away by his angry brother
Vali. And informed of each other's affairs their friendship grew closer.
There-upon slaying the huge-bodied and highly powerful Vali in the
conflict by virtue of the strength of his own arms Rama obtained (for
Sugriva) his own kingdom. And being placed on the throne with all the
monkeys, Sugriva promised unto Rama the enquiry of the Princess (Sita).
Being commanded by the high-souled Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, ten
_kotis_ of monkeys repaired to (various) quarters. Among them some of us
lost our way in a cavity of the Vindhya mountain, and were striken with
great terror--and accordingly much time was lost. The powerful brother
of the king of vultures named Sampati communicated unto us the residence
of Sita in the palace of Ravana. Thereupon removing the grief of my
relatives stricken with sorrow and resorting to my own prowess, I jumped
over a hundred _yojanas_ and beheld her placed in the forest of Asoka,
wearing a red cloth, pale, deprived of all joy and observing strict
penances. And then nearing her and beholding her of a perfectly
blameless person I bestowed upon her an ensign a ring with Rama's name
engraven on it. And obtaining a jewel as an ensign, I, with my object
accomplished, returned. And having returned I presented Rama of
unwearied actions with that ensign of a brilliant gem. And hearing (of
the news of Vaidehi) Rama regained his life like one on the verge of
death regaining his being after drinking nectar. And exciting (his
soldiers) for making preparations like unto Fire about to destroy all
people he made up his mind for the devastation of Lanka. Thereupon
arriving at the banks of the ocean he had a bridge constructed by Nala
by which the army of monkey-heroes crossed (the deep). Nala destroyed
Prahasta, Raghava slew Kumbhakarna, Lakshmana killed the son of Ravana
and Rama himself slew Ravana. He was then met by Sakra, Yama, Varuna,
Siva, Brahma and Dacaratha. And that graceful descendant of Kakutstha,
the slayer of foes, obtained the boon from them as well as from the
saints assembled there--(celestial and otherwise). Having obtained the
boon he, delighted, met the monkeys and in the car _Pushpaka_ reached
Kishkindha. Again reaching the Ganges he is living with the ascetic; it
becometh thee to behold him to-morrow under the auspices of of
Pushya,[495] without any hindrance". Thereupon being delighted with the
sweet accents of Hanuman, Bharata addressed him, with folded hands, with
words affording delight, saying,--"After a long time my desire hath been
fulfilled".

[494] A demon of that name.

[495] The lunar asterism comprising three stars of which one is the
      Cancer.



SECTION CXXIX.


Hearing those words affording great delight, Bharata, the slayer of
enemies, having truth for his prowess, delighted, ordered Satrughna,
(saying),--"Let all people being purified worship all the deities and
altars of the city with fragrant garlands and diverse music. Let all the
bards conversant with the chanting of the pedigree, the flatterers, all
those conversant with music, the dancing girls, the queens, the
courtiers, the soldiers with their wives, Brahmanas, Kshatryas, and
people of all other castes, issue out to behold the moon-like
countenance of Rama". Hearing the words of Bharata, Satrughna, the
slayer of enemies, divided the work amongst the servants, (saying),--"Do
ye level the high and low ground from Nandigram to (Ayodhya). Do ye
perfectly water the ground with cold water. Thereafter sprinkle all the
places with flowers and dried paddy; hoist up flags all over the city;
decorate all the houses, before the rising of the moon with garlands,
jewels, flowers of gold and things of five other colours. Let hundreds
of men watch the thorough-fares". Hearing the command of Satrughna,
issued out with delight Dhristi, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddartha,
Arthasadhaka, Asoka, Mantrapala and Sumantra. Thereupon issued out men
on horse back and in cars with thousands of mad elephants well-decked
with pennons and she-elephants with golden seats (on their backs). And
some heroes proceeded encircled by a thousand excellent steeds and
persons carrying _Sakti_, _Risthi_, maces and pennons and thousands of
infantry. Thereupon proceeded Sumitra and all other wives of Dacaratha
placing Kaucalya before them and seated in excellent conveyances. And
hearing of the return of his brother and attaining to delight, the
high-souled and pious Bharata, reduced with fasting, poorly, wearing
bark and skin of an antelope and conversant with religion, issued out to
receive back Rama in the company of his counsellors and encircled by the
twice-born ones, the people of diverse castes, his own relations and
kinsmen and ministers with garlands and _Modaka_[496] in their hands,
eulogized by the bards, having his arrival announced with the sound of
conchs and bugles and placing the sandals of his worshipful brother on
his head and taking white umbrella adorned with white garlands and white
_Chowries_ decked with gold and worthy of being used by the kings.
Thereupon with the sound of the horses' hoofs and cars, conchs and
bugles the earth shook. And the whole city went to Nandigram. And
beholding the Wind-god's son, Bharata said,--"Didst thou not resort to
the usual fickleness of the monkeys? We do not behold the worshipful
Rama, the descendant of Kakutstha--the slayer of foes. Nor do we behold
the monkeys assuming shapes at will". Having been addressed with those
words, Hanuman replied, communicating unto Bharata, having truth for his
prowess, the truth,--"Having reached the trees, covered by the favour of
Varadwaja, with fruits and flowers and pouring honey, the monkeys are
emitting noise like maddened black bees. O slayer of foes, this boon was
granted him (Rama) by Vasava. (Varadwaya) is treating him with his army
with all hospitality. Hear the dreadful noise of the delighted monkeys.
Methinks the monkey host hath crossed the river Gomati. Behold the huge
upheaval of dust towards the _Sala_ forest. Methinks the monkeys are
agitating the graceful _Sala_ forest. Behold there at the distance the
car resembling the Sun. This celestial car _Pashpaka_, constructed by
Brahma's mind, was obtained by the high-souled (Rama) after having slain
Ravana with his friends. This celestial car, resembling the newly risen
Sun, coursing at will and carrying Rama (was gained) by the favour of
the Giver of wealth. (There are) the two heroic brothers--the
descendants of Raghu with Yaidehi, the highly effulgent Sugriva and the
Rakshasa Bibhishana. Thereupon with the sound of "there is Rama" there
arose a joyous noise reaching the abode of the celestials from among
women, children, the young and the old. Thereupon descending upon the
earth from chariots, elephants and horses all people beheld him (Rama)
stationed on the car like unto the moon in the sky. And facing Raghava
and with folded hands Bharata delightedly worshipped him with agreeable
words, _Arghya_ and water to wash his feet. There appeared in the car
constructed by Brahma's mind the elder brother of Bharata having
expansive eyes like the immortal wielder of thunder-bolt. Thereupon
Bharata humbly saluted his brother Rama seated on the top of the car
like unto the Sun on the summit (of the mount Meru). And commanded by
Rama that excellent car drawn by ganders got down on the earth with
great velocity. And ascending that car, Bharata, having truth for his
prowess, reaching Rama, delighted, again bowed unto him. And raising
Bharata up who had been seen after a long time and placing him on his
lap Kakutstha, delighted, embraced him. There-upon Bharata, the slayer
of foes, bowed unto Vaidehi and welcomed Lakshmana. And the son of
Kaikeyi (then in turn) embraced Sugriva, Jambavana, Angada, Mainda,
Dwivida, Nila and Rishava. And he then embraced Sushena, Nala, Gabaksha,
Gandhamadana, Sarabha, and Panasa. And assuming human shapes, those
monkeys, assuming shapes at will, delightedly enquired after Bharata's
well-being. And embracing Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, the highly
effulgent prince Bharata, the foremost of the pious, said--" O Sugriva,
thou art our fifth brother. From brotherliness groweth friendship and
doing injury is the sign of an enemy". And Bharata then addressed
Bibhishana with soothing words--"It is by fortune that through your help
he hath accomplished such a difficult work". Thereupon the heroic
Satrughna saluting Rama and Lakshmana, respectfully bowed unto Sita. And
having approached his mother, pale and pulled down with grief, Rama
humbly touched her feet and enhanced her delight. And thereupon saluting
Sumitra, famed Kaikeyi and all his mothers he approached the priests.
Thereupon all the citizens with folded hands welcomed him
saying--"Welcome art thou, O thou of long arms! O thou the enhancer of
Kaucalya's joy!" And the elder brother of Bharata observed the folded
hands of the citizens like so many blown lotuses. And himself taking the
sandals of Rama, Bharata, conversant with piety, placed them at the feet
of that lord of men. Thereupon Bharata with folded hands spoke unto
Rama, saying--"This all thy kingdom, which thou didst leave to my care,
I return thee. Blessed is my birth to-day and accomplished is my desire,
since I behold thee again as king in Ayodhya after thy return. Do thou
examine thy wealth, treasury, palace and army. By thy favour I have
increased all these ten fold". Hearing Bharata speak in that wise and
beholding him devoted to his brother all the monkeys and the Rakshasa
Bibhishana shed tears. Thereupon placing Bharata, in delight, on his
lap, Raghava, with his army in that car, proceeded towards Bharata's
abode. And reaching Bharata's palace Raghava with his army descended
upon the earth. Thereupon Rama said to the excellent car--"Do thou (now)
go to _Vaisravana_--I do permit thee". Thereupon being thus commanded by
Rama, that excellent car, proceeding towards the north, reached the
abode of the Giver of wealth. That celestial car _Pushpaka_ had been
taken away by the Rakshasa (Ravana); but now at the words of Rama it
reached (again) the Giver of wealth. And touching the feet of his priest
the powerful Raghava sat on a separate and excellent seat like unto
Sakra, the lord of immortals (by the side of) _Vrihashpati_.

SECTION CXXX.


Thereupon having placed her palms on his head Bharata, the enhancer of
Kaikeyi's joy, spoke unto his elder brother Rama, having truth for his
prowess, saying,--"Abiding by my mother's request thou didst confer this
kingdom upon me; I do return thee the kingdom thou didst give me. Like
unto a young one unable to carry a heavy burden thrown off by a powerful
bull I am unable to carry this huge burden (of the kingdom). I do
consider this kingdom infested with thieves, difficult to govern, as it
is difficult to re-construct a bridge broken down by a powerful current
of water. As an ass cannot follow the course of a horse and a crow
cannot follow that of a gander, so I am unable, O hero, O slayer of
foes, to follow thy footsteps. If a tree planted in the inner appartment
of a house, growing huge with a big trunk and many branches, is dried up
as soon it blossoms without bearing fruits, his object for whom it is
planted, becomes fruitless. And this simili, O thou of long-arms, shall
prove good in thee, if dost thou not, our master, govern us, O lord of
men, who are thy servants. Let the world, O Raghava, behold thee
installed (to-day) like unto the powerful mid-day Sun burning in
effulgence. Do thou sleep and rise up with the sound of stringed
instruments, womens' girdles and _Nupuras_ and charming songs. Do thou
govern the people as long as the solar system exists and as far as the
earth extends". Hearing the words of Bharata, Rama the conqueror of
enemies' cities, saying,--"So be it" sat on an excellent seat. Thereupon
at the command of Satrughna, expert, skilful and quick-handed barbers
gathered round Raghava. At first, Bharata, the highly powerful
Lakshmana, Sugriva the lord of monkeys, and Bibhishana the lord of
Rakshasas bathed. Thereupon shorn of his matted hairs, bathed, with
paste excellent garlands and precious clothes on, he appeared there
shining in grace. The valiant and graceful Satrughna, the upholder of
the dignity of Ikshwaku race, himself got ready the dresses for Rama and
Lakshmana. And all the high-minded wives of Dacaratha with their own
hands decked Sita with various charming (ornaments). Thereupon Kaucalya,
delighted and fond of her son, herself with great care, decorated the
wives of monkeys. Thereupon at the words of Satrughna, the charioteer by
name Sumantra got ready the perfectly beautiful car. And beholding that
celestial car, bright as the fire of the sun, stationed before him,
Rama, having long arms, the conqueror of enemies' cities, ascended it.
Sugriva and Hanuman, graceful like Mahendra, bathed, dressed in
celestial clothes and wearing excellent _Kundalas_, proceeded (to view
the city). And then went Sita and all the wives of Sugriva decorated
with all ornaments and wearing excellent _Kundalas_, anxious to behold
the city. All the ministers of king Dacaratha in Ayodhya began to hold
consultation respectfully with the priest. Asoka, Vijaya and Siddhartha,
with undivided mind, consulted with each other about the welfare of Rama
as well as that of the city. (Thereupon they ordered the servants)
saying,--"Do ye collect materials necessary for the auspicious
installation of the high-souled (Rama) worthy of being crowned with
victory". The priest and the ministers having ordered thus all speedily
issued out of the city to behold Rama. Like unto the thousand-eyed Indra
in his car drawn by horses the blameless Rama, seated in his car,
proceeded towards the excellent city. Bharata took up the reins,
Satrughna held the umbrella and Lakshmana began to fan him on the head
with _Chowries_. And Bibhishana, the lord of Rakshasas standing on one
side, took up the white _Chowrie_ shining like the second moon. There
was audible the sweet encomium of Rama chanted by the crowd of ascetics
in the sky, the celestials and the Marutas. Thereupon the highly
effulgent Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, got up upon an elephant
named _Satrunyaya_ resembling a mountain. And riding nine thousand
elephants proceeded the monkeys assuming human shapes and adorned with
various ornaments. And with the music of conches and bugles that
foremost of men entered the city abounding in houses. (And the citizens)
beheld Raghava enter the city with a graceful person and seated in the
car. And they having bowed unto that descendant of Kakutstha were
welcomed by him. And they followed that high-souled one encircled by his
brothers. And surrounded by his courtiers, Brahmanas and subjects Rama
appeared beautiful like unto the Moon encircled by stars. And he went
proceeded by men who play on stringed instruments, by people with
_Karatal_ and Sustika in their hands and by men chanting delightedly
auspicious songs. Persons with Akshata and gold in their hands, kine,
girls, Brahmanas and persons with _Modaka_ in their hands went before
Rama. Thereupon before the ministers Rama began to describe the
friendship of Sugriva, the prowess of the Wind-god's son and the works
accomplished by the monkeys. And hearing of the works of the monkeys and
the prowess of the Rakshasas, the inhabitants of the city of Ayodhya
attained to astonishment. Having related thus (the works of the monkeys)
the graceful Rama encircled by the monkeys entered (the city of) Ayodhya
abounding in delighted and plump persons. Thereupon the citizens hoisted
up flags upon every house and he reached the picturesque abode of his
ancestors inhabited by the descendants of Ikshwaku. And having reached
and entered his ancestral palace and bowed unto Kaucalya, Sumitra and
Kaikeyi, the high-souled prince, the enhancer of the joy of the
descendants of Raghu, addressed Bharata the foremost of the pious, with
sweet words instinct with meaning, saying,--"Do thou set apart for
Sugriva my huge and excellent palace abounding in pearls and
_Vaidurjas_". Hearing those words, Bharata, having truth for his
prowess, taking Sugriva by the hand, conducted him to the palace. And
commanded by Satrughna, (servants) speedily entered (that palace) with
oil, lamps, bedsteads and beddings. Thereupon the highly effulgent
younger brother of Raghava spoke unto Sugriva, saying,--"Do thou, O
lord, order some (to bring water) for Rama's installation". And Sugriva
conferred upon four leading monkeys four golden jars crested with
diverse jewels and said to them,--"Do ye so conduct, O monkeys, that ye
may return by the dawn with the jars filled with the water of the four
oceans". Being thus addressed by the high-souled (Sugriva) the monkeys
resembling the elephants speedily rose up in the welkin like unto
quick-coursing vultures. Jambavana, Hanuman, the monkey Vegadarshi and
Rishabha brought the jars filled with water from five hundred rivers.
Sushena, gifted with prowess, brought that jar crested with gems, filled
with water from the Eastern Ocean. And Rishabha speedily brought water
from the Southern Ocean. And Gabaya brought, from the great Western
Ocean in that golden jar, water perfumed with the fragrance of red
sandal and camphor. And the virtuous-souled Wind-god's son, gifted with
all accomplishments and the prowess of Garuda and Wind-god, brought,
speedily from the Northern Ocean, water in that jewelled jar. And
beholding water thus brought by the leading monkeys for the installation
of Rama, Satrughna, with his ministers, communicated that unto the
leading priests and friends. Thereupon the self-controlled Vasishtha,
striken in years, along with other Brahmanas placed Rama with Sita on a
jewelled seat. Vasishtha, Vijaya, Javali, Katyayana, Goutama and
Bamadeva, sprinkled that foremost of men, with clear and fragrant water
as Vasus did the thousand eyed Vasava. (He was then sprinkled by) the
_Rittigas_, Brahmanas, maidens ministers, soldiers and the merchants all
delighted. (There-upon) with the juice of _Oshadhis_[497] (he was
sprinkled by) the celestials stationed in the sky, the deities presiding
over the four quarters and all other celestials collected. And having
placed him on a seat crested with various jewels in the arena decorated
with gold, various jewels and rich parapharnalia, (he placed on his
head) the jewelled crown made by Brahma, brilliant and with which in the
days of yore Manu and other kings, born in his race, were installed. And
being decked by the high-souled Vasishtha with that crown, Raghava was
afterwards dressed with the celestial garments by the _Rittigas_.[498]
And Satrughna held the white and excellent umbrella and Sugriva the lord
of monkeys took the white _Chowrie_. And Bibhishana the lord of
Rakshasas took up another _Chowrie_ resembling the moon. And the wind
commanded by Vasava conferred upon Raghava, a garland of a hundred
golden lotuses, shining in their native lustre. And the wind commanded
by Sakra conferred upon that lord of men a jewelled garland crested with
diverse gems. The intelligent and worthy Rama being installed the
celestials and the Gandharvas sang and the Apsaras danced. The earth was
filled with crops, the trees with fruits and the flowers were fragrant
on the occassion of Raghava's installation. And that foremost of men
conferred upon the twice-born ones one million of horses, a hundred
thousand cows and a hundred thousand bulls. And Raghava again conferred
upon the Brahmanas thirty _crores_ of golden coins and diverse costly
ornaments and clothes. Thereupon that lord of men conferred upon Sugriva
a celestial garland brilliant like the rays of the Sun and crested with
gold and jewels. And he, gifted with intelligence, conferred upon
Angada, Vali's son, two _Angadas_[499] brilliant as the rays of the moon
and made of _Baidurja_. And Rama conferred upon Sita an excellent pearl
necklace crested with precious jems, celestial clothes and various
excellent ornaments. And taking off the necklace from her person
Vaidehi, the daughter of king Janaka, conferred it upon the Wind-god's
son remembering the services (rendered by him) and cast her looks again
and again upon her lord and the monkeys. And beholding that (Rama)
capable of reading the gestures, spoke unto the daughter of king Janaka,
saying--"O fortunate and beautiful lady, do thou confer this necklace
upon him with whom thou art pleased". Thereupon the lotus-eyed (Sita)
conferred that upon the Wind god's son. And Hanuman, the foremost of
monkeys, in whom perpetually exist, energy, forgiveness, fame,
skillfullness, prowess, humility, tactics, manliness, valiance and
intellect, appeared with that necklace like a mountain beautified with
the rays of the moon and white clouds. And all other elderly and leading
monkeys were respectively honoured with clothes and ornaments. And being
honoured by Rama of unwearied actions with enough of jewels and other
wished-for objects, Bibhishana, Sugriva, Hanuman, Jambavan and other
leading monkeys, delighted, returned to their respective habitations.
Thereupon, the lord of earth and the slayer of foes conferred, all
wished-for things, upon Dwivida, Mainda and Nila. And beholding (the
installation of Rama) the high-souled monkeys, taking leave of the lord
of earth, went to Kishkindha. And beholding the inauguration of Rama,
Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys, honored by Rama, repaired to the city
of Kishkindha. And having obtained his own kingdom, the greatly famous
and virtuous-souled Bibhishana, with all the Rakshasas, repaired to the
city of Lanka. Having slain his foes, the highly generous and glorious
Rama, ruled in great delight, the kingdom extending all over the earth.
And Rama, fond of the pious, spoke unto Lakshmana, conversant with
piety; saying--"O thou conversant with piety, do thou with me and
four-fold forces, govern this kingdom, ruled by our predecessors. Like
unto our ancestors do thou now carry the burden of an associate in the
throne". When the son of Sumitra did not accept the heir apparentship
albeit solicited earnestly again and again, the high-souled (Rama)
conferred upon Bharata that dignity. And that son of king performed
various sacrifices such as _Paundarika_,[500] _Aswamedha_,[501]
_Bajimedha_ and others. And governing the kingdon for ten thousand years
Raghava performed ten horse-sacrifices with excellent horses and profuse
presents. And that highly powerful Rama, having his arms extended up to
the knee-joint, having a spacious breast and Lakshmana as his attendant,
ruled the earth (in this wise). And obtaining that excellent kingdom,
the virtuous-souled Raghava performed many sacrifices with his sons,
brothers and friends. And Rama governing the kingdom, the widows were
not distressed and there was no fear from voracious animals or from
diseases. The people were saved from the thieves and there was no other
trouble. And the old were not constrained to perform the funeral
ceremonies of the children. All were delighted and devoted to pious
observances. And beholding Rama they did not envy one another. And Rama
governing the kingdom, (people) lived for a thousand years and had a
thousand children,--they were freed from diseases and sorrow. And the
trees bore fruits and flowers perpetually--there were showers at will
and the wind blew pleasant. And the people delighted engaged in their
respective works and the subjects grew pious and truthful, under Rama's
regime, and were devoted to the observance of all pious works and gifted
with all auspicious marks. And Rama ruled the kingdom for ten thousand
years. And this sacred Epic, the first of its kind, affording piety,
fame, and long life, and describing the conquest of the kings, was
composed by Valmiki in the days of yore. He, who on this earth, shall
hear (this story) shall be divested of sins. People, wishing for
children, shall obtain the same and those, wishing for riches, shall get
by them. Thus people on this earth shall attain to their wished-for
objects hearing of this Rama's installation--the king may conquer the
earth and subdue his foes. Females may obtain sons (in the same way) as
Kaucalya gave birth to Rama, Sumitra to Lakshmana and Kaikeyi to
Bharata. Hearing the story of this work describing the victory of Rama
of unwearied actions one may attain to a long life. He, who with
devotion and having his anger subdued, shall hear the story of this epic
written by Valmiki in the days of yore shall get over all troubles. And
hearing the story of the Epic composed by Valmiki in the days of yore,
one living in foreign countries, shall return home and enjoy in the
company of his friends. Hearing this people shall secure all their
wished-for objects from Raghava and the celestials shall be greatly
delighted. When this book is kept in a house it becomes free from the
disturbance of evil spirits. Hearing this a king may conquer the earth,
and one living in a foreign country fareth well. If a female, during her
monthly course, hears the story, she shall give birth to an excellent
son. By reading and worshipping this ancient history people are freed
from all sins and attain to a long life. The Kshatryas, bending low
their heads, should hear this daily from the Brahmanas. Hearing or
reading the whole of Ramayana, forsooth shall people get sons and
riches. Rama is ever pleased with him. He is the ever-existing
Vishnu--the first God, the huge-armed Hari, Narayana and Lord. This
ancient work produceth such fruits. May good betide ye. Do ye openly
declare that Vishnu's prowess may increase. The celestials shall be
greatly delighted for reading or hearing this story of Rama and the
progenitors shall be always pleased. Those, who shall write this story
of Rama first recorded by the Rishi (Valmiki) shall reach the region of
Brahma. Hearing this people attain to, on this earth, multiplied
relations, increased wealth and crops, beautiful wives, excellent
happiness, and the accomplishment of all desires. They attain to long
life, health, fame, intellect, prowess, and good brothers. Therefore it
behoveth those good men, who wish for prosperity, to hear this story
perpetually.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg(tm)


Project Gutenberg(tm) is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg(tm)'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg(tm) collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg(tm) and future generations. To
learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org .

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation


Project Gutenberg(tm) depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate



Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic
works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg(tm)
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg(tm) eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg(tm) eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

    http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg(tm),
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
