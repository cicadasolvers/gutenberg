                    PREFACE


The Latin Club in secondary schools is the result of the incessant
demand that our Latin instruction must be vivified. Many teachers feel
the need of supplementary work in their Latin teaching, but they have
been handicapped because of a lack of material as well as a lack of
time. This is especially true of the teacher in the small town. To help
meet this demand is the purpose of this book.

The programs have purposely been made too long for one session in order
that the teacher may have some choice in selection, and that, in case
all references are not accessible, enough may be secured to insure a
reasonably varied program.

I would suggest that the Club purchase as many Perry pictures and Berlin
photographs of classical subjects as possible and that its members
cooeperate with the city library board for the purchase of such books
as are essential, in case there is no school fund available for this
purpose. Some high school alumnus in whose heart there is appreciation
of Rome's gift to us might present a book to his Alma Mater. Another
might offer some suitable magazines, properly bound.

Of a Latin Club, as of most school work, it may be said that _usus est
optimus magister_, and especially applicable in this connection are the
words of Horace: _Dimidium facti, qui coepit_.

A PLEA FOR THE CLASSICS[1]

A Boston gentleman declares,
  By all the gods above, below,
That our degenerate sons and heirs
  Must let their Greek and Latin go!
Forbid, O Fate, we loud implore,
  A dispensation harsh as that;
What! wipe away the sweets of yore;
  The dear "_amo, amas, amat?_"

The sweetest hour the student knows
  Is not when poring over French,
Or twisted in Teutonic throes,
  Upon a hard collegiate bench;
'Tis when on roots and kais and gars
  He feeds his soul and feels it glow,
Or when his mind transcends the stars
  With "_Zoa mou, sas agapo!_"

So give our bright, ambitious boys
  An inkling of these pleasures, too--
A little smattering of the joys
  Their dead and buried fathers knew;
And let them sing--while glorying that
  Their sires so sang, long years ago--
The songs "_amo, amas, amat_"
  And "_Zoa mou, sas agapo!_"

    --Eugene Field

ON AN OLD LATIN TEXT BOOK

I remember the very day when the schoolmaster gave it to me.... And I
remember that the rather stern and aquiline face of our teacher relaxed
into mildness for a moment. Both we and our books must have looked very
fresh and new to him, though we may all be a little battered now; at
least, my _New Latin Tutor_ is. It is a very precious book, and it
should be robed in choice Turkey morocco, were not the very covers too
much a part of the association to be changed. For between them I
gathered the seed-grain of many harvests of delight; through this low
archway I first looked upon the immeasurable beauty of words....

What liquid words were these: _aqua_, _aura_, _unda_! All English poetry
that I had yet learned by heart--it is only children who learn by heart,
grown people "commit to memory"--had not so awakened the vision of what
literature might mean. Thenceforth all life became ideal....

Then human passion, tender, faithful, immortal, came also by and
beckoned. "But let me die," she said. "Thus, thus it delights me to go
under the shades." Or that infinite tenderness, the stronger even for
its opening moderation of utterance, the last sigh of Aeneas after
Dido,--

  Nec me meminisse pigebit Elissam
  Dum memor ipse mihi, dum spiritus hos regit artus....

Or, with more definite and sublime grandeur, the vast forms of Roman
statesmanship appear: "Today, Romans, you behold the commonwealth, the
lives of you all, estates, fortunes, wives and children, and the seat of
this most renowned empire, this most fortunate and beautiful city,
preserved and restored to you by the distinguished love of the immortal
gods, and by my toils, counsels, and dangers."

What great thoughts were found within these pages, what a Roman vigor
was in these maxims! "It is Roman to do and suffer
bravely." "It is sweet and glorious to die for one's country." "He that
gives himself up to pleasure, is not worthy the name of a man."...

There was nothing harsh or stern in this book, no cynicism, no
indifference; but it was a flower-garden of lovely out-door allusions, a
gallery of great deeds; and as I have said before, it formed the child's
first real glimpse into the kingdom of words.

I was once asked by a doctor of divinity, who was also the overseer of a
college, whether I ever knew any one to look back with pleasure upon his
early studies in Latin and Greek. It was like being asked if one looked
back with pleasure on summer mornings and evenings. No doubt those
languages, like all others, have fared hard at the hands of pedants; and
there are active boys who hate all study, and others who love the
natural sciences alone. Indeed, it is a hasty assumption, that the
majority of boys hate Latin and Greek. I find that most college
graduates, at least, retain some relish for the memory of such studies,
even if they have utterly lost the power to masticate or digest them.
"Though they speak no Greek, they love the sound on't." Many a
respectable citizen still loves to look at his Horace or Virgil on the
shelf where it has stood undisturbed for a dozen years; he looks, and
thinks that he too lived in Arcadia.... The books link him with culture,
and universities, and the traditions of great scholars.

On some stormy Sunday, he thinks, he will take them down. At length he
tries it; he handles the volume awkwardly, as he does his infant; but it
is something to be able to say that neither book nor baby has been
actually dropped. He likes to know that there is a tie between him and
each of these possessions, though he is willing, it must be owned, to
leave the daily care of each in more familiar hands....

I must honestly say that much of the modern outcry against classical
studies seems to me to be (as in the case of good Dr. Jacob Bigelow) a
frank hostility to literature itself, as the supposed rival of science;
or a willingness (as in Professor Atkinson's
case) to tolerate modern literature, while discouraging the study of the
ancient. Both seem to commit the error of drawing their examples of
abuse from England, and applying their warnings to America.... Because
the House of Commons was once said to care more for a false quantity in
Latin verse than in English morals, shall we visit equal indignation on
a House of Representatives that had to send for a classical dictionary
to find out who Thersites was?...

Granted, that foreign systems of education may err by insisting on the
arts of literary structure too much; think what we should lose by
dwelling on them too little! The magic of mere words; the mission of
language; the worth of form as well as of matter; the power to make a
common thought immortal in a phrase, so that your fancy can no more
detach the one from the other than it can separate the soul and body of
a child; it was the veiled half revelation of these things that made
that old text-book forever fragrant to me. There are in it the still
visible traces of wild flowers which I used to press between the pages,
on the way to school; but it was the pressed flowers of Latin poetry
that were embalmed there first. These are blossoms that do not fade.

    --Thomas Wentworth Higginson


SAINT AUGUSTINE'S LOVE OF LATIN

Andrew Lang, in his _Adventures Among Books_, writes:

"Saint Augustine, like Sir Walter Scott at the University of Edinburgh,
was 'The Greek Dunce.' Both of these great men, to their sorrow and
loss, absolutely and totally declined to learn Greek. 'But what the
reason was why I hated the Greek language, while I was taught it, being
a child, I do not yet understand.' The Saint was far from being alone in
that distaste, and he who writes loathed Greek like poison--till he came
to Homer. Latin the Saint loved, except 'when reading, writing, and
casting of accounts was taught in Latin, which I held not far less
painful or penal than the very Greek. I wept for Dido's death, who made
herself away with the sword,' he declares, 'and even so, the saying that
two and two makes four was an ungrateful song in mine ears, whereas the
wooden horse full of armed men, the burning of Troy, and the very Ghost
of Creusa, was a most delightful spectacle of vanity.'"


THE WATCH OF THE OLD GODS

Were the old gods watching yet,
From their cloudy summits afar,
At evening under the evening star,
After the star is set,
Would they see in these thronging streets,
Where the life of the city beats
With endless rush and strain,
Men of a better mold,
Nobler in heart and brain,
Than the men of three thousand years ago,
In the pagan cities old,
O'er which the lichens and ivy grow?

Would they not see as they saw
In the younger days of the race,
The dark results of broken law,
In the bent form and brutal face
Of the slave of passions as old as earth,
And young as the infants of last night's birth?
Alas! the old gods no longer keep
Their watch from the cloudy steep;
But, though all on Olympus lie dead
Yet the smoke of commerce still rolls
From the sacrifice of souls,
To the heaven that bends overhead.


OLD AND NEW ROME

Still, as we saunter down the crowded street,
  On our own thoughts intent, and plans and pleasures,
For miles and miles beneath our idle feet,
  Rome buries from the day yet unknown treasures.

The whole world's alphabet, in every line
  Some stirring page of history she recalls,--
Her Alpha is the Prison Mamertine,
  Her Omega, St. Paul's, without the walls.

Above, beneath, around, she weaves her spells,
  And ruder hands unweave them all in vain:
Who once within her fascination dwells,
  Leaves her with but one thought--to come again.

So cast thy obol into Trevi's fountain--
  Drink of its waters, and, returning home,
Pray that by land or sea, by lake or mountain,
  "All roads alike may lead at last to Rome."

    --Herman Merivale


THE FALL OF ROME

Rome ruled in all her matchless pride,
  Queen of the world, an empire-state;
Her eagles conquered far and wide;
  Her word was law, her will was fate.

Within her immemorial walls
  The temples of the gods looked down;
Her forum echoed with the calls
  To greater conquest and renown.

All wealth, all splendor, and all might
  The world could give, before her lay;
She dreamed not there could come a night
  To dim the glory of her day.

Rome perished: Legions could not save,
  Nor wealth, nor might, nor majesty,--
The Roman had become a slave,
  But the barbarian was free.

    --Arthur Chamberlain


A CHRISTMAS HYMN

It was the calm and silent night!
Seven hundred years and fifty-three
Had Rome been growing up to might,
And now was queen of land and sea.
No sound was heard of clashing wars--
Peace brooded o'er the hushed domain:
Apollo, Pallas, Jove and Mars
Held undisturbed their ancient reign,
In the solemn midnight,
      Centuries ago.

'Twas in the calm and silent night!
The senator of haughty Rome
Impatient, urged his chariot's flight,
From lordly revel rolling home:
Triumphal arches, gleaming, swell
His breast with thoughts of boundless sway:
What recked the Roman what befell
A paltry province far away,
In the solemn midnight,
      Centuries ago?

Within that province far away
Went plodding home a weary boor;
A streak of light before him lay,
Falling through a half shut stable-door
Across his path. He passed--for naught
Told what was going on within:
How keen the stars, his only thought--
The air how calm, and cold and thin
In the solemn midnight,
      Centuries ago!

Oh, strange indifference! low and high
Drowsed over common joys and cares;
The earth was still--but knew not why,
The world was listening, unawares.
How calm a moment may precede
One that shall thrill the world forever!
To that still moment, none would heed,
Man's doom was linked no more to sever--
In the solemn midnight,
      Centuries ago!

It is the calm and silent night!
A thousand bells ring out, and throw
Their joyous peals abroad, and smite
The darkness--charmed and holy now!
The night that erst no name had worn,
To it a happy name is given;
For in that stable lay, new-born,
The peaceful prince of earth and heaven,
In the solemn midnight,
      Centuries ago!

    --Alfred Dommett


ROMAN GIRL'S SONG

Rome, Rome! thou art no more
  As thou hast been!
On thy seven hills of yore
  Thou satt'st a queen.

Thou hadst thy triumphs then
  Purpling the street,
Leaders and sceptred men
  Bow'd at thy feet.

They that thy mantle wore,
  As gods were seen--
Rome, Rome! thou art no more
  As thou hast been!

Rome! thine imperial brow
  Never shall rise:
What hast thou left thee now?--
  Thou hast thy skies!

Blue, deeply blue, they are,
  Gloriously bright!
Veiling thy wastes afar,
  With color'd light.

Thou hast the sunset's glow,
  Rome, for thy dower,
Flushing tall cypress bough,
  Temple and tower!

And all sweet sounds are thine,
  Lovely to hear,
While night, o'er tomb and shrine
  Rests darkly clear.

Many a solemn hymn,
  By starlight sung,
Sweeps through the arches dim,
  Thy wrecks among.

Many a flute's low swell,
  On thy soft air
Lingers, and loves to dwell
  With summer there.

Thou hast the south's rich gift
  Of sudden song--
A charmed fountain, swift,
  Joyous and strong.

Thou hast fair forms that move
  With queenly tread;
Thou hast proud fanes above
  Thy mighty dead.

Yet wears thy Tiber's shore
  A mournful mien:
Rome, Rome! Thou art no more
  As thou hast been!

    --Mrs. Hemans


CAPRI

Rising from the purpling water
  With her brow of stone,
Sprite or nymph or Triton's daughter,
Rising from the purpling water,
  Capri sits alone--

Sits and looks across the billow
  Now the day is done
Resting on her rocky pillow
Sits and looks across the billow
  Toward the setting sun.

Misty visions trooping sadly
  Glimmer through her tears,
Shapes of men contending madly,--
Misty visions trooping sadly
  From the vanished years.

Here Tiberius from his palace
  On the headland gray
Hurls his foes with gleeful malice,
Proud Tiberius at his palace
  Murd'ring men for play.

There Lamarque's recruits advancing
  Scale yon rocky spot,
'Neath the moon their bright steel glancing,
See Lamarque's recruits advancing
  Through a storm of shot.

But today the goat bells' tinkle
  And the vespers chime,
Vineyards shade each rock-hewn wrinkle,
And today the goat bells' tinkle
  Marks a happier time.

Soft the olive groves are gleaming,
  War has found surcease,
And as Capri sits a-dreaming
Soft the olive groves are gleaming,
  Crowning her with peace.

    --Walter Taylor Field


PALLADIUM

Set where the upper streams of Simois flow
  Was the Palladium, high 'mid rock and wood;
And Hector was in Ilium, far below,
  And fought, and saw it not--but there it stood!

It stood, and sun and moonshine rain'd their light
  On the pure columns of its glen-built hall.
Backward and forward rolled the waves of fight
  Round Troy,--but while this stood, Troy could not fall.

So, in its lovely moonlight, lives the soul.
  Mountains surround it, and sweet virgin air;
Cold plashing, past it, crystal waters roll;
  We visit it by moments, ah, too rare!

Men will renew the battle in the plain
  Tomorrow; red with blood will Xanthus be;
Hector and Ajax will be there again,
  Helen will come upon the wall to see.

Then we shall rust in shade, or shine in strife,
  And fluctuate 'twixt blind hopes and blind despairs,
And fancy that we put forth all our life,
  And never know how with the soul it fares.

Still doth the soul, from its lone fastness high,
  Upon our life a ruling effluence send;
And when it fails, fight as we will, we die,
  And while it lasts, we cannot wholly end.

    --Matthew Arnold


AFTER CONSTRUING

Lord Caesar, when you sternly wrote
  The story of your grim campaigns
And watched the ragged smoke-wreath float
  Above the burning plains,

Amid the impenetrable wood,
  Amid the camp's incessant hum
At eve, beside the tumbling flood,
  In high Avaricum,

You little recked, imperious head,
  When shrilled your shattering trumpets' noise,
Your frigid sections would be read
  By bright-eyed English boys.

Ah me! Who penetrates today
  The secret of your deep designs?
Your sovereign visions, as you lay
  Amid the sleeping lines?

The Mantuan singer pleading stands;
  From century to century
He leans and reaches wistful hands,
  And cannot bear to die.

But you are silent, secret, proud,
  No smile upon your haggard face,
As when you eyed the murderous crowd
  Beside the statue's base.

I marvel: That Titanic heart
  Beats strongly through the arid page,
And we, self-conscious sons of art,
  In this bewildering age,

Like dizzy revellers stumbling out
  Upon the pure and peaceful night,
Are sobered into troubled doubt,
  As swims across our sight,

The ray of that sequestered sun,
  Far in the illimitable blue,--
The dream of all you left undone,
  Of all you dared to do.

    --Arthur Christoher Benson


A ROMAN MIRROR

They found it in her hollow marble bed,
There where the numberless dead cities sleep,
They found it lying where the spade struck deep
A broken mirror by a maiden dead.

These things--the beads she wore about her throat,
Alternate blue and amber, all untied,
A lamp to light her way, and on one side
The toll men pay to that strange ferry-boat.

No trace today of what in her was fair!
Only the record of long years grown green
Upon the mirror's lustreless dead sheen,
Grown dim at last, when all else withered there

Dead, broken, lustreless! It keeps for me
One picture of that immemorial land,
For oft as I have held thee in my hand
The chill bronze brightens, and I dream to see

A fair face gazing in thee wondering wise
And o'er one marble shoulder all the while
Strange lips that whisper till her own lips smile
And all the mirror laughs about her eyes.

It was well thought to set thee there, so she
Might smooth the windy ripples of her hair
And knot their tangled waywardness or ere
She stood before the queen Persephone.

And still it may be where the dead folk rest
She holds a shadowy mirror to her eyes,
And looks upon the changelessness, and sighs
And sets the dead land lilies in her hand.

    --Rennell Rodd


THE DOOM OF THE SLOTHFUL

When through the dolorous city of damned souls
  The Florentine with Vergil took his way,
A dismal marsh they passed, whose fetid shoals
  Held sinners by the myriad. Swollen and grey,
  Like worms that fester in the foul decay
Of sweltering carrion, these bad spirits sank
Chin-deep in stagnant slime and ooze that stank.

Year after year forever--year by year,
  Through billions of the centuries that lie
Like specks of dust upon the dateless sphere
  Of heaven's eternity, they cankering sigh
  Between the black waves and the starless sky;
And daily dying have no hope to gain
By death or change or respite of their pain.

What was their crime, you ask? Nay, listen: "We
  Were sullen--sad what time we drank the light,
And delicate air, that all day daintily
  Is cheered by sunshine; for we bore black night
  And murky smoke of sloth, in God's despite,
Within our barren souls, by discontent
From joy of all fair things and wholesome pent:

Therefore in this low Hell from jocund sight
  And sound He bans us; and as there we grew
Pallid with idleness, so here a blight
  Perpetual rots with slow-corroding dew
  Our poisonous carcase, and a livid hue
Corpse-like o'erspreads these sodden limbs that take
And yield corruption to the loathly lake."

    --John Addington Symonds


HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE

_Andromache_

Will Hector leave me for the fatal plain,
Where, fierce with vengeance for Patroclus slain,
  Stalks Peleus' ruthless son?
Who, when thou glid'st amid the dark abodes,
To hurl the spear and to revere the gods,
  Shall teach thine Orphan One?

_Hector_

Woman and wife beloved--cease thy tears;
My soul is nerved--the war-clang in my ears!
  Be mine in life to stand
Troy's bulwark!--fighting for our hearths, to go
In death, exulting to the streams below,
  Slain for my father-land!

_Andromache_

No more I hear thy martial footsteps fall--
Thine arms shall hang, dull trophies, on the wall--
  Fallen the stem of Troy!
Thou go'st where slow Cocytus wanders--where
Love sinks in Lethe, and the sunless air
  Is dark to light and joy!

_Hector_

Longing and thought--yea, all I feel and think
May in the silent sloth of Lethe sink,
  But my love not!
Hark, the wild swarm is at the walls! I hear!
Gird on my sword--Belov'd one, dry the tear--
  Lethe for love is not!

    --Schiller


ENCELADUS

Under Mount Etna he lies,
 It is slumber, it is not death;
For he struggles at times to arise,
And above him the lurid skies
 Are hot with his fiery breath.

The crags are piled on his breast,
 The earth is heaped on his head;
But the groans of his wild unrest,
Though smothered and half suppressed,
 Are heard, and he is not dead.

And the nations far away
  Are watching with eager eyes;
They talk together and say,
"Tomorrow, perhaps today,
  Enceladus will arise!"

And the old gods, the austere
  Oppressors in their strength,
Stand aghast and white with fear
At the ominous sounds they hear,
  And tremble, and mutter, "At length!"

Ah me! for the land that is sown
  With the harvest of despair!
Where the burning cinders, blown
From the lips of the overthrown
  Enceladus, fill the air.

Where ashes are heaped in drifts
  Over vineyard and field and town,
Whenever he starts and lifts
His head through the blackened rifts
  Of the crags that keep him down.

See, see! the red light shines!
  'Tis the glare of his awful eyes!
And the storm-wind shouts through the pines,
Of Alps and of Apennines,
  "Enceladus, arise!"

    --Henry W. Longfellow


NIL ADMIRARI

When Horace in Venusian groves
  Was scribbling wit or sipping "Massic,"
Or singing those delicious loves
  Which after ages reckon classic,
He wrote one day--'twas no vagary--
These famous words:--_Nil admirari!_

"Wonder at nothing!" said the bard;
  A kingdom's fall, a nation's rising,
A lucky or a losing card,
  Are really not at all surprising;
However men or manners vary,
Keep cool and calm: _Nil admirari!_

If kindness meet a cold return;
  If friendship prove a dear delusion;
If love, neglected, cease to burn,
  Or die untimely of profusion,--
Such lessons well may make us wary,
But needn't shock: _Nil admirari!_

Ah! when the happy day we reach
 When promisers are ne'er deceivers;
When parsons practice what they preach,
  And seeming saints are all believers,
Then the old maxim you may vary,
And say no more, _Nil admirari!_

    --John G. Saxe


PERDIDI DIEM

  The Emperor Titus, at the close of a day in which he had neither
  gained any knowledge nor conferred benefit, was accustomed to
  exclaim, "Perdidi diem," "I have lost a day."

  Why art thou sad, thou of the sceptred hand?
The rob'd in purple, and the high in state?
  Rome pours her myriads forth, a vassal band,
And foreign powers are crouching at thy gate;
Yet dost thou deeply sigh, as if oppressed by fate.

  "_Perdidi diem!_"--Pour the empire's treasure,
Uncounted gold, and gems of rainbow dye;
  Unlock the fountains of a monarch's pleasure
To lure the lost one back. I heard a sigh--
One hour of parted time, a world is poor to buy.

  "_Perdidi diem!_"--'Tis a mournful story,
Thus in the ear of pensive eve to tell,
  Of morning's firm resolves, the vanish'd glory,
Hope's honey left within the withering bell
And plants of mercy dead, that might have bloomed so well.

  Hail, self-communing Emperor, nobly wise!
There are, who thoughtless haste to life's last goal.
  There are, who time's long squandered wealth despise.
_Perdidi vitam_ marks their finished scroll,
When Death's dark angel comes to claim the startled soul.

    --Mrs. Sigourney


JUPITER AND HIS CHILDREN

    A Classic Fable

Once, on sublime Olympus, when
Great Jove, the sire of gods and men,
Was looking down on this our Earth,
And marking the increasing dearth
Of pious deeds and noble lives,
While vice abounds and meanness thrives,--
He straight determined to efface
At one fell swoop the thankless race
Of human kind. "Go!" said the King
Unto his messenger, "and bring
The vengeful Furies; be it theirs,
Unmindful of their tears and prayers,
These wretches,--hateful from their birth,--
To wipe from off the face of earth!"
The message heard, with torch of flame
And reeking sword, Alecto came,
And by the beard of Pluto swore
The human race should be no more!
But Jove, relenting thus to see
The direst of the murderous three,
And hear her menace, bade her go
Back to the murky realms below.
"Be mine the cruel task!" he said,
And, at a word, a bolt he sped,
Which, falling in a desert place,
Left all unhurt the human race!
Grown bold and bolder, wicked men
Wax worse and worse, until again
The stench to high Olympus came,
And all the gods began to blame
The monarch's weak indulgence,--_they_
Would crush the knaves without delay!
  At this, the ruler of the air
Proceeds a tempest to prepare,
Which, dark and dire, he swiftly hurled
In raging fury on the world!
But not where human beings dwell
(So Jove provides) the tempest fell.
And still the sin and wickedness
Of men grew more, instead of less:
Whereat the gods declare, at length,
For thunder bolts of greater strength
Which Vulcan soon, at Jove's command,
Wrought in his forge with dexterous hand.
Now from the smithy's glowing flame
Two different sorts of weapons came:
To _hit_ the mark was one designed;
As sure to _miss_, the other kind.
The second sort the Thunderer threw,
Which not a human being slew;
But roaring loudly, hurtled wide
On forest-top and mountain-side!

MORAL

What means this ancient tale? That _Jove_
In wrath still felt a parent's love:
Whatever crimes he may have done,
The father yearns to spare the son.

    --John G. Saxe


THE PRAYER OF SOCRATES

_Socrates_

Ere we leave this friendly sky,
And cool Ilyssus flowing by,
Change the shrill cicala's song
For the clamor of the throng,
Let us make a parting prayer
To the gods of earth and air.

_Phaedrus_

My wish, O Friend, accords with thine,
Say thou the prayer, it shall be mine.

_Socrates_

This then, I ask, O thou beloved Pan,
And all ye other gods: Help, as ye can,
That I may prosper in the inner man;

Grant ye that what I have or yet may win
Of those the outer things may be akin
And constantly at peace within;

May I regard the wise the rich, and care
Myself for no more gold, as my earth-share,
Than he who's of an honest heart can bear.

    --John H. Finley


BY THE ROMAN ROAD

  "Poetry and paganism do not mix very well nowadays. The Hellenism of
  our versifiers is, as a rule, not Greek; it is derived partly from
  Swinburne and partly from Pater. But now and then there comes a poet
  who has real appreciation of the beauty of classic days; who can
  express sincerely and vividly the haunting charm of Greek or Roman
  culture. Such an one is the anonymous writer of these lines, which
  appeared in the London _Punch_."

The wind it sang in the pine-tops, it sang like a humming harp;
The smell of the sun on the bracken was wonderful sweet and sharp.
As sharp as the piney needles, as sweet as the gods were good,
For the wind it sung of the old gods, as I came through the wood!
It sung how long ago the Romans made a road,
And the gods came up from Italy and found them an abode.

It sang of the wayside altars (the pine-tops sighed like the surf),
Of little shrines uplifted, of stone and scented turf,
Of youths divine and immortal, of maids as white as the snow
That glimmered among the thickets a mort of years ago!
All in the cool of dawn, all in the twilight gray,
The gods came up from Italy along the Roman way.

The altar smoke it has drifted and faded afar on the hill;
No wood-nymphs haunt the hollows; the reedy pipes are still;
No more the youth Apollo shall walk in his sunshine clear;
No more the maid Diana shall follow the fallow-deer
(The woodmen grew so wise, the woodmen grew so old,
The gods went back to Italy--or so the story's told!).

But the woods are full of voices and of shy and secret things
The badger down by the brook-side, the flick of a woodcock's wings,
The plump of a falling fir-cone, the pop of the sunripe pods,
And the wind that sings in the pine-tops the song of the ancient gods--
The song of the wind that says the Romans made a road,
And the gods came up from Italy and found them an abode!


A NYMPH'S LAMENT

O Sister Nymphs, how shall we dance or sing
Remembering
What was and is not? How sing any more
Now Aphrodite's rosy reign is o'er?
For on the forest-floor
Our feet fall wearily the summer long,
The whole year long:
No sudden goddess through the rushes glides,
No eager God among the laurels hides;
Jove's eagle mopes beside an empty throne,
Persephone and Ades sit alone,
By Lethe's hollow shore.
And hear not any more
Echoed from poplar-tree to poplar-tree,
The voice of Orpheus making sweetest moan
For lost Eurydice.
The Fates walk all alone
In empty kingdoms, where is none to fear
Shaking of any spear.
Even the ghosts are gone
From lightless fields of mint and euphrasy:
There sings no wind in any willow-tree,
And shadowy flute-girls wander listlessly
Down to the shore where Charon's empty boat,
As shadowed swan doth float,
Rides all as listlessly, with none to steer.
A shrunken stream is Lethe's water wan
Unsought of any man:
Grass Ceres sowed by alien hands is mown,
And now she seeks Persephone alone.
The gods have all gone up Olympus' hill,
And all the songs are still
Of grieving Dryads, left
To wail about our woodland ways, bereft,
The endless summertide.
Queen Venus draws aside
And passes, sighing, up Olympus' hill.
And silence holds her Cyprian bowers, and claims
Her flowers, and quenches all her altar-flames,
And strikes dumb in their throats
Her doves' complaining notes:
      And sorrow
Sits crowned upon her seat: nor any morrow
Hears the Loves laughing round her golden chair.
(Alas, thy golden seat, thine empty seat!)
Nor any evening sees beneath her feet
The daisy rosier flush, the maidenhair
And scentless crocus borrow
From rose and hyacinth their savour sweet.
Without thee is no sweetness in the morn,
The morn that was fulfilled of mystery,
It lies like a void shell, desiring thee,
O daughter of the water and the dawn,
      Anadyomene!
There is no gold upon the bearded corn,
No blossom on the thorn;
And in wet brakes the Oreads hide, forlorn
Of every grace once theirs: no Faun will follow
  By herne or hollow
Their feet in the windy morn.

Let us all cry together "Cytherea!"
Lock hands and cry together: it may be
That she will heed and hear
And come from the waste places of the sea,
Leaving old Proteus all discomforted,
To cast down from his head
Its crown of nameless jewels, to be hurled
In ruins, with the ruined royalty
Of an old world.
The Nereids seek thee in the salt sea-reaches,
Seek thee; and seek, and seek, and never find:
Canst thou not hear their calling on the wind?
We nymphs go wandering under pines and beeches,
And far--and far behind
We hear Paris' piping blown
After us, calling thee and making moan
(For all the leaves that have no strength to cry,
The young leaves and the dry),
Desiring thee to bless these woods again,
Making most heavy moan
For withered myrtle-flowers,
For all thy Paphian bowers
Empty and sad beneath a setting sun;
  For dear days done!

The Naiads splash in the blue forest-pools--
  "Idalia--Idalia!" they cry.
"On Ida's hill,
With flutings faint and shrill,--
On Ida's hill the shepherds vainly try
Their songs, and coldly stand their damsels by,
Whatever tunes they try;
For beauty is not, and Love may not be,
  On land or sea--
Oh, not in earth or heaven, on land or sea,
While darkness holdeth thee."
The Naiads weep beside their forest-pools,
And from the oaks a hundred voices call,
"Come back to us, O thou desired of all!
Elsewhere the air is sultry: here it cools
And full it is of pine scents: here is still
The world-pain that has driven from Ida's hill
  Thine unreturning feet.

Alas! the days so fleet that were, and sweet,
When kind thou wert, and dear,
And all the loves dwelt here!
Alas! thy giftless hands, thy wandering feet!
Oh, here for Pithys' sake the air is sweet
And here snow falls not, neither burns the sun
Nor any winds make moan for dear days done.
Come, then: the woods are emptied all of glee,
And all the world is sad, desiring thee!"

    --Nora Hopper


HELEN OF TROY

I am that Helen, that very Helen
  Of Leda, born in the days of old:
Men's hearts as inns that I might dwell in:
  Houseless I wander to-night, and cold.

Because man loved me, no God takes pity:
  My ghost goes wailing where I was Queen!
Alas! my chamber in Troy's tall city,
  My golden couches, my hangings green!

Wasted with fire are the halls they built me,
  And sown with salt are the streets I trod,
Where flowers they scattered and spices spilt me--
  Alas, that Zeus is a jealous God!

Softly I went on my sandals golden;
  Of love and pleasure I took my fill;
With Paris' kisses my lips were holden,
  Nor guessed I, when life went at my will,
  That the fates behind me went softlier still.

    --Nora Hopper


AN ETRUSCAN RING

  Where, girt with orchard and with oliveyard,
The white hill-fortress glimmers on the hill,
Day after day an ancient goldsmith's skill
  Guided the copper graver, tempered hard
  By some lost secret, while he shaped the sard
Slowly to beauty, and his tiny drill,
Edged with corundum, ground its way until
  The gem lay perfect for the ring to guard.

Then seeing the stone complete to his desire,
With mystic imagery carven thus,
And dark Egyptian symbols fabulous,
He drew through it the delicate golden wire,
And bent the fastening; and the Etrurian sun
Sank behind Ilva, and the work was done.

  What dark-haired daughter of a Lucumo
Bore on her slim white finger to the grave
This the first gift her Tyrrhene lover gave,
  Those five-and-twenty centuries ago?
  What shadowy dreams might haunt it, lying low
So long, while kings and armies, wave on wave,
Above the rock-tomb's buried architrave
  Went trampling million-footed to and fro?

Who knows? but well it is so frail a thing,
Unharmed by conquering Time's supremacy,
Still should be fair, though scarce less old than Rome.
Now once again at rest from wandering
Across the high Alps and the dreadful sea,
In utmost England let it find a home.

    --J. W. Mackail


ORPHEUS WITH HIS LUTE

Orpheus with his lute made trees,
And the mountain tops that freeze,
  Bow themselves when he did sing:
To his music, plants and flowers
Ever sprung: as sun and showers
  There had made a lasting spring.

Everything that heard him play,
Even the billows of the sea,
  Hung their heads, and then lay by.
In sweet music is such art,
Killing care and grief of heart
  Fall asleep or hearing, die.

    --William Shakespeare


A HYMN IN PRAISE OF NEPTUNE

Of Neptune's empire let us sing
  At whose command the waves obey;
  To whom the rivers tribute pay,
Down the high mountains sliding:
  To whom the scaly nation yields
  Homage for the crystal fields
  Wherein they dwell:
And every sea-god pays a gem
  Yearly out of his wat'ry cell
To deck great Neptune's diadem.

The Tritons dancing in a ring
  Before his palace gates do make
  The waters with their echoes quake,
Like the great thunder sounding:
  The sea-nymphs chant their accents shrill,
  And the sirens, taught to kill
  With their sweet voice,
Make every echoing rock reply
  Unto their gentle murmuring noise
  The praise of Neptune's empery.

    --Thomas Campion


HORACE'S PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE

Book II, Ode 16

(In part, only)

He lives on little, and is blest,
  On whose plain board the bright
  Salt-cellar shines, which was his sire's delight,
Nor terrors, nor cupidity's unrest,
  Disturb his slumbers light.

Why should we still project and plan,
  We creatures of an hour?
  Why fly from clime to clime, new regions scour?
Where is the exile, who, since time began,
  To fly from self had power?

Fell care climbs brazen galley's sides;
  Nor troops of horse can fly
  Her foot, which than the stag's is swifter, ay,
Swifter than Eurus when he madly rides
  The clouds along the sky.

Careless what lies beyond to know,
  And turning to the best,
  The present, meet life's bitters with a jest,
And smile them down; since nothing here below
  Is altogether blest.

In manhood's prime Achilles died,
  Tithonus by the slow
  Decay of age was wasted to a show,
And Time may what it hath to thee denied
  On me perchance bestow.

To me a farm of modest size,
  And slender vein of song,
  Such as in Greece flowed vigorous and strong,
Kind fate hath given, and spirit to despise
 The base, malignant throng.

    --Sir Theodore Martin


AN INVITATION TO DINE WRITTEN BY HORACE TO VIRGIL

Book IV, Ode 12

Yes, a small box of nard from the stores of Sulpicius[2]
  A cask shall elicit, of potency rare
To endow with fresh hopes, dewy-bright and delicious,
  And wash from our hearts every cobweb of care.

If you'd dip in such joys, come--the better the quicker!--
  But remember the fee--for it suits not my ends,
To let you make havoc, scot-free, 'with my liquor,
  As though I were one of your heavy-pursed friends.

To the winds with base lucre and pale melancholy!--
  In the flames of the pyre these, alas! will be vain,
Mix your sage ruminations with glimpses of folly,--
  'Tis delightful at times to be somewhat insane.

    --Sir Theodore Martin

    [Footnote 2: Virgil must bring some rare perfume in exchange
    for the rich wine, since Horace thus playfully conditions his
    invitation.]


THE GOLDEN MEAN

Horace. Book II, Ode 10

Receive, dear friends, the truths I teach,
So shalt thou live beyond the reach
  Of adverse Fortune's power;
Not always tempt the distant deep,
Nor always timorously creep
  Along the treacherous shore.

He that holds fast the golden mean
And lives contentedly between
  The little and the great,
Feels not the wants that pinch the poor,
Nor plagues that haunt the rich man's door,
  Imbittering all his state.

The tallest pines feel most the power
Of wintry blasts; the loftiest tower
  Comes heaviest to the ground;
The bolts that spare the mountain's side
His cloud-capt eminence divide,
  And spread the ruin round.

The well-informed philosopher
Rejoices with a wholesome fear,
  And hopes in spite of pain;
If winter bellow from the north,
Soon the sweet spring comes dancing forth,
  And nature laughs again.

What if thine heaven be overcast?
The dark appearance will not last;
  Expect a brighter sky.
The god that strings a silver bow
Awakes sometimes the Muses too,
  And lays his arrows by.

If hindrances obstruct thy way,
Thy magnanimity display,
  And let thy strength be seen:
But O! if Fortune fill thy sail
With more than a propitious gale,
  Take half thy canvas in.

    --William Cowper


TO THE READER

Martial

He unto whom thou art so partial,
O reader, is the well-known Martial,
The Epigrammatist: while living,
Give him the fame thou wouldst be giving
So shall he hear, and feel, and know it:
Post-obits rarely reach a poet.

    --Lord Byron


ON PORTIA

Martial. Book I, xlii

When the sad tale, how Brutus fell, was brought,
And slaves refused the weapon Portia sought;
"Know ye not yet," she said, with towering pride,
"Death is a boon that cannot be denied?
I thought my father amply had imprest
This simple truth upon each Roman breast."
Dauntless she gulph'd the embers as they flamed
And, while their heat within her raged, exclaim'd
"Now, troublous guardians of a life abhorr'd,
Still urge your caution, and refuse the sword."

    --George Lamb


TO POTITUS

Martial. Book X, lxx

That scarce a piece I publish in a year,
Idle perhaps to you I may appear.
But rather, that I write at all, admire,
When I am often robbed of days entire.
Now with my friends the evening I must spend:
To those preferred my compliments must send.
Now at the witnessing a will make one:
Hurried from this to that, my morning's gone.
Some office must attend; or else some ball;
Or else my lawyer's summons to the hall.
Now a rehearsal, now a concert hear;
And now a Latin play at Westminster.
Home after ten return, quite tir'd and dos'd.
When is the piece, you want, to be compos'd?

    --John Hay


WHAT IS GIVEN TO FRIENDS IS NOT LOST

Martial

Your slave will with your gold abscond,
  The fire your home lay low,
Your debtor will disown his bond
  Your farm no crops bestow;
Your steward a mistress frail shall cheat;
Your freighted ship the storms will beat;
That only from mischance you'll save,
  Which to your friends is given;
The only wealth you'll always have
  Is that you've lent to heaven.

    --_English Journal of Education_,
        _Jan., 1856_


TO COTILUS

Martial

They tell me, Cotilus, that you're a beau:
What this is, Cotilus, I wish to know.
"A beau is one who, with the nicest care,
In parted locks divides his curling hair;
One who with balm and cinnamon smells sweet,
Whose humming lips some Spanish air repeat;
Whose naked arms are smoothed with pumice-stone,
And tossed about with graces all his own:
A beau is one who takes his constant seat
From morn till evening, where the ladies meet;
And ever, on some sofa hovering near,
Whispers some nothing in some fair one's ear;
Who scribbles thousand billets-doux a day;
Still reads and scribbles, reads, and sends away;
A beau is one who shrinks, if nearly pressed
By the coarse garment of a neighbor guest;
Who knows who flirts with whom, and still is found
At each good table in successive round:
A beau is one--none better knows than he
A race-horse, and his noble pedigree"--
Indeed? Why Cotilus, if this be so,
What teasing trifling thing is called a beau!

    --Elton


THE HAPPY LIFE

Martial

_To Julius Martialis_

The things that make a life to please,
(Sweetest Martial), they are these:
Estate inherited, not got:
A thankful field, hearth always hot:
City seldom, law-suits never:
Equal friends, agreeing forever:
Health of body, peace of mind:
Sleeps that till the morning bind:
Wise simplicity, plain fare:
Not drunken nights, yet loos'd from care:
A sober, not a sullen spouse:
Clean strength, not such as his that plows;
Wish only what thou art, to be;
Death neither wish, nor fear to see.

    --Sir Richard Fanshawe


TO A SCHOOLMASTER

Martial. Book X, lxii

Thou monarch of eight parts of speech,
Who sweep'st with birch a youngster's breech,
Oh! now awhile withhold your hand!
So may the trembling crop-hair'd band
Around your desk attentive hear,
And pay you love instead of fear;
So may yours ever be as full,
As writing or as dancing school.
The scorching dog-day is begun;
The harvest roasting in the sun;
Each Bridewell keeper, though requir'd
To use the lash, is too much tir'd.
Let ferula and rod together
Lie dormant, till the frosty weather.
Boys do improve enough in reason,
Who miss a fever in this season.

    --John Hay


EPITAPH ON EROTION

Martial. Book X, lxi

Underneath this greedy stone,
Lies little sweet Erotion;[3]
Whom the Fates, with hearts as cold,
Nipp'd away at six years old.
Thou, whoever thou mayst be,
That hast this small field after me,
Let the yearly rites be paid
To her little slender shade;
So shall no disease or jar
Hurt thy house, or chill thy Lar;
But this tomb be here alone
The only melancholy stone.

    --Leigh Hunt

    [Footnote 3: A little girl who died at six years of age.]


_NON AMO TE_

Martial. I, 32

Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare:
Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te.[4]

    [Footnote 4: This well known epigram is the original of one
    equally famous in English, that written by Tom Brown on Dr. John
    Fell, about 1670.

      "I do not like thee, Dr. Fell.
      The reason why I cannot tell;
      But this I know and know full well
      I do not like thee, Dr. Fell." ]


GRATITUDE

Some hae meat and canna eat,
And some wad eat that want it;
But we hae meat and we can eat
And sae the Lord be thanket.

    --Burns

Translation

Sunt quibus est panis
  nec amor tamen ullus edendi:
Sunt quibus hic amor est

  gratia habenda Deo.

    --_The Lawrence Latinist_


A HYMN TO THE LARES

It was, and still my care is,
To worship ye, the Lares,
With crowns of greenest parsley,
And garlick chives not scarcely;
For favors here to warme me,
And not by fire to harme me;
For gladding so my hearth here,
With inoffensive mirth here;
That while the wassaile bowle here
With North-down ale doth troule here,
No sillable doth fall here,
To marre the mirth at all here.
For which, O chimney-keepers!
(I dare not call ye sweepers)
So long as I am able
To keep a country-table
Great be my fare, or small cheere,
I'll eat and drink up all here.

    --Robert Herrick


ELYSIUM

Past the despairing wail--
And the bright banquets of the Elysian Vale
Melt every care away!
Delight, that breathes and moves forever,
Glides through sweet fields like some sweet river!
Elysian life survey!
There, fresh with youth, o'er jocund meads,
His merry west-winds blithely leads
The ever-blooming May!
Through gold-woven dreams goes the dance of the Hours,
In space without bounds swell the soul and its powers,
And Truth, with no veil, gives her face to the day.
And joy today and joy tomorrow
But wafts the airy soul aloft;
The very name is lost to Sorrow,
And Pain is Rapture tuned more exquisitely soft.
Here the Pilgrim reposes the world-weary limb,
And forgets in the shadow, cool-breathing and dim,
The load he shall bear never more;
Here the mower, his sickle at rest, by the streams
Lull'd with harp strings, reviews, in the calm of his dreams
The fields, when the harvest is o'er.
Here, He, whose ears drank in the battle roar,
Whose banners streamed upon the startled wind
A thunder-storm,--before whose thunder tread
The mountains trembled,--in soft sleep reclined,
By the sweet brook that o'er its pebbly bed
In silver plays, and murmurs to the shore,
Hears the stern clangour of wild spears no more.

    --Schiller


ORPHEUS

Orpheus he went (as poets tell)
To fetch Euridice from hell;
And had her; but it was upon
This short, but strict, condition:
Backward he should not looke while he
Led her through hell's obscuritie.
But ah! it happened as he made
His passage through that dreadful shade,
Revolve he did his loving eye,
For gentle feare, or jelousie,
And looking back, that look did sever
Him and Euridice forever.

    --Robert Herrick


CERBERUS

Dear Reader, should you chance to go
To Hades, do not fail to throw
A "Sop to Cerberus" at the gate,
His anger to propitiate.
Don't say "Good dog!" and hope thereby
His three fierce Heads to pacify.
What though he try to be polite
And wag his tail with all his might,
How shall one amiable Tail
Against three angry Heads prevail?
The Heads _must_ win.--What puzzles me
Is why in Hades there should be
A watchdog; 'tis, I should surmise,
The _last_ place one would burglarize.

    --Oliver Herford


THE HARPY

They certainly contrived to raise
Queer ladies in the olden days.
Either the type had not been fixed,
Or else Zooelogy got mixed.
I envy not primeval man
This female on the feathered plan.
We only have, I'm glad to say,
Two kinds of human birds today--
Women and warriors, who still
Wear feathers when dressed up to kill.

    --Oliver Herford


CUPID AND THE BEE

Anacreon[5]

Young Cupid once a rose caressed,
And sportively its leaflets pressed.
The witching thing, so fair to view
One could not but believe it true,
Warmed, on its bosom false, a bee,
Which stung the boy-god in his glee.
Sobbing, he raised his pinions bright,
And flew unto the isle of light,
Where, in her beauty, myrtle-crowned,
The Paphian goddess sat enthroned.
Her Cupid sought, and to her breast
His wounded finger, weeping, pressed.
"O mother! kiss me," was his cry--
"O mother! save me, or I die;
A winged little snake or bee
With cruel sting has wounded me!"
The blooming goddess in her arms
Folded and kissed his budding charms;
To her soft bosom pressed her pride,
And then with truthful words replied:
"If thus a little insect thing
Can pain thee with its tiny sting,
How languish, think you, those who smart
Beneath my Cupid's cruel dart?
How fatal must that poison prove
That rankles on the shafts of Love."

    sixth century B.C.]


THE ASSEMBLY OF THE GODS

O'er rolling stars, from heavenly stalls advancing,
  The coaches soon were seen, and a long train
Of mules with litters, horses fleet and prancing,
  Their trappings all embroidery, nothing plain;
And with fine liveries, in the sunbeams glancing,
  More than a hundred servants, rather vain
Of handsome looks and of their stature tall,
Followed their masters to the Council Hall.

First came the Prince of Delos, Phoebus hight,
  In a gay travelling carriage, fleetly drawn
By six smart Spanish chestnuts, shining bright,
  Which with their tramping shook the aerial lawn;
Red was his cloak, three-cocked his hat, and light
  Around his neck the golden fleece was thrown;
And twenty-four sweet damsels, nectar-sippers,
Were running near him in their pumps or slippers.

Pallas, with lovely but disdainful mien,
  Came on a nag of Basignanian race;
Tight round her leg, and gathered up, was seen
  Her gown, half Greek, half Spanish; o'er her face
Part of her hair hung loose, a natural screen,
  Part was tied up, and with becoming grace;
A bunch of feathers on her head she wore,
And on her saddle-bow her falchion bore.

But Ceres and the God of Wine appeared
  At once, conversing; and the God of Ocean
Upon a dolphin's back his form upreared,
  Floating through waves of air with graceful motion;
Naked, all sea-weed, and with mud besmeared;
  For whom his mother Rhea feels emotion,
Reproaching his proud brother, when she meets him,
Because so like a fisherman he treats him.

Diana, the sweet virgin, was not there;
  She had risen early and o'er woodland green
Had gone to wash her clothes in fountain fair
  Upon the Tuscan shore--romantic scene.
And not returning till the northern star
  Had rolled through dusky air and lost its sheen,
Her mother made excuses quite provoking,
Knitting at the time, a worsted stocking.

Juno-Lucina did not go--and why?
  She anxious wished to wash her sacred head.
Menippus, Jove's chief taster, standing by
  For the disastrous Fates excuses made.
They had much tow to spin, and lint to dry,
  And they were also busy baking bread.
The cellarman, Silenus, kept away,
To water the domestics' wine, that day.

On starry benches sit the famous warriors
  Of the immortal kingdom, in a ring;
Now drums and cymbals, echoing to the barriers,
  Announce the coming of the gorgeous king;
A hundred pages, valets, napkin-carriers
  Attend, and their peculiar offerings bring.
And after them, armed with his club so hard,
Alcides, captain of the city guard.

With Jove's broad hat and spectacles arrived
  The light-heeled Mercury; in his hand he bore
A sack, in which, of other means deprived,
  He damned poor mortals' prayers, some million score;
Those he disposed in vessels, well contrived,
  Which graced his father's cabinet of yore;
And, wont attention to all claims to pay,
He regularly signed them twice a day.

Then Jove himself, in royal habit dressed,
  With starry diadem upon his head,
And o'er his shoulders an imperial vest
  Worn upon holidays.--The king displayed
A sceptre, pastoral shape, with hooked crest:
  In a rich jacket too was he arrayed,
Given by the inhabitants of Sericane,
And Ganymede held up his splendid train.

A MODEL YOUNG LADY OF ANTIQUITY

  (Pliny, the Younger, writes the following in a letter relative to
  the death of Minicia Marcella, the daughter of his friend, Fundanus.)

Tristissimus haec tibi scribo, Fundani nostri filia minore defuncta,
qua puella nihil umquam festivius, amabilius, nec modo longiore vita
sed prope immortalitate dignius vidi. Nondum annos quattuor decem
impleverat, et iam illi anilis prudentia, matronalis gravitas erat, et
tamen suavitas puellaris cum virginali verecundia. Ut illa patris
cervicibus inhaerebat! Ut nos amicos paternos et amanter et modeste
complectabatur! ut nutrices, ut paedagogos, ut praeceptores, pro suo
quemque officio diligebat! quam studiose, quam intellegenter lectitabat!
ut parce custoditeque ludebat! Qua illa temperantia, qua patientia, qua
etiam constantia novissimam valetudinem tulit! Medicis obsequebatur,
sororem, patrem adhortabatur, ipsamque se destitutam corporis viribus
vigore animi sustinebat. Duravit hic illi usque ad extremum nec aut
spatio valetudinis aut metu mortis infractus est, quo plures
gravioresque nobis causas relinqueret et desiderii et doloris. O triste
plane acerbumque funus! O morte ipsa mortis tempus indignius! Iam
destinata erat egregio iuveni, iam electus nuptiarum dies, iam nos
vocati. Quod gaudium quo maerore mutatum est! Nec possum exprimere
verbis quantum anima vulnus acceperim, cum audivi Fundanum ipsum,
praecipientem, quod in vestes margarita gemmas fuerat erogaturus, hoc
in tus et unguenta et odores impenderetur.

  --C. Pliny. _Epist._ v, 16

Translation

I have the saddest news to tell you. Our friend Fundanus has lost his
youngest daughter. I never saw a girl more cheerful, more lovable, more
worthy of long life--nay, of immortality. She had not yet completed her
fourteenth year, and she had already the prudence of an old woman, the
gravity of a matron, and still, with all maidenly modesty, the sweetness
of a girl. How she would cling to her father's neck! how affectionately
and discreetly she would greet us, her father's friends! how she loved
her nurses, her attendants, her teachers,--everyone according to his
service. How earnestly, how intelligently, she used to read! How modest
was she and restrained in her sports! And with what self-restraint, what
patience--nay, what courage--she bore her last illness! She obeyed the
physicians, encouraged her father and sister, and, when all strength of
body had left her, kept herself alive by the vigor of her mind. This
vigor lasted to the very end, and was not broken by the length of her
illness or by the fear of death; so leaving, alas! to us yet more and
weightier reasons for our grief and our regret. Oh the sadness, the
bitterness of that death! Oh the cruelty of the time when we lost her,
worse even than the loss itself! She had been betrothed to a noble
youth; the marriage day had been fixed, and we had been invited. How
great a joy changed into how great a sorrow! I cannot express in words
how it went to my heart when I heard Fundanus himself (this is one of
the grievous experiences of sorrow) giving orders that what he had meant
to lay out on dresses, and pearls, and jewels, should be spent on
incense, unguents, and spices.

TO LESBIA'S SPARROW

Lugete, o Veneres Cupidinesque,
Et quantumst hominum venustiorum.
Passer mortuus est meae puellae,
Passer, deliciae meae puellae,
Quem plus illa oculis suis amabat:
Nam mellitus erat suamque norat
Ipsa tam bene quam puella matrem,
Nec sese a gremio illius movebat,
Sed circumsiliens modo huc modo illuc
Ad solam dominam usque pipiabat.
Qui nunc it per iter tenebricosum
Illuc unde negant redire quemquam.
At vobis male sit, malae tenebrae
Orci, quae omnia bella devoratis:
Tam bellum mihi passerem abstulistis.
O factum male! io miselle passer!
Tua nunc opera meae puellae
Flendo turgiduli rubent ocelli.

    --Catullus


Translation

Each Love, each Venus, mourn with me!
Mourn, every son of gallantry!
The sparrow, my own nymph's delight,
The joy and apple of her sight;
The honey-bird, the darling dies,
To Lesbia dearer than her eyes,
As the fair one knew her mother,
So he knew her from another.
With his gentle lady wrestling,
In her snowy bosom nestling;
With a flutter and a bound,
Quiv'ring round her and around;
Chirping, twitt'ring, ever near,
Notes meant only for her ear.
Now he skims the shadowy way,
Whence none return to cheerful day.
Beshrew the shades! that thus devour
All that's pretty in an hour.
The pretty sparrow thus is dead;
The tiny fugitive is fled.
Deed of spite! poor bird!--ah! see,
For thy dear sake, alas! for me!--
My nymph with brimful eyes appears,
Red from the flushing of her tears.

CICERO

  The following tribute to Cicero was written by Catullus, the Roman
  lyric poet (87-54 B.C.)

Disertissime Romuli nepotum,
Quot sunt quotque fuere, Marce Tulli,
Quot que post aliis erunt in annis,
Gratius tibi maximas Catullus
Agit, pessimus omnium poeta,
Tanto pessimus omnium poeta
Quanto tu optimus omnium patronum.

Translation

Tully, most eloquent, most sage
  Of all the Roman race,
That deck the past or present age,
  Or future days may grace.

Oh! may Catullus thus declare
  An overflowing heart;
And, though the worst of poets, dare
  A grateful lay impart!

'Twill teach thee how thou hast surpast
  All others in thy line;
For, far as he in his is last,
  Art thou the first in thine.

Sanctis quoque similior,
Hostibus suis fortior,
Amicis amabilior.

THE FAVORITE PRAYER OF MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS[6]

O Domine Deus!
Speravi in te;
O care mi Iesu!
Nunc libera me:
In dura catena
In misera poena
Desidero te;
Languendo, gemendo,
Et genuflectendo
Adoro, imploro,
Ut liberes me!

Translation

My Lord and my God! I have trusted in Thee;
O Jesus, my Savior belov'd, set me free:
In rigorous chains, in piteous pains,
I am longing for Thee!
In weakness appealing, in agony kneeling,
I pray, I beseech Thee, O Lord, set me free!

    be her composition. Said to have been uttered by the queen just

_ULTIMA THULE_

  American pride has often gloried in Seneca's "Vision of the West"
  written more than 1800 years ago.

    Venient annis
Saecula seris, quibus Oceanus
Vincula rerum laxet, et ingens
Pateat tellus, Tethysque novos
Detegat orbes, nec sit terris
Ultima Thule.

    --Seneca

Translation

A time will come in future ages far
When Ocean will his circling bounds unbar,
And, opening vaster to the Pilot's hand,
New worlds shall rise, where mightier kingdoms are,
Nor Thule longer be the utmost land.


THE ROMAN OF OLD

Oh, the Roman was a rogue,
  He erat, was, you bettum;
He ran his automobilis
  And smoked his cigarettum;
He wore a diamond studibus
  And elegant cravatum,
A maxima cum laude shirt
  And such a stylish hattum.

He loved the luscious hic-haec-hoc,
  And bet on games and equi:
At times he won: at others, though,
  He got it in the nequi.
He winked (quousque tandem?)
  At puellas on the Forum,
And sometimes even made
  Those goo-goo oculorum!

He frequently was seen
  At combats gladiatorial,
And ate enough to feed
  Ten boarders at Memorial:
He often went on sprees,
  And said on starting homus,
"Hic labor, opus est,
  Oh, where's my hic-haec-domus?"

Although he lived in Rome--
  Of all the arts the middle--
He was (excuse the phrase)
  A horrid individ'l;
Ah, what a different thing
  Was the homo (dative homini)
Of far away B.C.
  From us of Anno Domini!

_ICH BIN DEIN_

  The _Journal of Education_ commends this ingenious poem, written
  in seven languages--English, French, German, Greek, Latin, Spanish,
  and Italian--as one of the best specimens of Macaronic verse in
  existence, and worthy of preservation by all collectors.

_In tempus_ old a hero lived,
  _Qui_ loved _puellas deux_;
He no _pouvait pas_ quite to say
  Which one _amabat mieux_.
_Dit-il lui-meme un beau matin_,
  "_Non possum_ both _avoir_,
_Sed si_ address Amanda Ann,
  Then Kate _y yo_ have war.
Amanda _habet argent_ coin,
  _Sed_ Kate has _aureas_ curls;
_Et_ both _sunt_ very _agathae_
  _Et_ quite _formosae_ girls."
_Enfin_ the _joven anthropos_,
  _Philoun_ the _duo_ maids,
Resolved _proponere ad_ Kate
  _Devant cet_ evening's shades,
_Procedens_ then to Kate's _domo_,
  _Il trouve_ Amanda there,
_Kai_ quite forgot his late resolves,
  Both _sunt_ so goodly fair,
_Sed_ smiling on the new _tapis_,
  Between _puellas_ twain,
_Coepit_ to tell _suo_ love _a_ Kate
  _Dans un poetique_ strain.
_Mais_, glancing ever _et_ anon
  At fair Amanda's eyes,
_Illae non possunt dicere_
  _Pro_ which he meant his sighs.
Each _virgo_ heard the demi-vow,
  _Con_ cheeks as _rouge_ as wine,
_Ed_ offering, each, a milk-white hand,
  Both whispered, "_Ich bin dein._"


_MALUM OPUS_

Prope ripam fluvii solus
  A senex silently sat;
Super capitum ecce his wig,
  Et wig super, ecce his hat.

Blew Zephyrus alte, acerbus,
  Dum elderly gentleman sat;
Et a capite took up quite torve
  Et in rivum projecit his hat.

Tunc soft maledixit the old man,
  Tunc stooped from the bank where he sat,
Et cum scipio poked in the water,
  Conatus servare his hat.

Blew Zephyrus alte, acerbus,
  The moment it saw him at that;
Et whisked his novum scratch wig
  In flumen, along with his hat.

Ab imo pectore damnavit,
  In coeruleus eye dolor sat;
Tunc despairingly threw in his cane,
  Nare cum his wig and his hat.

_L'Envoi_

Contra bonos mores, don't swear
  It est wicked you know (verbum sat)
Si this tale habet no other moral
  Mehercle! You're gratus to that.

_FELIS_

A cat sedebat on our fence
  As laeta as could be;
Her vox surgebat to the skies,
  Canebat merrily.

My clamor was of no avail,
  Tho' clare did I cry.
Conspexit me with mild reproof,
  And winked her alter eye.

Quite vainly ieci boots, a lamp,
  Some bottles and a book;
Ergo, I seized my pistol, et
  My aim cum cura took.

I had six shots, dixi, "Ye gods,
  May I that felis kill!"
Quamquam I took six of her lives
  The other three sang still.

The felis sang with major vim,
  Though man's aim was true,
Conatus sum, putare quid
  In tonitru I'd do.

A scheme advenit in my head
  Scivi, 'twould make her wince--
I sang! Et then the hostis fled
  Non eam vidi since.

_AMANTIS RES ADVERSAE_

A homo ibat, one dark night
  Puellas visitare
Et mansit there so very late
  Ut illi constet cura.

Pueri walking by the house
  Saw caput in fenestra,
Et sunt morati for a while
  To see quis erat in there.

Soon caput turned its nasum round
  In viam puerorum;
Agnoscunt there the pedagogue,
  Oh! maximum pudorem!

Progressus puer to the door
  Cum magna quietate,
Et turned the key to lock him in
  Moratus satis ante.

Tum pedagogue arose to go
  Est feeling hunky-dore:
Sed non potest to get out
  Nam key's outside the fore.

Ascendit sweetheart now the stairs
  Cum festinato pede,
Et roused puellas from their sleep
  Sed habent non the door key.

Tum excitavit dominum
  By her tumultuous voce
Insanus currit to the door
  Et vidit puellam.

"Furenti place," the master roared,
  "Why spoil you thus my somnum?
Exite from the other door
  Si rogues have locked the front one."

Puella tristis hung her head
  And took her lover's manum,
Et cite from the other door
  His caput est impulsum.

Cum magno gradu redit domum
  Retrorsum umquam peeping,
Et never ausus est again
  Vexare people's sleeping.

Flevit lepus parvulus
clamans altis vocibus:

Quid feci hominibus,

Neque in horto fui,

Leves pedes habeo,
magnum saltum facio.

Ne narrate verbis maestis,

Vita vera! vita gravis!
Meta non est obitus;

Ned laetitia, nec maeror,
Finis designatus est;
Sed augere, est noster labor,
Semper rem quae nobis est.

Ars est longa, tempus fugit,
Ut cor tuum valens sit,
Tamen modum tristem tundit
Neniae qui concinit.

Orbis terrae campo in lato,
In aetatis proeliis,
Mutum pecus turpe ne esto!
Heros esto in copiis!

Fidere futuro noli!
Anni numquam redeunt.
Age nunc! age in praesenti!
Fortes dei diligunt.

Summi nos admonent omnes
Simus inter nobilis,
Et legemus, disce dentes,
Signa viae posteris;

Signa forsitan futura
Alicui felicia,
Qui, tum in dura vitae via,
Cernat haec cum gratia.

Agite, tum nos nitamur
Quidquid erit, fortiter,
Superantes iam sequamur
Patienter, acriter.

Vivant et mulieres,
Dulces et amabiles,
  Bonae, laboriosae.

Vivat et res publica,

Vivat nostra civitas,
Maecenatum caritas,
  Quae nos hic protegit.

Pereat diabolus,

  Atque irrisores.

Translation

While the glowing hours are bright,
  Let not sadness mar them,
For when age shall rifle youth,
And shall drive our joys unsooth,
  Then the grave will bar them.

Where are those who from the world
  Long ago departed!
Scale Olympus' lofty height--
See grim Hades' murky night--
  There are the great hearted.

Mortal life is but a span,
  That is quickly fleeting;
Cruel death comes on apace
And removes us from the race,
  None with favor treating.

Long may this fair temple stand,
  Nassau now and ever!
Long may her professors grace
Each his own time honored place,
  Friendship failing never.

May our charming maidens live,
  Matchless all in beauty,
May our blooming matrons long
Be the theme of grateful song,
  Patterns bright of duty.

May our Union grow in strength,
  Faithful rulers guiding;
In the blaze of Freedom's light
Where the genial arts are bright,
  Find we rest abiding.

Out on sighing! Vanish hate,
  And ye friends of sadness;
To his chill abode of woe,
Let the dread Philistine go,
  Who would steal our gladness.

Integer vitae, scelerisque purus

Sive per Syrtes, iter aestuosas,
Sive facturus per inhospitalem
Caucasum, vel quae loca fabulosus
  Lambit Hydaspes.

Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis
Arbor aestiva recreatur aura;
Quod latus mundi nebulae malusque
  Iuppiter urget;

Pone sub curru nimium propinqui
Solis, in terra domibus negata:
Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo,
  Dulce loquentem.

Translation

Fuscus, the man of life upright and pure
Needeth nor javelin, nor bow of Moor
Nor arrows tipped with venom deadly-sure,
  Loading his quiver.

Whether o'er Afric's burning sand he rides,
Or frosty Caucasus' bleak mountain-sides,
Or wanders lonely, where Hydaspes glides,
  That storied river.

Place me where no life-laden summer breeze
Freshens the meads, or murmurs 'mongst the trees;
Where clouds oppress, and withering tempests' breeze
  From shore to shore.

Place me beneath the sunbeams' fiercest glare,
On arid sands, no dwelling anywhere,
Still Lalage's sweet smile, sweet voice _e'en there_
  I will adore.

Salva me, Salvator unus!

Nil in manu mecum fero
Sed me versus crucem gero;
Vestimenta nudus oro,
Opem debilis imploro;
Fontem Christi quaero immundus,
Nisi laves, moribundus.

Dum hos artus vita regit;
Quando nox sepulchre tegit;
Mortuos cum stare iubes;
Sedens iudex inter nubes;
Iesu, pro me perforatus,
Condar intra tuum latus.

    --Toplady. Tr. by Gladstone


_DIES IRAE_[7]

Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla,
Teste David cum Sybilla.

Quantus tremor est futurus,
Quando iudex est venturus,
Cuncta stricte discussurus!

Tuba, mirum spargens sonum
Per sepulcra regionum,
Coget omnes ante thronum.

Mors stupebit, et natura,
Cum resurget creatura
Iudicanti responsura.

Liber scriptus proferetur,
Inquo totum continetur,
Unde mundus iudicetur.

Iudex ergo cum sedebit,
Quidquid latet, apparebit,
Nil inultum remanebit.

Quid sum miser tunc dicturus,
Quem patronum rogaturus,
Cum vix iustus sit securus?

Rex tremendae maiestatis,
Qui salvandos salvas gratis,
Salva me, fons pietatis!

Recordare, Iesu pie,
Quod sum causa tuae viae;
Ne me perdas illa die!

Quaerens me sedisti lassus,
Redemisti crucem passus:
Tantus labor non sit cassus!

Iuste iudex ultionis,
Donum fac remissionis
Ante diem rationis!

    --Thomas of Celano

    [Footnote 7: "This marvelous hymn is the acknowledged masterpiece
    of Latin poetry and the most sublime of all uninspired hymns."

Translation

Day of Wrath,--that Day of Days,--
When earth shall vanish in a blaze,
As David, with the Sibyl, says!

What a trembling will come o'er us,
When the Judge shall be before us,
For every hidden sin to score us!

The trumpet with its wondrous sound,
Piercing each sepulchral mound,
Shall summon all, the throne around.

Nature and death will stand aghast,
When those who to the grave have past,
Come answering to the judgment blast!

The Written Book shall be unrolled,
Wherein the deeds of all are told,
And shall the doom of all unfold.

For when the Judge shall be enthroned,
No secret shall be left unowned,
No crime or trespass unatoned.

When for a guilty wretch like me,
What plea, what pleader, will there be,
When scarcely shall the just go free!

King of tremendous majesty,
Whose grace saves all who saved may be,
Fountain of mercy, oh save me!

Forget not then, dear Son of God,
For my sake Thou thy way hast trod,
Nor let me sink beneath thy rod.

Yes, me to save Thou sat'st in pain,
Nor didst the bitter Cross disdain,--
Let not such anguish be in vain!

Unerring Judge, thy wrath restrain,
And let my sins remission gain,
While still the days of grace remain.

    --Tr. Robert C. Winthrop


_AD SANCTUM SPIRITUS_[8]

Veni, Sancte Spiritus,
Et emitte coelitus
Lucis tuae radium.
Veni, pater pauperum,
Veni, dator munerum,
Veni, lumen cordium;

O lux beatissima,
Reple cordis intima
Tuorum fidelium!
Sine tuo numine
Nihil est in homine,
Nihil est innoxium.

Da tuis fidelibus
In te confitentibus
Sacrum septenarium;
Da virtutis meritum,
Da salutis exitum,
Da perenne gaudium!

    [Footnote 8: Ascribed to Innocent III, Robert II, of France, and
    others. Ranks second to _Dies Irae_ among the Great Hymns. Can be
    sung to the tune of Rock of Ages.]

Translation

Holy Spirit, come, we pray
Shed from Heaven thine inward ray,
Kindle darkness into day.
Come, Thou Father of the poor,
Come, Thou source of all our store,
Light of hearts forevermore.

Light most blissful! Fire divine!
Fill, oh! fill these hearts of Thine!
On our inmost being shine.
If in Thee it be not wrought
All in men is simply naught,
Nothing pure in deed and thought.

On the faithful who confide,
Solely in Thyself as guide,
Let Thy sevenfold gifts abide.
Grant them virtue's full increase,
Grant them safe and sweet release,
Grant them everlasting peace!


_ADESTE, FIDELES_

_A Christmas Hymn_

Adeste, fideles,
Laeti, triumphantes,
Venite, venite in Bethlehem:
Natum videte
Regem Angelorum:

_Chorus_

Venite adoremus,
Venite adoremus,
Venite adoremus Dominum.

Deum de Deo,
Lumen de lumine,
Gestant puellae viscera:
Deum verum,
Genitum non factum:

Cantet nunc Io
Chorus Angelorum,
Cantet nunc aula caelestium:
Gloria in
Excelsis Deo:

Ergo qui natus
Die hodierna
Iesu, tibi sit gloria:
Patris aeterni
Verbum caro factum.

Translation

O come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold him.
Born, the King of Angels;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.

God of God,
Light of Light,
Lo! He abhors not the Virgin's womb;
Very God,
Begotten, not created;
O come, let us adore Him, etc.

Sing choirs of Angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of Heav'n above:
"Glory to God
In the highest";
O come, let us adore Him, etc.

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning;
Jesu, to Thee be glory given;
Word of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing;
O come, let us adore Him, etc.


_DE NATIVITATE DOMINI_[9]

Puer natus in Bethlehem
Unde gaudet Ierusalem

Hic iacet in praesepio,
Qui regnat sine termino.

Cognovit bos et asinus
Quod puer erat Dominus.

Reges de Saba veniunt,
Aurum, thus, myrrham offerunt.

Intrantes domum invicem
Novum salutant Principem.

De matre natus virgine
Sine virile semine;

Sine serpentis vulnere
De nostro venit sanguine;

In carne nobis similis,
Peccato sed dissimilis;

Ut redderet nos homines
Deo et sibi similes

In hoc natali gaudio
Benedicamus Domino.

Laudetur sancta Trinitas;
Deo dicamus gratias.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
