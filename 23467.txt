THIS IS FAIRY'S ALBUM.

    This is Fairy, bright as Spring,
    Loving every living thing
    With a love so sweet and true,
    That all creatures love her too!
    This is Fairy, bright as Spring,
          IN FAIRY'S ALBUM.

[Illustration]

    This is Fairy, wondrous wise,
    Sunshine laughing in her eyes,
    Who will prattle on for hours
    To the brooks and trees and flowers,
    To the birds and butterflies,
    To all creatures 'neath the skies,
    Understanding all they say
    In a curious sort of way!
    This is Fairy, wondrous wise,
          IN FAIRY'S ALBUM.

[Illustration]

    This is Fairy Fanciful,
    Never moping, never dull,
    For her mind is amply stored
    With an overflowing hoard
    Of the tales of fairy times,
    And of quaint old nursery rhymes,
    So that she can always find
    Good companions when inclined!
    This is Fairy Fanciful,
          IN FAIRY'S ALBUM.




THE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.


        This is a rhyme
        Of ancient time
    Of a certain old woman who lived in a shoe,
    And had so many children she didn't know what to do:
    Fairy knows her, and says it's true.

[Illustration]

    This is the shoe.
    And this is the dame
    Without a name,
      WHO LIVED IN THE SHOE.

[Illustration]

    These are the children, quite a score--
    Perhaps one less, perhaps one more--
    Who worried the dame without a name,
      WHO LIVED IN THE SHOE.

[Illustration]

    This is the broth so weak and thin,
    With never a bit of bread therein,
    Made for the children, quite a score--
    Perhaps one less, perhaps one more--
    Who worried the dame without a name,
      WHO LIVED IN THE SHOE.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    This is the stick so long and thick,
    That followed the broth so weak and thin,
    With never a bit of bread therein,
    Made for the children, quite a score--
    Perhaps one less, perhaps one more--
    Who worried the dame without a name,
      WHO LIVED IN THE SHOE.

    This is the bed within the shoe,
    That the children got in, two by two,
    Urged by the stick so long and thick,
    That followed the broth so weak and thin,
    With never a bit of bread therein,
    Made for the children, quite a score--

[Illustration]

    Perhaps one less, perhaps one more--
    Who worried the dame without a name,
      WHO LIVED IN THE SHOE.

    And this is the end of a tale that is true,
    Of a wonderful bed in a wonderful shoe,
    That the children got in, two by two,
    Urged by the stick so long and thick,
    That followed the broth so weak and thin,
    With never a bit of bread therein,
    Made for the children, quite a score--
    Perhaps one less, perhaps one more--
    Who worried the dame without a name,
      WHO LIVED IN THE SHOE.

FAIRY'S FRIENDS.


These are some of FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

[Illustration]

    This is little Miss Bo-Peep,
    She who often lost her sheep,
    Went home weeping sore, and found
    All her flock there safe and sound!
    This is little Miss Bo-Peep--
      ONE OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    This is Jack, and this is Jill,
    Who went forth their pail to fill,
    And came tumbling down the hill!
    Fairy says they do it still,
    This strange couple--Jack and Jill--
    AND THEY'RE FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

    This is lazy young Boy-Blue,
    Dull in all he had to do:
    Often Fairy and Bo-Peep
    Found him lying fast asleep,
    Heedless of his cows and sheep!
    This is lazy young Boy-Blue--
      ONE OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    This is wonderful Dame Hubbard--
    Name that always rhymes with cupboard--
    Ever going out to buy
    Something for her dog so sly,
    Who would oft her patience try!
    This is wonderful Dame Hubbard--
      ONE OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

    This is Master Simple Simon:
    Every day he meets a pie-man;
    Every day, so runs the tale,
    He will try to catch a whale,
    Fishing in his mother's pail!
    This is Master Simple Simon--
      ONE OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    This is Puss-in-Boots, so clever,
    In all dangers ready ever,
    In his labours failing never:
    Puss-in-Boots, who has a name
    Noted on the rolls of Fame!
    This is Puss-in-Boots, so clever--
      ONE OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    This is Giant-killing Jack,
    With his bugle on his back,
    With his sword so keen and bright,
    Ready ever foes to smite!
    This is Giant-killing Jack--
      ONE OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

    This, too, is that other Jack--
    He who, fearless of attack,
    Dared the magic stalk to climb,
    Facing giants many a time!
    This is Master Bean-stalk Jack--
      ONE OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    This is just a little gnome,
    One of those that make their home
    In the mines beneath the ground
    Where the precious gold is found!
    This is just a little gnome--
      ONE OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

[Illustration]

    This is Master Johnnie Horner,
    Sitting crying in a corner;
    Many stop and ask him why,
    And to all he makes reply,
    "'Cause no plums are in the pie!"
    This is selfish Johnnie Horner--
    WORST OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

[Illustration]

    This is Cinderella sweet,
    With her slippers on her feet:
    Cinderella at the ball,
    Cinderella loved by all!
    This is Cinderella sweet--
      BEST OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.

    This is where the story ends
    Of Miss Fairy's many friends:
    Others--fairies, gnomes, and elves--
    You can think of for yourselves!
    This is where the story ends
            OF FAIRY'S FRIENDS.




PEACE AND WAR.


    Fairy, when she was not dreaming,
    Fairy, when she was not scheming
    Wondrous tales of gnome and elf,
    Oft drew pictures for herself,
    Fanciful as they could be:
    Two are here for you to see.

    This is Peace: a little maiden
      Who has gleaned all through the day,
    Going home with arms well laden,
      When the sunlight fades away.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    This is War: a baby brother
      Threatened by a wasp that stings,
    Getting ready soon to smother
      That fierce yellow thing with wings.




FAIRY'S DREAM


    Fairy fell asleep one day
      With her album in her hand,
    And she dreamt she lost her way
      On the edge of Fairyland.

    There she met a little man.
      Quaintly dressed, with cap and bells:

[Illustration]

    "Read," he said, "Miss, if you can,
    All the words the sign-post tells.

    "Though your album you may fill
    With our portraits, understand
    Hundreds more await you still
    Here in wondrous Fairyland."

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
