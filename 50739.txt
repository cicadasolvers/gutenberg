PREFACE.


The Church, desirous of filling our minds with pious thoughts from the
beginning to the end of the year, has encouraged, and in some cases
designated, certain devotions to be practised, and sets aside a whole
month in which the prevailing thought ought to be centred on a certain
devotion. Not that the Church has by any decree appointed a special
devotion for any particular time, except in the cases of Advent and Lent;
but the universal piety of the people has adopted them; and each month has
its particular devotion.

The Church celebrates the feast of the Sacred Heart in June, and during
this month we may offer our prayers in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,
that our souls may be thoroughly imbued with the beauty of this devotion.

The Church celebrates the feast of the Holy Rosary on the first Sunday of
October, and our Holy Father Leo XIII. has ordered that the Rosary be
recited each day during the month.

The feast of the Guardian Angel is celebrated on the second of October;
thus two devotions are practised during this month. The Church has
arranged some special devotion for each month by which our confidence in
God is increased, and our love of holy Church intensified. What a rich
treasure of piety and love for God may a good Catholic not gather from one
year of such holy practices!





JANUARY. THE HOLY INFANCY.


The month of the holy infancy of Our Lord is January. The Lord was born in
December as we know, but so late in the month that we must take the
beginning of the new year and consecrate the first part of the year to
God. We begin with the childhood of Our Lord in our devotions, that we may
grow as He did in grace before God and man. The holy Infant is laid in our
arms this month, that we may contemplate Him and learn holy lessons. What
are these lessons? The goodness of God towards us--the mercy and kindness
of the Child Jesus for us; for His infancy is infinitely meritorious
before God, and all grace comes to us on account of Christ, Who has been
an Infant among us. We should be like children in our confidence in God,
Who has created us and will not make us stand greater trials than we are
able to bear. We should not care over much for the things of this world;
we should not depend so much on our own efforts; but with filial
resignation we should say to God: "You want this done, and you want one to
do it. Well, then, give me the grace, the intelligence, the will, and I
will do it in such a manner as will be worthy of God." The whole month can
be spent in meditating on these virtues; be assured they are worth being
learned, and will repay you for the trouble of practising them.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


Consider the Holy Family on this day. They rise early to make preparations
to proceed to the Temple to fulfil the law of God given to Moses, that
every male child of the Jewish nation should be circumcised. Let us
accompany them in spirit to the Temple, and witness God's providence
working plainly in behalf of His divine Son. To-day the Child Jesus is
circumcised. A painful operation is performed on the body of the pure and
holy Babe which was formed in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Jesus knew that
by this ceremony He subjected Himself to the Law, and the observance of
all the dictates of a life regulated by it. Be you also subject to the law
of God, hard though it may be to man's corrupt nature. The life of a
Christian will be a difficult one if you are not good and pious. It will
be hard for you to pray, to fast, to go to Mass, or confession. Only by
submitting to the law of God will you learn to bear your burdens
patiently, willingly, and joyfully. Remember you are not carrying your
cross alone, for the great Bearer of the cross, Our Lord Jesus Christ,
will help you: He Who has said, "My yoke is sweet and My burden light."

Prayer.

O God, Who, by the fruitful virginity of Blessed Mary, hast bestowed on
mankind the rewards of eternal salvation, grant, we beseech Thee, that we
may experience the intercession of her through whom we have had the
happiness to receive the Author of life, Our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.



Second Day.


Jesus underwent the circumcision as an act of redemption. He was carried
forth by His holy Mother to begin the way of the cross, and from that
moment until the day of His death He suffered physical pain. You may here
form many thoughts on this period in the life of this holy Child, which
will console you in your sufferings. Be not cast down in your struggle
after a livelihood, be not impatient in poverty and suffering, for by
these Jesus has redeemed the world. These crosses will one day bring you
to heaven. All humanity from childhood has the vicissitudes of nature and
fortune to combat. Cruel indeed is the fate of some children: poverty,
neglect, sickness, the death of parents, and other misfortunes, leave them
often in a deplorable state. But there is a Providence watching over them;
not a sparrow falls from the housetop without the will of the heavenly
Father. At the same time those who have the means should be interested in
God's poor, and seek to help them in all their necessities.

Prayer.

O Jesus, when Thou givest me such touching proof of Thy love, could I
remain cold towards Thee? No! it is not possible. I will love Thee, then,
O my God, with a love which nothing will daunt or repel.



Third Day.


At the presentation of the Lord in the Temple were present Simeon and
Anna; they were faithful people, and were permitted to witness the solemn
entry of Our Lord into the Temple. They were old and had served the Lord
God with faithfulness all their days, and were now waiting for the coming
of the Messias. On this day their fidelity was partially rewarded. It was
certainly a great grace to be allowed to witness the presentation of Jesus
to God, His Father, and this great reward for a good life was followed
afterwards by eternal happiness in heaven. Be faithful, then, to the
teachings of God in His holy Church. Begin in your youth, or at least when
the grace of God visits you. Never cease to trust in God during your whole
life, so that you, too, may be received into the heavenly kingdom as a
reward for your fidelity. Pray always, as Simeon and Anna did, who never
left the Temple but remained there in prayer and fasting, waiting for the
consolation of Israel.

Prayer.

O my God, how Thou didst love me on the day of Thy presentation! Oh, how
well Thou dost teach me thereby what love is when it burns the heart! O my
God! come and consume me, come and take possession of my whole being, so
that I may belong entirely to Thee. Let Thy good pleasure dispose of me as
Thou willest. Amen.



Fourth Day.


On the occasion of the circumcision, the name of Jesus was given to Our
Lord. He was called Jesus, the Redeemer: a name which was given to Him by
His Father and announced to man by an angel. Let this holy name be on your
lips--it will be to you a light, guiding you on your way through this
valley of darkness. Let it be your food, to strengthen you on your journey
to your heavenly home. Let it be a watchword at the end of your life, by
which you may open the gates of heaven. The name of Jesus is a powerful
one; it is the conqueror of death, the victor over hell. You are a
follower of Jesus, therefore you ought to show yourself an enthusiastic
follower, and love to repeat that sacred name. The name of Jesus piously
said will strengthen our good resolutions, and our resistance against
temptations. When the end of life approaches, and the darkness of despair
comes over us because we have done so little in the hours of daylight,
when we should have worked, the merits of Jesus will give us hope, for He
came to this earth to suffer for us, to give us hope, and to supply the
deficiency of our efforts.

Prayer.

Oh, may the adorable name of Jesus be the sweet and daily music of my soul
and the seal of my heart; and when, in the agony and cold sweat of death,
I shall give the last look for mercy, may the parting sigh of my soul be
Jesus. Amen, sweet Jesus, Amen.



Fifth Day.


The name of Jesus must not only be on our lips, but it must also be
indelibly engraven in our hearts. You have heard perhaps in the life of
that blessed Dominican, Suso, that he cut over his heart the name of
Jesus. In this name you can overcome all things. In this name you will be
rich in grace and strength, you will be victorious over all temptations
and successful in all your labors. Why should you not have the name of
Jesus in your heart? St. Paul has said: "Whosoever shall call upon the
name of the Lord, shall be saved." You remember the exclamation of the
great Apostle, "If any man love not Our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
anathema." There is great peace and comfort in the name of Jesus; it is
this which enables pious people to remain faithful for long years in
dryness of the spiritual life. It is this which gives us courage to do
good actions, not for an earthly gain, but for Jesus, and the reward of
His society for all eternity. Let us never pronounce it except with
confidence, respect, love, and delight.

Prayer.

O sweet Jesus! O loving Jesus! O Jesus, Son of the Virgin Mary, full of
piety and of love! O sweet Jesus, according to Thy great mercy have mercy
on me; blot out my iniquities, and look with tenderness upon me, a
miserable sinner invoking Thy holy name, Jesus. Amen.



Sixth Day.


The Lord has commended His holy name to every Christian as a precious
jewel which he is to use to obtain mercy and grace. "That whatsoever you
shall ask of the Father in My name, He may give it you." We all belong to
the army of the Lord, stand under His banner, and are supposed to be ever
ready to make battle in His cause. How often have not you received the
body and blood of the Lord? Think, then, what efficacy your prayers have
when you appear before God, with the sign of the blood of Jesus on your
soul; you then pray with a power to which nothing is equal, for not only
do you pray, but Christ prays in and by you. By this holy name God is
honored, as He is honored in His adorable Son. "God hath given Him a name
which is above all names."--Phil. ii. 9. The Lord is always an intercessor
for us--it is His office of Redeemer and Saviour that has merited this
name, by His life on earth and His death on the cross. To-day is the feast
of the Epiphany, the manifestation of the Lord Himself to the Gentiles.
Let us thank God during the day by frequent outbursts of love, for our
vocation to the faith in the person of the Magi.

Prayer.

O God! Who didst this day reveal Thy only-begotten Son to the Gentiles by
the guidance of a star; grant in Thy mercy, that we, who already know Thee
by faith, may be brought to contemplate the beauty of Thy majesty, through
the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.



Seventh Day.


The Lord has shown Himself to you also, as He did to the three Wise Men
from the East who represented you on the feast of Epiphany. You have had
mercy shown you on this day because now you have the right to choose the
true faith, and you should be thankful for this grace. You have had a
singular privilege extended to you, which all Christians do not enjoy to
the fulness. There are among us many who have not the consolation of dying
in the arms of Jesus. They cannot claim that He said to them, "I am the
Resurrection and the Life." We know that they, too, are hastening with us
to the Last Judgment, but with what a difference! When a misfortune
befalls these men in life they have no peace of mind; when a humiliation
meets them, the ungentle spirit of nature is aroused in them at being
despised. They are unhappy in privations, impatient in disputes, and they
are selfish. The life of those who think not of Christ is full of misery,
disappointment, and dissatisfaction; they sit in the darkness of
heathenism; but you who have the faith find relief in all your ills. Be
not one of those who by their sinfulness deserve to be deserted by God.

Prayer.

Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, in Thy heavenly mercy, the prayers of Thy
suppliant people; that they may perceive where their duty lies, and be
enabled to accomplish whatsoever tasks are necessary for their salvation.
Amen.



Eighth Day.


Our faith ought to be pure and precious as the gold which the wise kings
offered at the throne of God. You ought, then, to hold fast the faith of
Jesus Christ, which is preserved in the Catholic Church. Learn your faith,
learn the proofs of it; you will be a more fervent adherent to the chair
of St. Peter and be well instructed in everything that concerns the
Church. You will pray for our Holy Father, the Pope, and for holy Mother
Church in these troublous times. If love is a part of that purity of
faith, read nothing, listen to nothing which is against your faith; do not
belong to societies that are condemned by the Church, for they are enemies
of God's religion. Your faith must be a lively one; give signs of it in
your actions. Sweet-smelling as the incense in the hands of the kings must
be our faith. Every one should see that we are good and stanch Catholics;
education or riches or social standing should not be an obstacle to our
humble practice of our religion. What is there more beautiful than a well-
educated man practising the Catholic faith according to the laws of the
Church? Unhappily the rich and the learned are sometimes ashamed of the
Church, leaving it to the poor and ignorant to be good Catholics.

Prayer.

O my God, I thank Thee for the inestimable gift of faith which Thou hast
bestowed upon me. Grant that I may always acknowledge this Thy mercy with
thanksgiving; and this not only in words, but in making a good use of it.
This grace I ask through Thy sweet name, Jesus. Amen.



Ninth Day.


In trying to lead a good Christian life you will often meet with
contradictions and persecutions, even from your associates. But the Wise
Men included the myrrh of mortification among their gifts. He who wants to
lead a life of purity will necessarily meet with many persecutions and
crosses, and only when he has taken up the cross can he follow the divine
Redeemer. The faith of Christ cannot exist without the bitter herb of
mortification. This faith is the power that conquers the world, and the
world's insults. Let us then be firm in our faith as the three kings were
in all their trials, for they had many a one to encounter before they
found the cave of Bethlehem. Let us show our appreciation then by our zeal
and our holy lives. "He is my God, and I will glorify Him: the God of my
father, and I will exalt Him."--Exod. xv. 2. The holy man Job will be an
example to us as to how we should serve God in trials and tribulations.
Though the Lord allowed great sufferings to come upon him, and precisely
because he had been good, still he remained true and firm and would not
make a compromise with the devil, his persecutor. Job was thankful for
everything that came from the hands of God. He praised God for it all his
days.

Prayer.

O my God, how good it is to serve Thee thus, and to give ourselves wholly
to Thee. Give to me as Thou didst to the Magi the spirit of wisdom, of
prayer, and of sacrifice, so that, following Thee through all my life, I
may reach a happy eternity. Amen.



Tenth Day.


It is a singular fact that the star disappeared at Jerusalem, though that
was not, as yet, the place where the new-born King of the Jews was to be
looked for. Herod was the temporal king of Jerusalem; the high priest and
the doctors of the Law were also there. As this was the seat of the
religion of the people of God, here were made many prophecies that were to
be accomplished. We should have thought that here also the star would have
been seen. Jerusalem, however, remains in darkness, the people that were
to be the recipients of God's promises are passed over, and the great
grace of vocation was given to men who knew nothing of the testament of
God--to pagans. The star appears to them and illuminates the darkness in
which they find themselves, and calls them to a heavenly light. Our Lord
explained this Himself afterwards, when He said that from the rising to
the setting of the sun would come those who would sit at His banquet,
while the "children of the kingdom" should go out empty-handed, for they
deserved no better treatment because of their infidelity and presumption.

Prayer.

O God, Who didst permit the children of Israel so often to sink under the
trials which Thou didst send them, and so often to offend by yielding
under temptation: have regard, I beseech Thee, to Thy servant, and assist
me with heavenly strength that I may have patience and courage under all
the trials of life. Amen.



Eleventh Day.


We are similar in condition to Jerusalem: We have the promise of God, we
have the Messias in our midst, on our altars. Jerusalem was the gay
capital of the Jewish nation, and it had no time to attend to the call of
God. We also will meet the same fate that overtook that unfortunate city,
which knew not the day of its visitation. Our Lord "came unto His own, and
His own received Him not." We are too busy with the things of this world
to give a few thoughts to God; we do not realize the precious gifts of Our
Lord, or of His sacred presence, and so we will be allowed to go forth
empty-handed; strangers will take our places in the heavenly kingdom,
while we shall sit in darkness for all eternity. The Lord will find
faithful followers among strangers who have not our knowledge; they are
guided only by a star that does not speak. They follow it and are
rewarded; they follow it because they acknowledge the fact that they stand
in need of a leader and guide.

Prayer.

Help me, O my God, and defend me from all dangers; let Thy heavenly light
dart upon my soul amidst all its darkness; let faith be its guide, and
support it with hope. Behold, I now protest that I renounce all kinds of
suggestions that are injurious to that faith and hope which I am bound to
have in Thee. Amen.



Twelfth Day.


Mary was found with the Child by the Magi; she it was who received the
gifts for the Lord. There sat Mary as on a throne, having the Infant Jesus
in her lap, and the Wise Men fell down and adored Him. How kingly seemed
to them the poverty of that Babe! how right royal that sinless Mother's
lap, on which He was enthroned! We, too, have arrived at the stable of
Bethlehem in our meditations. Mary is there, holding out towards us also
her divine Son. Through her He has become ours in holy communion, ours
when we are faithful servants of this good Master. Mary is always with
Jesus; we cannot think of the sacred humanity of Christ without thinking
also of the Mother who gave Him birth. How far removed is the Mother from
the Son? Let us then bow down in humility and adoration before the Child
who is Our God; but let us also look up to Mary. She teaches us God as we
never could else have learned Him. The Child Jesus seems to understand
better than we that the caresses which are poured out to Him are also
intended for us. Let us look with gratitude at this good Mother of Jesus,
who is to be our Mother because she has taken us under her protection, and
presents our petitions to the divine Infant, her sweet Son.

Prayer.

O Mary, my good Mother, I cast myself into thy arms: obtain for me from
thy divine Son the virtues of humility and charity, great purity of heart,
of body, and of soul, final perseverance in good, the gift of fervor in
prayer, a pious life, and a happy death. Amen.



Thirteenth Day.


Mary is present at our visit to Jesus, to receive the gifts that we are
about to bring to the Infant at this sacred season, when we celebrate the
feast of Epiphany. We are going to offer to Jesus, through Mary, a gift of
gold. Gold is the most precious and the most sought after possession in
the world. Whatever we have most precious, then, we will give to Him: our
attachment to our family, our inclinations, our prejudices, our
possessions, we will lay at the feet of Jesus, so that Mary may point them
out to this sacred Babe, and show Him how generous we have been to make a
sacrifice of the dearest things we have on earth. The man of the world
makes supreme efforts to gain gold, so we will make supreme efforts to
bring our whole being, with all its energies, as a sacrifice to Him; our
hearts with all their inclinations will be consecrated to the service of
Jesus Christ. We will love Him not only in Himself, but in our neighbor;
we will succor Him in the person of the poor, and in those even of whom we
have to complain; and that on account of His words, "As long as you did it
to one of these, My least brethren, you did it to Me."--Matt. xxv. 40.

Prayer.

O my Mother, give me Jesus as thou didst give Him to the holy Wise Men.
Obtain for me a fervent heart to desire Jesus; a pure and humble heart to
receive Jesus; a constant heart, that I may never, by the least wilful
sin, sadden His loving Heart. Amen.



Fourteenth Day.


During these days make the sacrifice of your heart a persevering, loving,
patient sacrifice. You are not going to retain anything of this heart, you
are not going to divide your love. Jesus has given Himself entirely to
you; He has been presented to you by the hands of Mary. He has made you a
Christian, that you may take advantage of this privilege of enjoying Him
as often as you please. You can be on familiar terms with Him, you can
unite Him to your heart in holy communion, when He will enter your soul
and be such a gracious, noble guest. By your Christian character He has
privileged you to participate in all the sacraments of the Church. He
confirms you in your Christianity; He pardons your transgressions when you
have fallen, and when, with sorrow in your heart, you wish to rise again;
He claims you as His at the end of your life by anointing you in your last
sickness: He claims you in fact, body and soul, for His own glory.

Prayer.

Most sweet Infant Jesus, I acknowledge Thee my benefactor. I return Thee
thanks for whatever I possess, and I heartily beg Thy grace, that I may
make good use of the benefits which through Thy great mercy I enjoy. Amen.



Fifteenth Day.


You are going to appear before Jesus and Mary during these days with the
incense of the Magi, which they presented to Him as a tribute of praise;
they acknowledged Jesus as their God. Incense is offered to God alone; it
is a prayer in itself, and ascends with a pleasant odor. You are going to
stand before Jesus offering your incense of prayer and adoration. You have
your daily prayers to say; in fact the whole day should be a prayer, which
should insert itself into all your actions. How noble will not such a day
appear to you when you look back on it! Oh, that all your days were like
this one, full of holy joy, peace and happiness; such a happiness as you
cannot find in earthly pleasure and enjoyment. Mary will receive this gift
of prayer for her divine Son, and point out to Him the pious Christian
that has brought the same sacrifice as did the kings of the East--the
incense of prayer. How pleased will be our sweet Jesus to receive this
gift from our hands, and in exchange He will give us the gift of piety,
thus enabling us to love God alone and to despise all else.

Prayer.

Hail, most sweet Jesus, Son of God and of Mary, I love Thee with my whole
soul, and above all things, because Thou art infinitely worthy of all
love. I firmly resolve by Thy grace to sin no more, and henceforth to
avoid all occasions of sin. Amen.



Sixteenth Day.


Mary is found with Jesus, too, in order to accept another gift, which you
must not forget and which the Magi brought also, i.e., the bitter myrrh of
mortification. We have seen that we should offer a pure heart to the Lord
and a life full of prayer--but we must also add to these gifts the virtues
of self-denial, self-abnegation and mortification. Mary offered this great
gift of generosity in its fulness. She is the Queen of martyrs, the
sorrowful Mother. Mourn with her over your own ingratitude and the sins of
the world; follow her in the way of the cross of her life; condole with
her. It is a precious gift to God to mortify one's self, and one can find
daily opportunities of doing so. As a Christian you are not to look
backward. Give the same gifts as the Magi did; put some little privation
on yourself, no matter what it may be, or how insignificant it may appear.
God will look upon it with eyes of love, and in return will enrich you
with the spirit of mortification and of sacrifice, which will make you
apostles and martyrs.

Prayer.

O most sweet Infant Jesus! grant me, as Thou didst to the Magi, the spirit
of wisdom, of prayer, and of sacrifice; so that following their example of
steadfast faith, I may one day receive the reward of eternal happiness.
Amen.



Seventeenth Day.


We read that the Lord accompanied His parents on a visit to the Temple in
Jerusalem, and remained there unknown to them, when they had departed for
their own home. It was His Father's house, and He expressed a kind of
wonder that He was expected to be anywhere else at any time. We might
apply this to ourselves as well. God is Our Father; the church is Our
Father's house, and we should be found at home. Besides, Jesus is in the
tabernacle; He, our Brother, is in His Father's house, and the whole
family should be gathered there. You should make frequent visits to the
church, and should any one be surprised at your conduct, and ask you the
reason, you can answer with justice: "Am I not to be about the things that
are my Father's?" Go to your work, be in your home, but also love to pass
some time in the presence of the Lord in the church. The angels are there,
silently praying before their God in the tabernacle; join them in their
devout occupation. You like to visit a friend; no nearer nor dearer friend
will you ever find than Jesus, your loving Saviour.

Prayer.

O Jesus, Thou knowest my desire of serving Thee with the purest intention
of living but for Thee. Thou art my hope, my strength, and my life. I will
seek not so much for consolation as for the grace of a greater love
towards Thee, my sweet Saviour, and for strength to suffer bravely for Thy
greater glory and my own sanctification. Amen.



Eighteenth Day.


From your early childhood you have been brought to the church. Even before
you knew what church meant you trotted along with the other children, and
sat in your pew and knelt with the rest, not knowing how to pray, not
knowing what you were about. But afterwards you began to understand that
you were going to a holy place, where sacred things were performed: things
that reminded you of heaven, even while you were still on this earth. When
you were made a Christian by Baptism, then you were introduced into the
mystic body of the Church, and you also received the right to stand in the
material temple of the Lord, and take your place among the many members of
the Christian people. The Church has become your home, a place of
happiness and consolation in all your afflictions. But do we use it as
such? Do we go with all our trials and temptations to our sweet Lord,
hidden in the tabernacle, Who is there waiting and anxious to console us
in our miseries?

Prayer.

My dearest Jesus, how much hast Thou not done to oblige me to love Thee,
and how much hath it cost Thee to gain to Thyself my love? Pierce my poor
soul, O dearest Jesus, with the sweet dart of Thy love, so that I may ever
languish with desire of Thee. Amen.



Nineteenth Day.


When the shepherds were told to seek for the Child Jesus, they were sent
to look for a child. When we set out to look for the Redeemer we expect to
see something remarkable; with fear and trembling we approach the spot,
and find only a helpless Child lying on some straw in a manger. Man looks
for great and startling works, and God meets him by showing things which,
in his consideration, are insignificant. We think that God should choose
great things and He chooses small ones. This is the difference between
divine and human reasoning, between the ways of God and the ways of man.
God has become man in the form of a child, and human wisdom thinks that
now, over the whole world, a great clamor, noise, and wonderment should be
raised; that all nations should be astounded. Instead the Lord is a child
that does not talk, does nothing wonderful, even cries like other
children, and so He remains, or rather grows, gaining by degrees the use
of human faculties the same as other children. These are the ways of God;
we think we should have ordered all things differently.

Prayer.

O sweet Babe of Bethlehem, I adore Thee in Thy humility. Mayest Thou be
ever reverenced and adored by all creatures. May we with the angels ever
adore Thee, and may the hearts of all the faithful ever breathe out in Thy
honor a most sweet perfume. Amen.



Twentieth Day.


What a difference! Adam was placed in paradise, a most beautiful garden;
the second Adam, Jesus, is placed in the manger. The former was but a
simple human being, while this One is the true God. And why was this
difference made? Through Adam's sin paradise, that beautiful place, had
been desecrated: God, the Author of our being, forgotten. In punishment of
this rebellion the second Adam had to atone for this defection. We had
lowered ourselves to the level of the animals, we had sought our joy among
the natural inclinations, and thither Our Lord had to descend in order to
find us. Paradise is again to be brought to this earth. We, too, should
show by our faith, our devotions, and our magnificent churches, where our
happiness is. We may enjoy this paradise even on earth by doing the will
of God in all things, and receiving frequently the body and blood of
Christ, in the Holy Sacrament of the Altar.

Prayer.

O most sweet Infant Jesus, behold here a poor petitioner who wants Thy
aid; but such is my unhappiness, the more I want the less able I am to ask
for relief. Have regard, therefore, to my distressed condition, and
according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies have compassion on me.
Amen.



Twenty-first Day.


The angels announced the glad tidings of the birth of Christ to the
shepherds, who heard the words and acted on them promptly and with joy,
ignorant though they were. The promise of the coming of a Redeemer was
clearly placed before their minds, so that they were as prepared for this
startling announcement as if they had been waiting for it for many years.
So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Infant. How
beautiful is Our Lord's attraction to the lowly, represented in the call
of these poor men. Such are the men that the Babe called first. We should
allow the glorious truths of the incarnation to sink deeply into our
souls, that we may celebrate the month of the holy childhood with profit
to ourselves and to the glory of God. We should be interested also in
spreading the Gospel among Protestants and Jews, and by our lives lead bad
Catholics back again to the Infant Babe. Lay people can sometimes do more
good than they imagine, and in some cases even more than a priest, because
their advice and good example may have an effect where a priest could not
reach.

Prayer.

O most sweet Babe of Bethlehem! what praise, love, and thanks shall I
return Thee for all Thy mercies? Let my body, soul, and all that is within
me bless Thee eternally, and let heaven, earth, and all that is within
them say Amen.



Twenty-second Day.


God's glory was the object of the angels who came to announce the birth of
Our Lord. Glory to God in the highest! Infinite glory accrues to God the
Father by sending His divine Son to this earth to become man. We are His
intelligent creatures, to whom He was sent, and we must give to God a
rational worship. When we do not give glory and thanks to God, and are
ungrateful, we rob the Creator of that recognition which He should have
from His creatures. But the same must be said of all our works; we must
have the glory of God before our minds; we should do nothing but with the
express or implicit motive--the honor of God. Our maxim should be, "All for
the greater glory of God." When the angels reported the birth of the Lord
they did not refer to their own greatness but sang out, "God has done this
from His throne in heaven," to Him is due the glorification of His
creatures; so also we, after a good action, do not think complacently of
our own sanctity or excellence, but say it was the inspiration of God, and
God's work, which has been done by us unworthy instruments in His hands.
Mary referred all her glory and graces to God: "My soul doth magnify the
Lord."

Prayer.

Almighty and everlasting God! Lord of heaven and earth, Who dost reveal
Thyself to little ones, grant us, we beseech Thee, to honor meetly the
holy mysteries in the life of Thy Son, the Child Jesus, and to follow Him
humbly in our lives, so that we may come to the eternal kingdom promised
by Thee to little ones, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.



Twenty-third Day.


Again the angels said, "Peace on earth to men of good-will." How precious
is the peace of the soul! Peace is the fruit of a good conscience, which
produces peace with God and with one's self. Seek to purify your will,
make it conformable to the will of God, for then you enjoy peace more and
more; you will taste the happiness of that peace which surpasses all the
joys of the world, and which the world cannot give. In the contemplation
of the joyous feasts which we celebrate, during this month of the
mysteries of the divine infancy of the Lord, we will find the happiness of
our soul. Continue in your adoration of the Infant Jesus, bring Him the
grateful thanks of a pure heart, pray with earnestness, with perseverance,
for the mercy of God, which He can extend to you in answer to your
supplications if you are sincere. Remember the words of the angels, "Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good-will." It is a
saying which is worth repeating to yourself.

Prayer.

O most amiable Jesus, who for my sake and instruction didst vouchsafe to
conceal Thy eternal wisdom under the weakness of childhood! I most humbly
thank Thee for having shown me in Thy own sacred person how I should
sanctify my youth, and thereby draw a blessing on my future life. Amen.



Twenty-fourth Day.


"Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart."--Luke ii. 19.
Twice do we read that Mary did this. The Holy Ghost certainly wished to
attract our attention to this fact, that we might imitate the action. All
that was done and all that was said made a great impression on Mary's
heart. She merited more and more the eulogiums which God Himself bestows
on those who hear the word of God and keep it. The facts and the words of
the incarnation must be the same to us--precious thoughts and gifts which
we know how to value and appreciate. At certain times we should give
evidence of our belief in the joy of our heart. God's glory must be
published externally, we must not bury it in our hearts only, for Mary
preserved all these words in her heart so as to make them public at some
future time, for the welfare of the Church. With greatest devotion and
zeal she had heard the revelations of God; with liberality she made
manifest the fulness of her heart for the glory of God.

Prayer.

O Wisdom, Who didst proceed out of the mouth of the Most High, reaching
from end to end, with might and with sweetness disposing all things, come
and teach us the way of prudence. Amen.



Twenty-fifth Day.


Mary not only kept all these words in her heart, but she also meditated on
them. In fact the meaning of the words, "kept in her heart," is that they
were ever fresh there; she kept the eyes of her soul on them, and thought
of them; she was part of the workings of God's providence, and had no
other thought than that the will of God should be done in all things,
especially just now, in this instance of the childhood of Christ. Men and
angels had brought her the testimony of their admiration of the wonderful
works of God; and Mary was consoled and confirmed in her willingness to
suffer everything for her divine Infant Son. To us also the meditation and
the consideration of God's infinite goodness, and the facts of revelation,
are the very centre-post around which the Christian life should move. Be
not a passive Christian that is borne along in the crowd; go a little
farther, and become an intelligent worshipper, who has reflected well on
religious tenets, and to whom they have given a great deal of consolation
and hope of future happiness.

Prayer.

O Adonai and leader of the house of Israel! Who didst appear to Moses in
the fire of the flaming bush, and didst give him the Law of Sinai: come
and save us with a stretched-forth arm. Amen.



Twenty-sixth Day.


We are often solicitous about temporal affairs: our eating, drinking,
clothing, and that which is dependent on us. We are right in making all
necessary efforts, but we must not forget God, or lose confidence in Him.
The Magi left their kingdoms, palaces, families, their great comforts of
home, and went on a long journey, led by the star, without being clearly
told how far their journey was to carry them. They had to travel through
unknown lands, under a burning sun, exposed to wild beasts, and the enmity
of wandering tribes. Still they persevered until they were rewarded by the
sight of the Messias, the Redeemer of the world. Then "they rejoiced with
exceeding great joy." This is also a lesson to us to quiet our fears. God
knows what we have done for Him, and a thousand-fold will He reward our
generous actions, and at the same time our families will be protected and
our wants supplied. "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and His justice:
and all these things shall be added unto you."--Luke xii. 31.

Prayer.

O Root of Jesse! Who art a signal to the people, in Whose presence kings
shall be silent, and to Whom the Gentiles shall pray: come and deliver us
now and delay not. Amen.



Twenty-seventh Day.


The revelation which you have received from God ought to enter deeply into
your soul. Mary's heart was full of grace. You should receive God's word
into your hearts, that it may be the nourishment of your souls, that it
may fill you with holy sentiments and desires, and model you according to
the life of Christ. During these days you have given much thought to the
birth of Our Lord. Be careful in your prayers not to keep it on your lips
only, but let it take deep root in your hearts, so that Christ may be born
again in your souls. Pray to Mary, to the angels, and to the saints, that
they may assist you; that you may preserve the deposit of faith with
fidelity as they preserved it, for the nourishment of the spirit and the
sanctification of your soul, and of others that may be intrusted to your
care. Your piety and love of the Lord should increase with these
meditations. "Thy word is exceedingly refined: and Thy servant hath loved
it."--Ps. cxviii. 140.

Prayer.

O Key of David and sceptre of the house of Israel! Who openest, and no man
shutteth: Who shuttest, and no man openeth; come and take out of prison
him that is in fetters, and who sitteth in darkness and in the shadow of
death. Amen.



Twenty-eighth Day.


The obedience of Our Lord to His parents is an admirable lesson. Jesus
Christ is obedient, and submits His infinite wisdom to the commands of
human beings. Not only was He obedient to His heavenly Father even unto
the death of the cross, but He exactly fulfilled all the requirements of
the Fourth Commandment without a murmur, without deferring the execution
of His parents' wishes to a time more suitable to Himself. St. Bernard
says that he is obedient who fulfils a command without delay, and with a
cheerful heart. Our Lord fulfilled this law so scrupulously because He
wished to leave us an example. Remember the fact that the Boy Jesus was
not only obedient to His heavenly Father, but also to His superiors
according to the order of things. The Lord left, without delay, the
performance of a holy action when He was called away from it. Our
obedience to the Church and its lawful pastors is also an obligation
devolving upon us. Children, obey your parents, servants, your masters,
citizens, the State and all constituted public authority. Religious fulfil
this law of obedience because they make a vow of obedience.

Prayer.

O Orient brightness of eternal light, and Sun of righteousness! come and
enlighten those that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death. Amen.



Twenty-ninth Day.


"Jesus advanced in wisdom and age, and grace with God and men."--Luke ii.
52. From the first instant of His sacred life on earth there were hidden
in the Lord all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. He constantly
developed these before the sight of men. The sun has always the same
abundance of heat and light, yet it still increases as the day wears on
until it stands in the zenith in all its glory and power, and as the day
wanes it, as it were, draws its power to itself. The older Jesus, the Sun
of justice, grew, the brighter became the light of His holy life, and it
illumined more and more the lives of those who observed Him. The growing
older is inevitable; as time passes we grow older, but we do not
necessarily grow in wisdom before God and men. Our piety before God is not
increased, and we frequently give scandal to men by our impiety. When we
were young we loved God, but as we grew older we were so implicated with
the things of this life that we lost a great deal of our simplicity. Why
should this be so?

Prayer.

O King of the Gentiles, and their desired One, the corner-stone that joins
the two walls! come and save man, whom Thou didst form out of dust. Amen.



Thirtieth Day.


Jesus was filled with grace and truth from the very beginning of His life.
We have seen His glory, the glory of the only Son of the Father, full of
grace and truth. More and more did His virtues, however, shine forth with
ever increasing splendor; men wondered at this glorious Being, loved Him,
and afterwards followed Him when He began His mission. We, too, were full
of grace at our Baptism, and long afterwards, in our childhood, we were
pleasing in the sight of God, because we were innocent children whom God
loved. We were then modest, pious, obedient, but in course of time we
sought to please men more than God. To please men is often to displease
God. We should have hungered and thirsted after justice, and this would
have kept alive in us the desire to grow in grace, wisdom and truth. But
now let us arouse ourselves, and even though we are old, let us strive to
become like the divine Infant. Let us, with the grace of God, renew in
ourselves the graces that were in us. Let us examine our conscience, and
see whether we have remained faithful to our good resolutions, if we have
ever made them before. It is not too late yet to resolve to do better in
the future.

Prayer.

O Emmanuel, King and Lawgiver! the expectation of the Gentiles and their
Saviour; come and save us, O Lord, Our God. Amen.



Thirty-first Day.


On this last day of the devotion of the holy infancy, let us endeavor to
make permanent the pious sentiments that have passed through our souls. We
wish to have Jesus in our hearts, not only for the present but also for
the future. It is not enough to find Jesus as the shepherds and the Magi
did, but we should try to keep ourselves always in His sacred presence.
The means to retain Jesus are no other than to keep ourselves in grace, to
avoid sin, to preserve His love in our hearts, and lastly to be watchful,
when temptation assails us, against sensuality, pride, avarice, and want
of charity, and any other vice. Let us remain close to Our Lord,
remembering our promises of fidelity, in a humble confidence that He will
assist us with His grace. Let us remember the words of the Royal Prophet
David: That a soul that fears God will not be affected by infidelity. Let
us repeat with the spouse in the Canticles: "I found Him Whom my soul
loveth: I held Him: and I will not let Him go." Who will separate me from
the love of Christ?

Prayer.

O Infant Jesus! grant that each moment of our lives, we may pay homage to
that moment in which Thou didst begin the work of our salvation. Amen.




Mass in Commemoration of the Holy Infancy of Jesus Christ.


Preparatory Prayer.

Deign, O almighty God, to give me the grace to remember, with devotion and
love during the holy sacrifice, the sacred birth, the Passion and death of
Thy Son, Jesus Christ. I offer to Thee, Thy divine Son by the hands of
Mary, His Virgin Mother, to the honor of Thy holy name, and in grateful
thanksgiving for the numberless graces and blessings which Thou hast
bestowed upon Thy poor creature. I offer Him also for the joy of the
heavenly court, as a victim of propitiation for my sins, for the living
and the dead, and for my special intention, which, with all confidence, I
recommend to Thee. Permit me to feel Thy sacred presence, to be immersed
in Thy pure light, and to be comforted by it, so that I may always, but
especially on this day, serve Thee faithfully, and bear the trials which
Thou sendest me with love and courage. In consideration of the tears and
the precious blood of Thy divine Son, by Whom I knock at the gates of Thy
mercy and kindness, grant that all misfortunes of body and soul may be
averted from me, through Christ Our Lord, Who is ever praised with Thee
and the Holy Ghost, for all eternity. Amen.

Introit.

O my God, I should be holy as Thou art holy, fountain of all sanctity; and
still Thou seest in me nothing pure. I am full of iniquity. Have mercy on
me, make manifest in me Thy mercy. I present to Thee, in sorrow and
humility, the Infant Jesus as my intercessor. Look upon Him, O heavenly
Father, the brightness of Thy own glory, now lying in a crib in a wretched
stable. And from that lowly bed He raises up His little hands, begging for
pardon, in order that we, His erring brothers and sisters, may be brought
back to Thy paternal Heart, and to ward off the punishment which we so
richly deserve. O divine Redeemer, despise not our confidence! Stretch out
Thy almighty right hand and draw us forth from the floods of our sins,
miseries, and iniquities, so that we may gratefully thank Thee and the
Father for all eternity. Amen.

Gospel.

We render Thee, O loving Jesus, our everlasting thanksgiving for having
descended from Thy unspeakable happiness in heaven to this miserable
earth, where Thou dost wish to console Thy needy creatures and to teach us
by Thy holy Gospel the way to heaven. Who would not approach Thee with
confidence, when he sees Thee, the infinite God, wrapped in swaddling-
clothes, resting on the bosom of the purest and tenderest of Mothers, with
hands full of graces and a Heart full of love! Even though untold misery
should overwhelm our hearts, and innumerable desires consume our souls,
still we would take confidence from this kindness and love, and our souls
would be filled with happiness and peace. Look upon me, then, O gracious
Infant! and by that look of kindness may my intellect be enlightened to
understand the divine truths; may my will be inflamed to fulfil Thy
commands and inspirations, and my memory continually suggest Thy promises
and Thy goodness. So that on the altar of my heart may be placed a triple
sacrifice of faith, hope, and charity, and then I can claim from Thy
majesty new graces and benedictions upon myself, upon those in whom I am
interested, and upon all those on whom the light of the Gospel has not
shone, that we may become vessels to Thy honor and love, and may praise
Thy mercies for all eternity. Amen.

Offertory.

As I kneel in spirit at the crib of Bethlehem, and see the divine Infant
offering Himself to the heavenly Father for my sins, so I bring, as an
offering with the priest, my poor heart which thirsts for Thee. Oh, that I
could offer Thee as gifts many virtuous acts! but bowed down in the dust
of my own nothingness, I cannot offer anything more than an empty,
sorrowful heart. Look upon it with mercy, and send upon it the dew of Thy
grace and love, which will quickly bear fruit of humility and meekness.
Adorn my soul with the flowers of devotion, that my whole life may become
a song of praise and petition for mercy. Amen.

Sanctus.

Unfathomable, O Lord God, are the depths of Thy mysteries, and wonderful
the inventions of Thy mercy. Faith teaches me that He Who is in the crib,
and weeps and trembles, is the One Whose thunder rolls in the clouds, at
the sound of Whose voice cherubim and seraphim veil their faces with their
wings. What a manifestation of humility and love do I contemplate in this!
Come, O Lord, with Thy all-conquering love, and enkindle my cold heart and
the hearts of all careless Christians with the flames of love! Come to me
in the fulness of Thy graces and blessings, and stir up my sluggish humor;
enlighten all needy souls with the abundance of Thy eternal brightness,
that we may now, and for all eternity, sing the angelic anthem: Holy,
holy, holy, is Our God! Amen.

The Secret.

O kind Father! in humility I beg of Thee, through Our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, may our sacrifice and prayers please Thee. Bless me, bless those
who are here present at this sacrifice, and bless also all who are needy
and suffering. I pray Thee especially for the holy Catholic Church and her
ministers, that Thou mayest keep them in peace and harmony; that Thou
mayest protect and govern them, and mayest pour into their souls that
peace which the divine Infant brought to this earth--Who alone is the cause
of the happiness which we enjoy here below. I wish to join the angels in
exclaiming, "Peace to my soul, peace to all men of good-will."

Consecration.

Look down, O Lord God the Father! on this altar where Thy divine Son
adores Thee as He did from the stable of Bethlehem, and offers Himself as
a spotless lamb as He did on Calvary. We unite our prayers with His, and
we beg of Thy unlimited mercy that Thou wouldst listen to the pleading of
this divine Heart and of this precious blood, and grant us what is
pleasing to Thee. Grant that we may grow in the odor of sanctity of Our
Lord Jesus Christ, and share with Him eternal happiness in heaven. Amen.

After The Consecration.

O divine Infant Jesus, give me the grace to realize the wonders of Thy
holy love! In all humility I consecrate myself to Thee as a holocaust to
Thy holy condescension. Oh, that I were able to adore Thee with that
sincere and heartfelt devotion with which the holy Virgin, St. Joseph, the
pious shepherds, the Magi, and all the fervent adorers of Thy divine
infancy adored Thee. With all my soul I will love Thee. All the movements
of my heart shall be directed towards Thee; my soul shall be Thy dwelling.
With Thy grace I will fulfil all the duties of my state in life. Change
this sinful man into a new being by Thy almighty love, by the same love
with which Thou hast changed the bread and wine into Thy adorable body and
blood. May Thy profound humility restrain the pride of my heart; may Thy
wonderful purity transform me into a lily of purity for the heavenly
garden, and Thy love guide me through the storms of this wretched life to
the habitation of bliss: to Thy throne, where ever and ever springs forth
life without end. Amen.

Commemoration Of The Dead.

Remember, also, O most merciful Jesus! all Thy servants who have departed
this life, marked with the seal of faith and charity, and who sleep the
sleep of peace. Let them all feel, according to their burning desire, the
power of the holy sacrifice of the Mass. Open to them the gates of heaven,
the abode of light and peace, that they may join the innumerable chorus of
angels and saints, who praise and love Thee for all eternity. Amen.

Agnus Dei.

O immaculate Lamb of God, suffering all human tribulations! teach me to
tear myself away from the affections of earthly things, which still keep
me from adhering solely to Thee. O gracious Lamb of God, Who didst descend
from heaven to bring grace and light into my needy soul! let the dew of
Thy kindness descend upon this barren land of my heart, to enrich it with
many virtues. O pure Lamb of God, Prince of peace and love! calm in my
soul all disquiet, and let it be inflamed with the flames of Thy holy
love, whence all my words and actions derive their merit. Amen.

Communion.

O dearest Jesus, my Redeemer! from the stable of Bethlehem Thou callest to
me, "Come to Me, all you that labor and are burdened, and I will refresh
you."--Matt. xi. 28. Pressed and overwhelmed with many trials, my soul
longs for Thee, and desires to partake of the heavenly banquet of Thy
flesh and blood, and to be united to Thee most intimately. Come, O Lord,
to comfort my languishing spirit! strengthen my weak resolutions; change
my whole being into something more pleasing to Thee. What heart is not
softened by Thy loving glance, and desires not to be one with Thee? Admit
my heart to a union with Thine, that both may be consumed together. As dry
wood easily takes fire from flames, so may my heart begin to burn
brightly, and whatever is displeasing to Thee be consumed by Thy holy
love. Let me find rest in the enjoyment of Thy divinity; and let me have
no earthly attachments, so that when I shall be loosed from the ties of
this world, I may fly to Thee, and rest in Thy bosom.


    Soul of Christ, sanctify me:
    Body of Christ, save me:
    Blood of Christ, inebriate me:
    Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
    Passion of Christ, strengthen me:
    O good Jesus, hear me:
    Within Thy wounds hide me:
    Permit me not to be separated from Thee.
    From the malignant enemy defend me:
    In the hour of my death call me,
    And bid me come to Thee,
    That, with Thy saints, I may praise Thee
    Forever and ever. Amen.


Conclusion.

Accept, O Blessed Trinity! my grateful thanks for the graces which Thou
hast poured upon my soul during this holy sacrifice, which I have attended
in honor of the holy infancy. And then, O divine Infant! permit me to
remain with Thee whilst I am engaged in the duties of my state in life.
Make me ever mindful of that gratitude which I ought to have for Thy holy
love; let me feel the truth of the words, "I have found Him Whom my soul
loveth"; I will never be separated from Him. Amen.

O Lord Jesus Christ, Who didst vouchsafe so to annihilate the greatness of
Thy incarnate divinity and most sacred humanity, as to be born in time,
and become a little child; grant that we may acknowledge infinite wisdom
in the silence of a child, power in weakness, majesty in abasement: so
that adoring Thy humiliations on earth, we may contemplate Thy glories in
heaven. Who with the Father and the Holy Ghost, livest and reignest, God,
forever and ever. Amen.

Communion Prayers in Honor of the Infant Jesus.


Preparation for Holy Communion.

1. I believe most firmly, my dear Jesus, that in the consecrated Host is
contained Thy humanity and Thy divinity, together with Thy sacred flesh
and blood. I believe in this mystery of our faith, because Thou, Who art
infinite wisdom, hast announced, "My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is
drink indeed." I believe as firmly as Thy holy Mother Mary believed in all
the sacred truths which Thou camest to preach. With the heart of Mary, O
divine Infant Jesus, I would love Thee! I would wish to receive Thee into
the shelter of my heart, as Mary didst receive Thee into her arms with
devotion and tenderness, and Thou didst find a resting-place. Cold and
dreary was everything about Thee, that night of Thy birth, but Thou didst
find a warm heart in Thy holy Mother. Let me embrace Thee with the same
fervor with which Joseph and Simeon welcomed Thee into their arms. Give me
now, O divine Infant Jesus, through the participation in Thy body and
blood, the burning love of Thy holy spirit, which induced Thee to become
my Brother. Thou didst institute this Holy Sacrament that I might be
united to Thee and Thou to me. I am heartily sorry that I have, hitherto,
preferred creatures to Thee, and so far have done nothing to deserve Thy
mercy. Forgive the sins for which I have had only a superficial sorrow,
and which I, perhaps, have confessed in the same spirit. Clothe me with
the garb of innocence of Thy holy childhood; by Thy adorable blood purify
me, by Thy holy spirit enliven me, that from the present I may no longer
live, but Thou, my Jesus, live in me forever.

O Holy Ghost, Who didst prepare the body of the Blessed Virgin Mary, by
the infusion of sanctity, to be a worthy habitation of the body of the
divine Infant Jesus, prostrate before Thee I beg that Thy grace may also
render my soul and body worthy to receive the body of Christ, that I may
receive Him with purity and faith, and may through the reception lay a
foundation of sanctity, which will entitle me to enter the glorious
kingdom of heaven.

O my good Jesus, my whole confidence is in Thee; Thy wounds and Thy sacred
blood encourage me to hope in the Lord.

O Son of the almighty God, Son of the Virgin Mary, hear me, and be
merciful unto me. My heart desires to receive Thee with the same joy and
desire with which Mary conceived Thee and gave Thee birth.

Come, then, dear Lord, and fashion my heart according to Thy will; and,
oh, holy saints, devout adorers of the Infant Jesus, St. Francis, St.
Anthony, St. Stanislaus, pray that my faith may be strong, that my hope
and confidence in the Infant Jesus may increase, that my love for Him and
His good Mother may burn with an inextinguishable flame.

And thou, my guardian angel, as well as arch-*angels and angels, cherubim
and seraphim, accompany me to the holy table of the Lord; cover me with
thy wings, for I am not worthy to receive this heavenly food.

2. O my God, my Lord, is it possible that Thou lovest me, a miserable
human being, so tenderly, that now Thou dost feed my soul with Thy
precious blood, with the bread of angels? By this sacred food Thou dost so
firmly unite me to Thee as to make us one; Thy soul unites itself with my
soul, and Thy body with my poor human nature. Rejoice, then, O my soul,
for no longer can it be said, "My tears have been my bread day and night:
whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God?"--Ps. xli. 4. For my food
is the bread of angels and my God is not far from me and my God is in my
soul! O dear Jesus, how liberal art Thou towards him that seeks Thee! How
can I make return for this great kindness?

3. Consider, O my soul, that as often as you receive communion, you
become, as it were, like Mary, the Mother of God, and a spouse of Jesus
Christ: for in holy communion you may consider that the Lord comes to you
as the little Child of Bethlehem. He becomes your Spouse because He loves
you, takes care of you, and caresses you. O my soul, with what energy you
ought to seek to acquire the virtues of our dear Mother Mary. She was
adorned with every virtue when the incarnation took place in her, and she
enjoyed the presence of her God.

Put yourself exclusively into the hands of God, and have the same
sentiments that Mary had when she said, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord,"
or with the spouse in the Canticles: "My Beloved is a bunch of myrrh which
rests in my bosom." And with Simeon, the prophet, exclaim, "Now Thou dost
dismiss Thy servant, O Lord, according to Thy word in peace: Because my
eyes have seen Thy salvation."

4. Permit me, my dear Jesus, to use Thy words in the Gospel: "I am come to
cast fire on the earth, and what will I but that it be kindled?"--Luke xii.
49. Why is it that I receive so often, and approach this fire of divine
love, and am not ignited? Let, then, this fire of love, which burns in
this Sacrament, communicate its flames to me, that I may rise from the
things of this world. I will now endeavor to love Thee above all things
and no creature shall hinder me from Thy love. I will love Thee with my
whole strength.

5. Dear Infant Jesus, Thy love has conquered my heart! I know now that
Thou givest Thyself to me as my food, and as a ransom to free me from the
slavery of Satan. My servitude to the devil, the flesh, and the world has
been hard, but being once liberated from these chains, I hate my former
cruel masters, and wish to belong entirely to Thee. There is no joy or
happiness in anything in this world, but in Thee, my God, Who callest to
me: "Come to Me all you that labor, and are burdened, and I will refresh
you. Take up My yoke upon you ... and you shall find rest to your
souls."--Matt. xi. 28, 29. Yes, I will willingly subject myself to Thy
yoke, by obedience to Thy holy commandments, which I will keep with the
greatest exactitude. Permit me to approach Thy sacred banquet, for which I
am now preparing.

6. In Jesus you may find all that you seek, and all that you need. Why,
then, do you turn to other consolations? Seek that only Good which
contains all good. Consider Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, the greatest
Good, and stir up in yourself a desire for Him. He will not despise you,
though you are unworthy of the favor. When Jesus dwelt on earth, and
travelled through cities, towns, and country, He always had compassion on
misery, and rejected none that came seeking relief from the ills of body
and soul. And now that same Jesus is in heaven, and He can refuse no one.
The woman who touched the hem of His garment was healed of a long standing
infirmity. Magdalen, the sinner, kisses His feet, and her sins are
forgiven. The pagan woman of Chanaan obtains the cure of her daughter. The
sisters Mary and Martha obtain the resurrection of their brother Lazarus.
Those possessed by the devil are freed.

My heart will not hesitate, but will boldly and humbly approach the Lord
and ask the cure of my soul. He gives me His sacred body and blood, and
all other needful things will be added unto me.

7. Yes, my God, my Lord, will come to me! I will not fear; I will approach
with a joyful heart; I will not lose courage because I am sinful, as I
know the Lord invites the sinner. He has eaten and drank with them, and
treated them as His friends. He will also eat with me, and entertain me at
His own table if I am only sorry for my sins. He will give me the kiss of
peace and welcome me to His house. With His own flesh and blood He will
feed me.

8. Come, O dear Jesus, wash my feet as Thou didst the apostles'. St. Peter
refused, but when he was told that unless he complied he would have no
part with Jesus, he gladly consented. Purify me also that I may have share
with Thee in Thy glory. I am full of impurities in body and soul, my lips
are unclean, because they utter many reprehensible words, my eyes and ears
are impure, because they see and hear impurities. Who can purify me but
Thou, O Lord, O crucified Redeemer, by Thy sacred blood which flows from
the cross?

9. Who shall give me the wings of a dove, that I may fly to Thee, my rest,
my peace? Give me two wings: one the firm confidence in Thy goodness, that
Thou wilt allow me to claim some of Thy merits for my salvation; the other
the wing of love, that I may soar beyond this world, and remain with Thee.
Prepare me for Thy sacred banquet with the virtues which Thou Thyself
would have in me. Teach me how I am to serve Thee. Give me a real thirst
after Thy sacred blood, and a real hunger after Thy sacred flesh, that I
may really desire it.

10. O consolation of my soul, dear Infant Jesus, I beg of Thee to root out
of my heart all the sins and vices to which I am so much inclined; spare
me not in removing them, even though it may hurt, even though I may be
unwilling. Piety, humility, sincerity, modesty, and love are necessary.
Then plant these virtues in my soul, and give me grace to practise them.

11. The Bridegroom is coming! I hear this cry, and I am to go forth to
meet Him. Am I prepared? Have I oil in my lamp? Bestir yourself then, O my
soul: it is not an angel that is coming, or a great prophet. No, it is God
Himself Who is approaching: the Son of God, the King of glory. Rise, my
soul, and prepare a resting-place in your heart, where the Lord may
remain.

After Communion.

Ejaculations To The Dear Infant Jesus.

How great is Thy love, sweet Heart of Jesus, Who hast given Thyself to me
as a celestial food! Thou deservest to be loved with an infinite love, and
not with the love of ordinary creatures.

O Jesus, I am heartily sorry for having hitherto loved Thee so little! Why
did I not love Thee sooner?

Would that I could redeem that time in which I did not love Thee! Where
will I find hearts that are going to help me to make up for the glory that
I should have given Thee up to this time?

Would that I loved Thee with that tender love with which Mary loved Thee.
The angels and saints loved Thee, my Jesus; let me also join them in their
love.

Offering.

I offer Thee my whole being; let it be unreservedly Thine. Thou hast taken
possession of my heart, Thou art its Master; my whole life shall be used
for Thy greater honor and glory. Wherever my influence may reach, there
will I carry the name of Jesus. Wherever the word of God may be announced,
I will glory in Thy name.

Thou, O Lord, art so full of love, and still Thou art so little loved! O
would that I could enkindle all hearts with the fire of Thy love! Thou, O
Lord, art the Master of all hearts; we belong to Thee because Thou hast
created us, and when we rebelled from Thee and became slaves of Satan,
Thou didst redeem us. What greater right have we than to belong to Thee,
to be subject to Thee, and to announce Thy holy name to all, so that by
our mutual example we may be encouraged to live lives of sanctity?

O that all of us would have the love of the Infant Jesus in our souls, and
make earnest endeavors to spread Thy love among all men! When, O Lord,
will I be dissolved, to live only with Thee? To Thee my sighs and desires
go up day and night. When will I see Thy blessed countenance? When my time
comes to die, let me die in Thy love, so that I may love Thee for all
eternity. Thy will, O Jesus, be done in all things, and let me delight to
walk in Thy footsteps.

Do with me what Thou wilt; I am willing to submit to joy or sorrow, life
or death, fortune or misfortune. It is all indifferent to me as long as it
is Thy will, only give me the grace to endure adversity with resignation.
It will be a joy to me to fulfil Thy holy will in all things.

Thanksgiving After Communion.

_Adoration of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, according to St. Francis de
Sales._

How can I, O Lord Jesus Christ, praise Thee sufficiently for having
visited my soul in Thy infinite goodness, by Thy divinity and Thy sacred
humanity, with Thy body and blood? I give Thee, my Lord and my God, a
loving welcome, Thou Who art my Redeemer, my last end, my consolation, my
sweetest rest, my all. A thousand welcomes to Thee, my dear Jesus, my good
shepherd. In the abyss of my nothingness I humbly adore Thee. I adore Thy
sacred flesh and blood, which Thou hast given me for my food, and the
pledge of my eternal union with Thee. I adore Thy sacred head crowned with
thorns; I adore Thy eyes that have shed so many tears for me; I adore Thy
mouth, with which Thou didst teach me eternal truths; I adore Thy sacred
countenance, which has been beaten for me by cruel soldiers; Thy feet,
that have been pierced by the nails and fixed to the tree of the cross;
Thy arms, which were outstretched for me, for a loving embrace; Thy side
which the lance pierced, and from which blood and water issued forth, the
witnesses of my redemption; Thy Heart, which loved me even unto the death
of the cross. My dear Redeemer, I adore Thy sacred body, covered with
innumerable wounds which Thou didst suffer for me. I adore Thy most holy
soul, which was saddened unto death in the Garden of Olives that I might
reach eternal life.

My dear Jesus, with great love I embrace Thee, and I will remain faithful
to Thee until my last hour. Bless these feelings of a good heart: grant
that no storm of temptation may lead me again to be unfaithful as I have
repeatedly been heretofore.

A Pious Salutation To The Infant Jesus.

Hail, holy and adorable Infant Jesus, source of mercy! Thou art the life
of the sinner, unfathomable ocean of divine sweetness, our hope, our joy.
To Thee, born in the dreary stable of Bethlehem, we cry, poor children of
Eve, to Thee we send forth our sighs, to Thee we send up our lamentations
in this valley of tears. Turn then, O incarnate love, Thine eyes of mercy
towards us, O blessed fruit of Thy Virgin Mother. As Thou didst show
Thyself full of kindness in the stable of Bethlehem, so show unto us,
after this miserable life, Thy divine mercy, when Thou shalt come in the
glory of Thy Father. O sweet, O loving, O clement Infant Jesus! Amen.

Pious Invocation To The Infant Jesus.

(_Father Elias Avillon._)

Hail, Infant Jesus, Thou fountain of mercy, Thou life of the sinner dead
in sin, Thou unfathomable ocean of divine consolation, our hope and our
joy. Hail, to Thee, born in the desolate stable of Bethlehem, do we cry,
poor children of Eve. To Thee do we sigh and bewail our misery from this
valley of tears. Turn then, O incarnate love of God, Thine eyes of mercy
upon us, Thou blessed fruit of the womb of the Virgin Mary. As Thou didst
show poor humanity unbounded mercy from the manger, so also continue Thy
kindness during our life, until after this miserable existence we arrive
in the glory of heaven, where we shall meet Thee, to praise and glorify
Thee for all eternity. O sweet, O pious, O merciful Infant Jesus! Amen.

A Prayer To The Holy Name Of Jesus.

Eternal God, Father in heaven, daily do we pray that Thy sacred name be
sanctified, that Thy kingdom come and Thy will be done. It is also Thy
holy will that the name of Thy beloved Son should be glorified. Thou hast
given Him a name at which every knee should bend in heaven, on earth, and
under the earth. I pray Thee with all my heart that Thou give us the grace
to pronounce that holy name with the greatest devotion, and to serve the
Lord with a good and willing heart. Engrave this holy name on my heart,
that I may never forget it. Place it as a sign on my forehead, that I may
ever be faithful to it. O holy name of Jesus! my heart rejoices when I
hear thee mentioned. I feel great consolation as often as I hear that holy
name. Angels of heaven, who are gathered in ecstasy about the throne of
God, praise with us on earth the sacred name of Jesus; sing its praises
worthily, as we cannot sing it; invoke it for us also, that when our
feeble powers fail, thy holiness and zeal will supply our deficiency. Thy
holy name, O Jesus, be praised forever!

Adoration of the Child Jesus in the Twelve Mysteries of His Divine
Infancy.

Dear Jesus, divine Infant of incomparable beauty, of infinite goodness, I
adore Thee, because Thou art my Redeemer, and I love Thee. I make a
sacrifice to Thee of all my intellect, and of my heart, and I thank Thee
for having become a child for my sake. I adore Thee in all the mysteries
of Thy holy childhood, and pray Thee to let me enter into the spirit of
it. Give me the grace to honor Thy childhood all my life, and that I may
imitate the virtues which Thou dost inculcate by Thy example.

I adore Thee, O God of purity, at the moment when the Holy Ghost formed
Thy sacred body in the bosom of the Virgin Mary, and beg of Thee the grace
to be always pure.

I adore Thee, O hidden God, hidden for nine months in the womb of the
Blessed Virgin, and I desire to honor Thee by my perfect life.

I adore Thee, O Child of grace, in Thy visitation to John the Baptist in
order to sanctify him. Visit also my soul, that I may live a saintly life
and remain faithful to the impulses of Thy grace.

I adore Thee, O Child Jesus, at the moment of Thy birth, and I desire,
with Thy help, that no other fire burn in my heart than that which Thou
camest on this earth to kindle.

I adore Thee, O Spouse covered with wounds, in the painful mystery of the
circumcision. I conjure Thee by the sacred blood which Thou didst then
shed for the first time for our salvation, that Thou wilt give me the
virtue of meekness, with which I am to go through life, for Thy glory and
the edification of my neighbor.

I adore Thee, O Lord Jesus, with the Magi, who came from the distant
orient to adore Thee lying in the crib in the stable. Give me the grace to
be in earnest in the work of my salvation.

Great God, Author of all sanctity, I adore Thee in the Temple, where Thou
didst present Thyself according to the Law of Moses, to be offered to Thy
Father as His first-born Son. Give me grace to subject myself to every
law, even though it would imply that I am a sinner, which I really am.

I adore Thee, humble Jesus, in Thy flight into Egypt, and beg of Thee to
give me the grace, by this holy mystery of Thy life, of perfect humility
of heart.

I adore Thee, O Child Jesus, in Thy poverty, which afflicted Thee in Thy
stay in Egypt. Give me the grace also to be poor in spirit, and endure
actual poverty with resignation.

I adore Thee, O Child Jesus, in Thy joyful and triumphal return from Thy
exile in Egypt to Nazareth; give me the grace to overcome the enemies of
my salvation.

I adore Thee, O obedient Child Jesus, in Thy exact compliance with the
commands of Mary and Joseph; give me the grace joyfully to obey my
superiors.

I adore Thee, O Child Jesus, in the midst of the doctors in the Temple of
Jerusalem, when Thou didst enlighten their minds on the sacred prophecies
of the Old Testament. Give me a Christian simplicity, that I may believe
all that Thou teachest me through the holy Catholic Church.





FEBRUARY. THE HOLY FAMILY.


What a beautiful sight is the Holy Family dwelling on earth! God could not
create anything more beautiful than this Holy Family; He reached the limit
of possibilities in creation when He had accomplished this. It is indeed a
great example to us, and a model which we ought to hold before our eyes
during this month, in order that we may study the foundations of what a
holy family ought to be; what a life that should be, where the holiest are
bound together in ties of most affectionate friendship and relationship.

Our Holy Father Leo XIII. has seen the great importance of the Christian
family: the family established by the laws of the Church and the country,
where marriages are legalized and solemnized; where continence and modesty
reign; where children, under kind and parental subjection, are brought up
to be good men and women, good for religion and for society. When poverty
strikes such a family there is patience and forbearance shown; when
sickness and death come, there is resignation to the will of God. In the
Christian home there is surpassing peace, and not that crazy restlessness
that looks for satisfaction in grasping at possessions, never satisfied
day nor night.

I do not think that this devotion has been appointed for this month by any
authority, except the idea that after having adored the divine infancy
during the month of January, the devotion to the Holy Family may follow as
a natural sequence. Should any one desire to make this devotion during
another month, it would certainly not be out of the way, for save only in
a few cases has a certain devotion been assigned to a particular time. The
devotion to the Holy Family is a beautiful and instructive one; the
Christian family should be built on this great model. The Holy Family
consisted of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph; the father, Mother, and Child. All
other families are made up of the same constituents.

Those who are actually in a family, or who intend to choose that mode of
life by which they may get to heaven, will love this devotion and find
instruction and consolation in it.

One of the greatest works of God in this world is the Holy Family at
Bethlehem and Nazareth. He sent down upon the earth His only Son, Jesus
Christ; prepared a most holy Mother for Him, Mary immaculate, and selected
for Him a foster-father and a protector. He held them together in the most
tender family ties of father, Mother, and Child. He kept them in that
relation until St. Joseph died a blessed death, and the Lord Jesus went
forth on His sacred mission of teaching and redeeming mankind.

What a beautiful sight to us poor human beings! what a glory to God was
that Holy Family, dwelling in the humble abode of Nazareth! We find here
the model on which we shall reflect for this month of February. We will
consecrate this month to praising God with the members of the Holy Family;
we will study the ways by which they were so pleasing to God, and we will
draw from these considerations many valuable lessons for our own conduct.

Our Holy Father, Pope Leo XIII., with an ever-watchful eye to the
necessities of our time, has seen the importance of a devotion to the Holy
Family, and has recommended it to the faithful, and with his own authority
established a sodality of the Holy Family; he has invested it with many
indulgences in order to encourage the faithful in taking the Holy Family
as their model. Here is, then, a practical way to teach ourselves the way
of salvation by the example of others.

It is therefore a most useful practice of piety to become members of the
sodality of the Holy Family; you will then place yourselves under its
special protection, and choose Jesus, Mary, and Joseph for your particular
advocates before God. Look upon the members of the Holy Family as the most
perfect models for imitation, whose examples will teach you what to
correct and what to avoid, what to do for your temporal and eternal
welfare, and that of your families.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


In an apostolic brief of June 14, 1892, the Holy Father, Pope Leo XIII.,
demonstrates how the welfare of the family and of the State depends
chiefly on education, and that it is of the utmost importance that a
religious spirit be fostered in the Christian family. From the first
family, God so arranged the method and order of such a life as to exhibit
to the world a form of a divinely ordered association, in which all human
beings might behold a most complete model of family life, and of all
virtue and holiness. The devotion to the Holy Family, a holy and a
powerful institution before God and man, has increased very much within a
few years, and it is worth our while to think of this on the first day of
our monthly devotion, and appreciate it as we ought.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, Who didst hallow by Thy surpassing virtues, and the
example of Thy home life, the household Thou didst choose to live in
whilst on earth, mercifully look down upon this family, whose members,
humbly prostrate before Thee, implore Thy protection. Remember that we are
Thine, bound and consecrated to Thee by a special devotion. Protect us in
Thy mercy, deliver us from danger, help us in our necessities, and impart
to us strength to persevere always in the imitation of Thy Holy Family, so
that, by serving Thee and loving Thee faithfully during this mortal life,
we may at length give Thee eternal praise in heaven. O Mary, dearest
Mother, we implore thy assistance, knowing that thy divine Son will
hearken to thy petitions; and do thou, most glorious patriarch St. Joseph,
help us with thy powerful patronage, and place our petitions in Mary's
hands that she may offer them to Jesus Christ. Amen.



Second Day.


Within our own time the devotion to the Holy Family has grown under the
fostering care of the Supreme Pontiff, who has authorized the
establishment of associations throughout the world, by which men and
women, married and unmarried, are gathered into one fold from the
standpoint of the family. The Holy Father desires that all the faithful of
the Catholic Church should consider this association as a consecration to
the Christian life, and that they will feel that they are bound to lead a
holy life because their association is established and legalized by God.
For what is the Sacrament of Matrimony but the legalizing of the family
before God and man? Let us consider the family as a special institution of
God's providence for the preservation of the world, and the propagating in
it of sound principles of learning and religion.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Third Day.


We are to consecrate ourselves to God under the union of a family. That is
the pretence with which we come before God, to claim His kindness and
mercy because we belong to a family. We are not isolated creatures,
looking for our selfish ends, but we are a union of individuals
constituted under a certain authority, which gives us a claim to the
respect of God and man; for God has said, "Where there are two or three
gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them."--Matt.
xviii. 20. The formula of consecration of a Christian family has been
given us by the Sovereign Pontiff himself; rules, regulations, and by-laws
have been given to this society under the same authority of the Holy
Father. The whole Christian family should be so united among themselves,
that there be but one family under one head, set over all to rule them by
its supreme power. We belong to this Christian family of the Church; let
us then unite for the common good of all.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


The scope of the pious association of the Holy Family is that all
Christian families be consecrated to the Holy Family of Nazareth, placing
it before themselves for veneration and imitation; offering up every day
before its image prayers in its honor, and practising in their lives the
sublime virtues which the Holy Family offered for imitation to every grade
of society. The rich will find a model before them, the learned and highly
educated will know exactly what to do according to the dignity of their
position, the working class, especially, will find here the guidance and
friendship needed in their temptations and troubles. The Holy Family is a
poor, working, humble family, as poor as the poorest, as laborious as the
most hard-working, as humble as the most lowly.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


The picture of the Holy Family should be in every household; it is a
perpetual reminder, placed in tangible form, of our dear Lord, our blessed
Lady, and our friend, St. Joseph, who were the members of the Holy Family.
We often are interested in the pictures of great persons, and take delight
in representations of angels and holy people. What is the secret of this
inclination? Why, we can see those whom we wish to imitate, and grow to
know their good and holy lives through their pictures. The Holy Father has
approved one special picture which is to be the emblem of this
association: Mary and Joseph, holding the youth Jesus between them by the
hand. Jesus is not an infant, for this picture is to bring to mind the
fact that His parents had to suffer care and anxiety in order to bring Him
to this stage of boyhood, for which noble duty they were fitted by special
providence and by special faithfulness.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Sixth Day.


"We have good hopes," says the Holy Father, concluding his encyclical
letter, "that all to whom the salvation of souls is committed, especially
the bishops, will make themselves partners and sharers of our zeal in
promoting this pious association. For those who recognize and deplore with
us the change and corruption of Christian morals, the extinction of the
love of religion and piety in families, and the passion for earthly goods,
enkindled beyond measure, will desire exceedingly to apply suitable
remedies for so many grievous evils. Since nothing can be more salutary
and efficacious for Christian families than the example of the Holy
Family, let care be taken that as many families as possible, especially
those of the working classes, against which insidious forces are more
strongly exercised, enroll themselves in this association. Let the
association be on its guard, lest it swerve from its purpose, or change
its spirit--rather let the practices of piety and the prayers which have
been determined on to be preserved intact. May Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,
thus besought within the family circle, be graciously present! May they
foster charity, regulate morals, incite all that imitate them to virtue,
and alleviate and render more bearable the hardships which oppress
mankind!"

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


A plenary indulgence after a sincere confession and a worthy communion,
and praying for the intentions of His Holiness, may be gained by the
members of the association on the following days: First, on the day of
their entrance into the association, after they have recited the act of
consecration. Second, on the day of a general meeting, when all go to
communion in a body, and renew their promises. Third, on the feasts of the
Nativity (Christmas), the Circumcision, Epiphany, Easter and Ascension.
Fourth, on the feasts of the Blessed Virgin: Immaculate Conception,
Nativity, Annunciation, Purification, Assumption. Fifth, also on the
following days: feast of St. Joseph in March, Patronage of St. Joseph,
Third Sunday after Easter, Espousal of the Blessed Virgin on the twenty-
third of January. Sixth, on the feast of the Holy Family, and Seventh, at
the hour of death.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Eighth Day.


Partial indulgences may be gained when visiting a church where the
association is established, provided the members pray for the prosperity
of Christendom, and for the intention of the Holy Father. Seven years and
seven quarantines may be gained on the feasts of the Visitation,
Presentation, and the Patronage of the Blessed Virgin. The same
indulgences may be gained by the family in the reunion in prayer among
themselves, if they pray before a picture of the Holy Family. The same
also, whenever the members attend a public meeting of the association.
Three hundred days' indulgence is granted as often as a member of the
association recites, before a picture of the Holy Family, the prayer "O
most loving Jesus," etc., etc. The members may gain an indulgence of two
hundred days when they make the salutation: "Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,
enlighten us, aid us, save us. Amen." One hundred days for every new
member that is brought to the association, and sixty days for every good
work done in honor of the Holy Family. All these indulgences are
applicable to the souls in purgatory.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Ninth Day.


The Catholic Christian has the true faith which comes to him from Jesus
Christ, the Founder of the true Church. He ought, then, to show by his
conduct that his faith has made him better than so many others, who have
not had the graces and advantages which came to him. In other words, it is
not enough to believe the truths that God has revealed; it is not enough
to belong to the true Church by the internal adhesion of the mind; it is
indispensably necessary to manifest our faith in exterior works. Our faith
should so have penetrated our whole being, that the profession of religion
should show itself in all our actions. Faith without works is dead, and at
the Last Judgment the almighty Judge will demand of us an account of all
our actions, and then will He render to every one the merited reward or
punishment. Let it be our aim in life to fill the days of our stay on
earth with many good actions, the outcome of our faith, so that when we
stand before the throne of God, we may have many glorious deeds to our
credit.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Tenth Day.


A Christian considers his faith as a gift of heaven, a priceless treasure
far surpassing any earthly wealth, because it raises man to a true
knowledge of God and secures for him his eternal salvation. He rejects
with horror the maxims of our modern infidels, who say, "One religion is
as good as another"; "Hell is only a bugbear"; "The faith of the heart is
enough for salvation," and many others of the same nature. He rejects them
because he knows that God is one, that the truth that comes from God is
one, and that therefore faith must be one, and religion one. He knows that
religion cannot be framed according to the whims of man, but only can come
from the authority of God in His holy revelation. He will not associate
with those who hold the above false doctrines; he will be an enemy of bad
books, which teach errors of faith and which drag those who read them into
the mire of immorality, and he will caution his friends against them.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Eleventh Day.


The Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ as a perfect society, with
authority to make laws, with power to punish the guilty, and to expel
rebellious subjects from her midst. This power was given to the Church by
Christ when He said, "And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall
be bound also in heaven." It is clear that Christ intended His Church to
be our guide in all our actions, as an authority to teach us what the
revelation is concerning our future state. We should, therefore, be
obedient and faithful children of the Church. We should be grateful to
God, Who in His mercy has established certain fountains of grace, which
are found in the Church, and are guarded by her. These fountains of grace
are the sacraments, which point out the holy states of life, and the true
manner of pleasing God. We should use the Sacraments of Penance and Holy
Eucharist for the remedy of our faults, and the strength of our weakness.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twelfth Day.


Confession is the correction of our faults, and if we have sinned let us
remember we have an advocate in heaven, to Whom we wish to return in the
sincerity of our hearts. The Holy Eucharist is the body and blood of
Christ and communion the partaking of it.

We should not, therefore, be deterred from frequenting these sacraments by
human considerations, or by the mockery of the people of this world. We
should have these words of Christ deeply engraven in our hearts: "Except
you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you shall not
have life in you."--John vi. 54. A devout Catholic is easily distinguished
from the crowd of careless ones, when we see him humbly and frequently
going to confession and to holy communion.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Thirteenth Day.


Be also reverent and devout in the house of God; not brought there by vain
curiosity, or by fashion, but by unfeigned piety, rendering to God an
external tribute of dependence and adoration. Look upon priests as the
ambassadors of God, treat them with respect, listen to their teaching, and
put it into practice. Reverence the bishops as divinely constituted
guardians and teachers in the Church: especially the see of St. Peter, the
Vicar of Christ, the Roman Pontiff, the Father and teacher, in whom is
intrusted the plentitude of power to rule the whole Catholic family.
Reverence the infallible authority of the Pope, which guides you in
matters of faith, in form of worship, and morality.

Accept with docility and obedience the decisions of the Holy See, and
conform to them your opinions and thoughts. Do not follow the changeable
and novel opinions of our infidel age.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Fourteenth Day.


The true Christian must not only profess the faith, but also the laws of
Christ. He is anxious to observe them exactly and to observe them all,
knowing that he is guilty of damnation who violates the law in one
important point. This law bids us to love all men as fellow creatures, to
love our relatives, our country, but above all, and before all, we must
love God, the Author of our being, the great loving Father of heaven. The
honor of God is the very first duty of man, who as a rational being knows
God and His infinite goodness; we wish to serve Him as His subjects,
render Him the homage due to His immensity, a worship which our infinite
littleness renders to God. Never profane the word of God yourself, and
prevent curses and oaths in others as far as possible. By acts of praise
and benediction let us repair the offences against God when we cannot
prevent them. At least pray for those who use the name of God in vain, and
thus endeavor to ward off from them the eternal punishment due to that
wicked practice.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Fifteenth Day.


Contribute your share towards the glorification of the name of God, by
observing the Sundays and festivals of the Church. God has expressly
reserved these days to Himself, and has pointed them out by the authority
of the Church. In the Old and in the New Law, God has had days of rest and
of religious practices; and for the observances of these He has promised
publicly that there should be many rewards. Every good, God-fearing man
will give a just tribute of respect to God, because God wills it, and
because he is looking for some benefit from God. Abstain then from servile
works on those days, no matter what temporal gains may be expected, and be
careful that others, too, keep holy the Sabbath of the Lord, particularly
those who are intrusted to your care and command. Do not have work done on
Sunday, and allow none to be done about your premises.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Sixteenth Day.


Respect your parents, superiors, and masters, and all those who hold
positions of trust towards you. They hold the authority of God, and he who
despises them despises God Himself. Honor and respect those superiors as
representatives of God, and obey them in all things that are not against
His law; and so we come to that great second commandment, which is like
unto the first: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." We should do
unto others as we would wish that others should do unto us; that is, we
should look upon one another as children of one great family, of which God
is the heavenly Father. "By this shall all men know that you are My
disciples, if you have love one for another," not showing this love
through politeness only, but through a real, downright feeling of interest
in others, and without a selfish regard of our own interests. Try to
perform spiritual and corporal works of mercy for your neighbor.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Seventeenth Day.


In all your intercourse with others respect their persons and property; do
not look for unjust gains; be faithful to your bargains and contracts;
never look to your own selfish interests solely. Never speak ill of
anybody, nor circulate detractions, nor reveal secrets and defects that
might lessen the esteem in which any one is held; excuse the faults of
others, and find some excuse for the intention with which even an evil
action is committed. We are all temples of the Holy Ghost, sanctified and
ennobled by the blood of Christ. We are the dwellings of the Holy Trinity,
called to a heavenly inheritance. Do not desecrate this sacred temple by
impurity; guard against impure thoughts and immodest desires, flee from
dangerous occasions. Avoid foolishly pursuing the luxuries and vanities of
the world, improper company, and bad conversation. Do not enter theatres
or places of amusement where your morals are endangered, and from which
you carry nothing but pictures of immoral objects. Arm yourself most
effectually against the approach of evil by the powerful shield of prayer,
and walk in the presence of God.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Eighteenth Day.


So far we have considered the law of God practically interpreted in our
every-day life; let us go still further and endeavor to learn the laws of
the Church, for the Lord has said: "He that heareth you, heareth Me; and
he that despiseth you despiseth Me," and "If he will not hear the Church
let him be to thee as the heathen and publican." On Sundays and holydays
of obligation, we ought to hear Mass. We should observe the feasts of the
Church and the restriction from flesh meat on Fridays and other days of
abstinence. Remember that these little acts of mortification are a great
benefit to us, since the Lord has commanded, "That we should bring forth
fruits worthy of penance." Make your Easter duty, for the Church has laid
down the law that you should fulfil those duties, not from routine or
human respect, but with the knowledge of the needs of your soul.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Nineteenth Day.


What an exalted opinion we should have of Christian piety! It inspires the
Christian man and woman with lofty ideas, and prepares them for noble
undertakings. These lessons of piety should be planted early in the hearts
of the young, that they may take root and grow up to a magnificent fruit
of mature virtue. Serve God as a loving and dutiful child, cherish a great
devotion to the Blessed Virgin, and have recourse to her in all your
wants, being sure that all your petitions will meet with a ready and
hearty response. Never forget these three truths, which should be the main
considerations of the true Christian on every occasion: First, That sin is
the only evil which should be feared; Second, The grace of God is the real
good for which we should strive with all our heart; Third, The salvation
of the soul is the all-important business of our lives, for which we were
created, and which should be looked after with that care which it
deserves.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twentieth Day.


The husband, as head of the family, owes to his wife fidelity, love, and
support. Fidelity is that constancy of affection which he has promised at
his marriage, and which must be preserved inviolable until death; it means
that purity of soul and body which will not permit itself to be degraded
by impurity and adultery. Conjugal fidelity is a great and holy duty, in
which matrimony is held sacred. There you find peace, happiness, and the
blessing of almighty God. Our Lord was very stringent upon this point, for
He says: "Whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already
committed adultery with her in his heart."--Matt. v. 28. Whosoever then
commits adultery transgresses a most important divine commandment. In the
Old Law this crime was punished by stoning the guilty person to death, and
in the primitive Church by a severe public penance of many years'
duration. What fidelity does not the husband demand of the wife! With the
same strictness is he obliged to be faithful to her whom he has chosen as
his life companion.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-first Day.


The second duty of the husband and wife is conjugal love. The word
conjugal means joined together, because husband and wife are united to
bear the same burden. The Apostle says: "Husbands, love your wives, as
Christ also loved the Church, and delivered Himself up for it."--Ephes. v.
25. Husband and wife are individuals whom God has joined in inseparable
companionship. The greatest bond between mankind, and the sweetest one, is
conjugal love, of which we are thinking on this day consecrated to the
Holy Family. Keep this great duty before your eyes and never forget it,
for it is easily destroyed. It is from that love, too, that should spring
your children, who are to grow up to take your place in the Church and the
State. These children you are to bring up in the fear and love of God,
faithful to the Church and their fatherland. A tremendous responsibility!

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-second Day.


The husband is the main worker in the family, so that his duty is to
provide for his family by his industry and economy. He must look for
employment and strive to keep it, so as to have a never-failing source of
income, by which his people may live in comparative comfort. There are
husbands who will allow their wives and children to work, while they
themselves live idle lives, which is the fashion of the untutored Indian.
Not only must the husband work, but he must live in economy, and not throw
his money away foolishly in gaming or in drunkenness. The most frequent
cause of a husband and father's failure to provide for his family is
drunkenness. Drunkenness causes woe, sin, sorrow and shame. Drunkenness
besots the mind, and makes of an intelligent being a brute in his
passions, and a fool in his actions; it extinguishes the spirit of God in
him, all sentiments of religion are lost, the Church of God is despised
and disgraced. Drunkenness does as much harm as the greatest vices,
bringing ruin with it whenever indulged in.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-third Day.


The husband has to share the care of the children and he should look after
the instruction of the child. Children are a great treasure, worth more
than all the wealth of the world. The Lord said of them to the apostles:
"Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for of
such is the kingdom of God." And why is the Lord so anxious for the
welfare of the innocent child? Because it is a weak human being, unable to
help itself, destined for heaven, redeemed by the blood of Jesus, and a
temple of the Holy Ghost, more fitted to be such on account of the purity
of its soul. Now the care of this child is given to the father and the
mother, under whose care it is to grow up a true Christian, an exemplary
member of the Church of God; to live on until it has fulfilled its days
and the duties of its state of life, when, like yourself, having come to
the fulness of maturity, it is gathered in to render an account of its
life work to almighty God. The success of the child's life depends chiefly
on the manner in which its parents fulfil their duty.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-fourth Day.


In what special duties are you to instruct your children? First of all,
let the young children learn early to pray, make them think of God, speak
to them of His love for mankind, teach them to adore Him, because He has
created them, to thank Him for all His benefits which flow to them so
abundantly, to ask Him with confidence for all the graces that they need.
Correct the children for their faults: Lying, stealing, cursing,
stubbornness, disobedience, fighting, and cruelty. Have an eye very early
on their morals, for little children learn to do wicked things, by which
they lose the love and grace of God. Be not a tyrant, but a sensible,
religious father or mother, and see to it that the children are free from
these vices. Give them no bad example, especially by using profanity, or
by getting intoxicated. All this presupposes perpetual vigilance; remember
you will have to render a strict account of these things before God.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-fifth Day.


Having considered the husband's duties, we must now look at the duty of a
wife. The Scriptures say of the wife: "A good wife is a good portion; she
shall be given in the portion of them that fear God, to a man for his good
deeds."--Eccles. xxvi. 3. There is nothing in the whole world more precious
than a good wife. "A wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish will
pull down with her hands that also which is built."--Prov. xiv. 1. A wife
must love her husband, and she owes him the most scrupulous fidelity; if
the first duty of the husband is to love his wife, so also is there a
corresponding duty to return that love. She must be patient with him when
he comes home murmuring against his fate; she must make the home agreeable
to him by cleanliness and cheerfulness. She must bear the burdens of this
life with her husband, and encourage him, that he may not be despondent.
The wife must be sober, not given to scolding and fault-finding. "Let
women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord; because the husband is
the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church."--Ephes. v. 22.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-sixth Day.


The conscientious observance of the marriage vows is to be a supreme law
to the wife. Purity must be the virtue principally looked to in marriage,
according to the laws of the Sacrament of Matrimony; the wife's motto must
be that of Susanna of old, who said: "I will rather die than sin before
God." The wife owes her husband a compliance at least to his wishes; not
exactly an abject obedience, but that the husband and wife consult with
each other, and that she comply in all lawful and sensible things. This
subjection is founded on the Scriptures. God Himself said to Eve, "Thou
shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee"
(Gen. iii. 16), and St. Paul declares, "Let women be subject to their
husbands as to the Lord."--Ephes. v. 22. The loving, true, and obedient
wife exerts an unbounded influence for good over her husband. She will
make him great in the eyes of men, she will make him respectable and
presentable in society; in short, she will make the married life a truly
happy one from beginning to end.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-seventh Day.


The wife has a sublime calling to be a mother. What is more beautiful than
motherhood? what is more useful to the new-born humanity than the mother?
All the world recognizes her dignity, and respects her. A Christian mother
will consider the child a gift from God, which though given to her, still
belongs to God; hers is the first care of the newly-born infant, her care
and love will not relax for all time to come. She is always the mother.
Have the child presented for Baptism at the very earliest moment; if it be
in danger of death see that it receives private baptism. Then start out in
patience and kindness to rear it, giving it a secular but above all a
religious training, as the child must be prepared to take its place as a
good member of society and of the Church. Hence prayers must be taught,
and care must be taken that they are recited with piety and regularity;
the dogmas of the Church must be impressed on the child. At home it has to
learn all that pertains to the spiritual life of the holy Roman Catholic
Church, of which it is a member. Secular learning must be imparted, too,
as much as possible in schools belonging to the Church, so that the very
best education may be secured for the child.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-eighth Day.


The mother must watch over the children, and be very careful of the
company they keep. She must see that prayers are said morning and night,
before and after meals, that they go regularly to church on Sundays, and
to school every day. When they are able to go to work, give them an
occupation so that they will not be idle. Keep a vigilant eye on your
grown-up sons and daughters. They are forming acquaintances which perhaps
are not good for them; their associations may not be the best.
Unrestricted, unobserved meetings should not be allowed, for they excite
the passions. When the time of their marriage comes, pray to almighty God
that they may find such partners as will be a help to them for the rest of
their lives, and lead them on in sanctity to their eternal salvation. As
you have been a good mother to your children, they will respect your
memory, will pray for you when you are gone, and will imitate your
virtues. The memory of a good mother lives forever.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-ninth Day.


The principal feast during the month of February is the feast of the
Purification of the Blessed Virgin, or Candlemas. On that day Mary goes to
the Temple, because the days of her purification are over. For forty days
she was excluded from the Temple as being impure. Mary, as we know, was
holy and good, and did not need to subject herself to the Law of Moses;
but she was obedient and permitted herself to be regarded as an ordinary
woman. There in the Temple she presented her first-born Son to God. He
belongs to God already, He is God; He is the victim by whose atonement a
permanent reconciliation is effected between God and man. The gates of
heaven are opened, and the places made vacant by the fall of the angels
are to be filled. Mary brings with her the offering of the poor, a pair of
turtle-doves as a ransom. God has accepted the sacrifice of His divine
Son, made for Him by His holy Mother. O holy Virgin! do thou also make
propitiation to the Father for us poor sinners, that we may be acceptable
to God, may belong to God, and may spend our lives in His service.

Prayer.

O most loving Jesus, etc., etc.

Amen.




Memorare To Mary.


Remember, O most loving Virgin Mary! that no one ever had recourse to thy
protection, implored thy aid, or sought thy mediation without obtaining
relief. Confiding, therefore, in thy goodness and mercy, we cast ourselves
at thy sacred feet, and do most humbly supplicate thee, O Mother of the
Eternal Word! to adopt us as thy children and to take upon thyself the
care of our salvation. O let it not be said, our dearest Mother, that we
have perished, where no one ever found but mercy, grace, and salvation.
Amen.




Form Of Renewing The Baptismal Vows.


Humbly prostrate before Thee, O my God! and before the Holy Family, Jesus,
Mary, and Joseph, I return my grateful thanks for the inestimable benefit
bestowed upon me, of being born and educated in the Catholic Church, of
which I was made a child by Baptism. I thus received a right to the graces
which Jesus Christ dispenses through the sacraments, the happiness of
being admitted into the number of the children of the true faith, and the
hope of one day entering paradise. I come to renew and ratify the promises
made at my Baptism. Yes, O my God! I desire to belong entirely to Thee, to
serve Thee all my life, and strive always for the end for which I was
created. Therefore I renounce Satan and all his works, sin and its
occasions. I renounce the world, its maxims and vanities. I renounce the
flesh and its concupiscences, all irregular desires, and whatever may be
displeasing to Thee. I renounce human respect, which for so long kept me
from Thee. Formerly I feared the world and its ridicule, now I have but
one fear, that of forgetting my religious duties. I will henceforth
faithfully perform them, I will live according to the precepts and maxims
of Jesus Christ, I will be a good Christian. O Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
make me more and more worthy of the name. Through the help of your
powerful protection, may I be a respectful child of God, submissive to the
Church, faithful to my duties, that I may one day have the happiness of
thanking and glorifying you in the heavenly country. I am resolved to live
according to the precepts and maxims of Jesus Christ; yes, I desire to
live a good Christian life, that I may die the death of the elect. I
promise to remain faithful to my obligations as an associate of the Holy
Family, and hope to persevere until death. And at that moment what
happiness it will be for me to pass from the arms of Jesus, Mary, and
Joseph on earth, to the arms of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in heaven,
for all eternity. This is my hope. Amen.

An indulgence of forty days.




Act Of Consecration.


O Jesus, Mary, Joseph, I, N. N., in sight of the whole celestial court,
choose you this day for my patrons and protectors. I offer, and solemnly
consecrate to you in this association, my body and soul, all I have and
all I am. I promise to live as a good Christian, that I may die the death
of the predestined. What happiness for me to pass one day from the arms of
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph on earth, to the arms of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost in heaven, for all eternity. This is my hope. Amen.





MARCH. ST. JOSEPH.


We can easily imagine that the foster-father of the Infant Jesus must have
been a great man in the eyes of God. His duties were very important; they
called for such a self-sacrificing character. We wish to imitate his
virtues this month; we wish to praise almighty God for all the
distinctions which He has showered upon St. Joseph; we want to belong to
St. Joseph, to be associated with him in heaven, and even now while we are
still on earth, for prayer associates us here with those whom we address
above. The saints hear our prayers by God's favor, and they reply at once.
We need many things, and so we are going to pray to St. Joseph, especially
during this month, for whatever we want. Go confidently and make out a
list of your necessities, write them down, and look over them occasionally
to see whether your petitions have been granted.

St. Joseph is all-powerful before God; whatever we ask of him we are sure
to obtain; this has been the experience of many good Christians; it will
also be your experience if you sincerely try it.

St. Joseph sanctified labor, poverty, and privations, by bearing them with
patience, humility, and resignation to the will of God. We have many
trials in life to endure, we have need of these virtues; let us look to it
that we acquire them for our own spiritual comfort. Let us bear with
patience all these trials; patience makes things bearable, for without
this virtue we would sink in despair.

The feast of St. Joseph is celebrated on the nineteenth of March, and for
this reason the month of March is dedicated to honor, venerate, and pray
to this great friend of God. The Church has in various ways encouraged
this devotion. Her devout children have taken it up, so that we find the
month of March as much dedicated to St. Joseph as the month of May to the
Blessed Virgin. Catholics hold St. Joseph in high veneration, and
deservedly so, as we will see in the following meditations on his life.
They have great confidence in his power before God, they know that he is a
great saint, and a great favorite with the Almighty. Many examples of
virtue has this loved saint given to us: his love of poverty, his
assiduous labors, his resignation to the will of God in the most trying
circumstances, are practical virtues, which we may endeavor to acquire for
our own spiritual as well as temporal welfare. The affairs of human life
are such, that we often find ourselves having to sustain hard trials, in
which we need precisely those same virtues which made him a great saint.

Let us then enter upon this month with great joy, and continue to honor
this saint, that we may love him, and become particularly devoted to him.
Let us pray especially for our eternal salvation, in which he is greatly
interested being the patron of a happy death, and then we will be sharers,
after this life, in the same glory which he enjoys in heaven.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


After the adoration of the Lord, and the veneration of the Blessed Virgin,
next in order of importance comes the devotion to St. Joseph. Among all
the saints of God in heaven, there is none more powerful, none has more
claim on our confidence and love. Almighty God encourages us to look up to
St. Joseph, for to him were intrusted the greatest treasures that the
world ever saw, Jesus and Mary. Our Lord from the first moment recognized
St. Joseph as the one who took the place of His heavenly Father, and He
obeyed him in all things. Mary respected this saintly man as the head of
the family, as her spouse whom God had sent to her for her protection.
She, before whom the angels bowed in respect, willingly served St. Joseph
in the necessities of this life. The Church of God, the custodian of
truth, revelation, and tradition, has encouraged this devotion by many
indulgences. St. Francis de Sales said to his confessor on the eve of his
death: "Do you not know, venerable father, that I belong to St. Joseph?"
St. Teresa called him her father and master.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, be mindful of me, pray for me, watch over
me. Guardian of the paradise of the new Adam, provide for my temporal
wants. Faithful guardian of the most precious of all treasures, I beseech
thee to bring this matter to a happy end, if it be for the glory of God
and the good of my soul. Amen.



Second Day.


The devotion to St. Joseph, when well understood and faithfully practised,
is undoubtedly a great means of increasing piety. We know well that we
honor the saints most by imitating their virtues, therefore we will
endeavor to acquire these virtues which most distinguished our saint, and
the chief virtue of St. Joseph was piety. We will learn to love Jesus
tenderly; to do all our actions with the intention of pleasing Him, to
remain faithful to the teachings of the Church; all this is piety. The
whole life of St. Joseph was a life of poverty, humility, retirement,
recollection and prayer. When the Egyptian people were starving, and
clamoring for food, Pharao said to them, "Go to Joseph," who had gathered
the superfluous grain of seven abundant years, and kept the keys of the
granaries in his possession. So now, also, can we say confidently, "Go to
Joseph," who holds the keys of the graces and blessings of God. We need
never fear the poverty which may stare us in the face, knowing that all
our needs will be supplied by him.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Third Day.


When Mary was chosen to be Mother of God, the old judgment of God was re-
echoed: "It is not good for man to be alone." God gave her a chaste
spouse. The honor of the Son of God required that He should be born of a
virgin, but He needed a man to protect Him and His Mother. A man worthy of
this trust had to be chosen, and such a one was found in the person of St.
Joseph. He was a man of angelic purity and he would guard the purity of
his bride. He was to be the reputed father of Jesus before the Jews, lest
Mary be stoned for having broken her marriage vows; his purity was to be
in every way similar to that of the purest of virgins. All those who were
immediately connected with the great work of our salvation, were to be
pure and spotless, their sanctity was to be unquestioned. It was the will
of God that the divine origin of His adorable Son should be hid from human
eyes, and Joseph was chosen to become the cloak with which this mystery
was enshrouded. Only in the secrecy of his family life did he manifest his
adoration of the "Word made flesh," and there, as in a sanctuary, he
adored his Lord and Saviour.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


Joseph is that wise and provident servant, who was set over his family to
distribute to it the necessary food at stated times. He is the visible
physical means which God employed for the work of the salvation of
mankind. God chooses, it is true, humble instruments to accomplish His
holy designs, but at the same time He furnishes them with suitable graces,
that His work may be gloriously and effectively performed. Such a servant
was chosen by God in the person of St. Joseph, who was a humble and
saintly man. To him He gave His graces, for He refuses them to the proud.
We too ought to be disinterested and humble in the service of God, using
our natural talents to the fullest extent because they belong to God, and
have been given to us for the special purpose of performing the duties of
our vocation in this world. Disinterestedness and humility are the great
sources from which all good proceeds.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


All the saints were filled with the spirit of the Lord, and in consequence
they esteemed the virtue of humility as the foundation of perfection. St.
Bernard considered this virtue as the corner-stone of the edifice of
faith; the perfection of Christian virtues; the tower of safety, into
which the soul could retire before the insidious attacks of Satan. And St.
Ambrose calls this virtue the first one, and the source of all other
virtues--all other virtues must be combined with humility to give them
value. To no other virtue does God give so many graces. Just because St.
Joseph thought nothing of himself, and lowered himself in the eyes of
others, did Jesus select him as His foster-father. This great virtue of
humility appears in all the circumstances of his life. Though of the royal
house of David, still he did not disdain to labor at the humble trade of a
carpenter. He was perfectly resigned to the providence of God; God's will
was his will, and he never repined at the trials God sent him.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Sixth Day.


Joseph consented to become the spouse of the Blessed Virgin, because he
knew he could preserve the chastity which he had vowed to keep, and
because he could be the guardian of the virginity of Mary. Little did he
suspect that he was to become the spouse of the Mother of God. St. Bridget
had a vision, in which the sentiments of St. Joseph were made known to her
by the Blessed Virgin herself. She said: "When Joseph, who was given to me
by the Most High as my protector, knew of the mystery of the incarnation,
which was operated in me by the power of the Holy Ghost, he was filled
with astonishment, and conceived not the least suspicion against my
purity. He believed firmly in the prophecies which proclaimed that the Son
of God would be born of a Virgin, and therefore he considered himself
unworthy to serve such an exalted Mother." St. Joseph learned the virtue
of humility still more profoundly in his association with Jesus and Mary,
for how could it be otherwise when he hourly observed their self-
abnegation? Daily did he see the Mother of God engaged in the most lowly
services.

Prayer.

Holy Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


What must have been the feelings of the holy patriarch in witnessing the
humiliation of the Son of God! What must have been his astonishment, when
the divine wisdom of the Child Jesus asked him his counsel, obeyed him in
all things, and was for many years his fellow-laborer at his humble trade!
The Lord taught him the great lesson: to be meek and humble of heart.
Surely we may suppose that St. Joseph was in a constant ecstasy of
adoration as he contemplated the Son of God, lowered to the condition of a
helpless child, and afterwards by natural growth becoming a man and
laboring at such humble employment. How could he have within himself one
spark of pride or vanity in the knowledge that he was a descendant of King
David? Therefore he humbled himself all the more, and only considered
himself great in the thought that he was allowed to imitate the
humiliation of the Son of God. Let us learn from St. Joseph the value of
this virtue, and practise it all our lives. Let us often enter the Sacred
Heart of Jesus to learn from Him meekness and humility.

Prayer For Humility.

Glorious patron, St. Joseph, let me understand the deep feeling with which
thou didst witness the humble lives of Jesus and Mary. How far am I from
being able to say that I have acquired this virtue! Thou seekest only to
hide from the gaze of the world the divine gifts with which thou art
enriched, whilst I seek to draw the attention of the world on myself, to
shine before the world, and to be much thought of. O my loving protector,
my patron, my father, obtain for me the virtue of humility, which is the
foundation of all perfection. Obtain for me the great grace to know
myself, to despise myself, to look for humiliations from others, to feel
inferior to all, that in the future I may desire no other witness of my
actions but God, and no other reward but God. Amen.



Eighth Day.


When God had created Adam, and made him strong and intelligent, He found
that one great thing was wanting. Adam needed a companion; he could not
content himself in all the superabundance that was around him. Then God
took a rib out of the first man, and built a woman upon it. The same thing
seems true in the case of the Blessed Virgin. She was all alone in the
spiritual order among men. She was endowed with many graces, yet in all
her abundance she would be desolate, only God said, let us make her a
companion like unto herself, one who would also be the favorite creature
of God, and would be the recipient of many extraordinary graces. He
therefore chose a great saint, and gave him special gifts. A prince of
this world does the same thing when he desires to make a lowly subject his
companion; he first makes him a noble, then enriches him with much wealth
in order that the favorite may make a good appearance before the world.
God united in St. Joseph all the virtues and graces of the other saints,
that he might be greater than they. From all eternity it had been ordained
that St. Joseph was to be the foster-father of Jesus.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Ninth Day.


Great must have been the terror of Mary when the angel of God appeared to
her, and announced that she was to be the Mother of God. She was troubled,
but the angel encouraged her, saying, "Fear not, Mary." The angel
announced the incarnation to St. Joseph, and he was greatly troubled; the
angel assured him, "Fear not, Joseph, Son of David." Mary gave life to the
Lord and brought Him up. Joseph, on his part, labored day and night to
scrape together what was necessary for their existence. Both Mary and
Joseph were equally, according to their position, contributing to the
rearing of Jesus. Like Mary, the Mother of Jesus, St. Joseph is powerful
with her divine Son. St. Joseph is called, by the Holy Ghost, a just man.
He was the first to be exposed to the persecutions of the Jews for the
Lord. In all things then, is Joseph like unto Mary; similar also are his
virtues, and like also his eternal reward.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Tenth Day.


We may trace other phases of similarity between the Blessed Virgin and St.
Joseph. Mary is the Queen of angels, high above them, because she is the
Mother of the Creator; she is then all-powerful, and she can use these
heavenly spirits for the glory of God. St. Joseph is not inferior to the
angels in purity; his mind was always careful to guard against any
pollution; he was a guardian angel to Jesus, Our Lord. This office made
him a great being in the sight of Jesus Himself, for He acknowledged His
guardian angel and was on the most intimate terms with him. St. Joseph
served Our Lord as a throne. The choir of thrones are the angels on whom
God is carried about in majesty, and Jesus was carried about in the arms
of St. Joseph. The seraphims, in a certain degree, were inferior to St.
Joseph. The angels have no paternity, but St. Joseph is called the father
of Jesus. The angels could then bow down before St. Joseph, and
acknowledge and call him their superior, because he had received a
commission which no angel had ever yet received, and because he had a name
which had never been given to any of these holy choirs.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Eleventh Day.


It was the privilege of the father to give a name to the child, and this
privilege St. Joseph exercised at the circumcision of the Lord. It was he
too who usually performed the painful operation of the circumcision. Thus
it was that St. Joseph shed the first drops of the adorable blood which
was to redeem mankind. The name of Jesus had been predestined for the
Saviour, and given by God Himself; but Joseph, the father on earth, was
commissioned to declare it publicly. O great saint! you cannot give to
this divine Child a greater dignity than He possesses, for He is your
Creator and Lord; but you do the next greatest thing, you give him a name
which publishes Him to the world in His character of Redeemer--this great
honor is reserved for you. Holy name of Jesus, the greatest of all names,
before the mention of which all heaven and earth shall bow their knees in
adoration, be to me a source of heavenly joy, and a consolation in all the
trials of life.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Twelfth Day.


Joseph, no doubt, understood all the importance and meaning of the name of
Jesus. He therefore knew all the obligations which this holy name imposed
on the divine Child, as well as the obligations which it imposed on
himself. He understood that Jesus must be the man of sorrows and derision,
and that he must share His destiny. St. Joseph always had the image of the
crucified Lord before his eyes. If the faith of the great Apostle of the
world was such that he carried the image of the crucified Redeemer always
before his eyes, much the more can this be said of our saint, for he had
Jesus always with him. When he embraced His sacred head, he had before him
that head crowned with thorns, and bowed on His breast in His last agony;
he could see that little body covered with wounds from the scourging. God
treated St. Joseph as His most intimate friend, and filled him with His
share of sorrow. Do we wish to enter into the glory of the Lord, then we,
too, must suffer patiently. The closer we follow the Lord, the more
intimate we are with Him, the more we will look for sufferings, and love
them because they make us resemble the Lord more closely.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Thirteenth Day.


St. Joseph was a man of faith. We read in St. Paul, "the just man lives by
faith." It is the foundation of sanctity, it is the fountain of our
spiritual life. All the works of St. Joseph were done in a spirit of
faith. Were it not for this spirit of faith, he would never have consented
to become the spouse of the Blessed Virgin, for he desired to preserve his
own chastity; and the spirit of faith taught him how he might do this.
When he had entered upon his duties as spouse, he noticed that the Virgin
was with child, and he fell into deep sorrow and concern, until an angel
appeared, dispelling all his doubts: "Joseph, son of David, fear not to
take unto thee Mary, thy wife: for that which is conceived in her, is of
the Holy Ghost; and she shall bring forth a Son: and thou shalt call His
name Jesus: for He will save His people from their sins."--Matt. i. 20, 21.
The spirit of faith made him believe in these words, whether he understood
them or not. He subjected his will to the manner in which God wished to
redeem mankind, and he was forever afterwards without solicitude.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Fourteenth Day.


Then came a new trial to the faith of St. Joseph. In due course of time
the Lord was born, a little helpless Child, in the humble stable at
Bethlehem: where He was wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and laid on a little
straw in a manger. Joseph became the first adorer, after the Blessed
Virgin. But it required great faith to recognize in this weak Infant the
Son of the most high God; still the grace of God sustained him, and he
humbly adored. The angel had promised a wonderful Child. He was to be a
powerful being, Who would conquer the demons of hell, and free the people
of Israel. Now Joseph beholds a small, weak Infant, beginning life in
poverty and distress. Far from being a powerful creature He even needs the
help of Mary and Joseph. St. Joseph carried the Child in his arms, and yet
at the same time acknowledged that the same Child in heaven was carried
about on the shoulders of the holiest angels, and governed the universe
with His will. He heard the wailings of the Child, but knew that He was
the joy of paradise. He taught Him the praises of His heavenly Father,
knowing at the same time that He was eternal wisdom.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Fifteenth Day.


Joseph is eminently the just man who lives by faith. No sooner is the
Child Jesus born, than, as if an unforeseen accident had happened, which
made it necessary to fly, as if there were no God to protect that Babe, an
angel appeared to Joseph in his sleep, and bids him arise, and take the
Child and His Mother, and fly into the land of Egypt. The enemies of the
Child will be on your heels, and all depends on your rapid flight, to save
Him from their hands. "Fly into Egypt," a far-off foreign country. He gets
up, and hastily gathering the few necessary articles, makes off in the
dead of night, so that the people of Bethlehem may not know where he has
gone. But Joseph performs his duty in a spirit of faith: he does not doubt
the omnipotence of God. He feels that such is the command of God, and he
makes no objections, but goes with alacrity into the poverty and suffering
which he knows are inevitable.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Sixteenth Day.


Joseph remained in Egypt until the time of Herod's death. The angel again
appears to him, and bids him return to Judea, as if the divine Infant were
not sure of His life until His enemies had disappeared. What frailty, what
meekness in this little Child! Can this be a God? Without the least
hesitation, Joseph treats the Child with the same reverence, and adores
Him, as if he had seen Him working miracles. Never was such a faith found
in Israel. Nowadays we could not find such a faith. "From a want of this
noble faith," St. Teresa says, "the world is full of sin." Ask St. Joseph
to obtain for us a faith similar to his. Faith is a gift and a virtue. By
this gift our intellect is enlightened, we know God, and confide in Him.
By the virtue of faith we use this light, and let it shine on all our
actions. Let us not be satisfied to bow down our intellect under the
influence of the great grace of the gift of faith; we should regulate all
the actions of our life according to the dictates and laws of this faith,
and live according to it. St. Joseph can obtain such graces for us, if we
pray to him.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Seventeenth Day.


St. Joseph possesses another great virtue: it is his obedience. From his
childhood he observed with conscientious exactitude all the laws of God.
Without a murmur he accompanied Mary to Bethlehem in a severe time of the
year, and with Mary so soon to give birth to the Child Jesus, to fulfil
the command of a heathen prince. When the command was given to take up the
Child and flee into Egypt, he was ready. But one word is necessary: he
does not consider any plans for flight, but executes the command without a
moment's delay. In many cases he could have alleged causes of
inconvenience, or of his not understanding how it could be accomplished;
he might have asked the angel for an explanation, saying, how comes it
that a few days ago you announced that this Jesus is to be the Redeemer of
His people, and now He is to fly before His enemies? He will not be able
to free His people afterwards, when now He cannot hold His ground. But he
subjected his reason to his faith, and obeyed.

Through our faith God leads us to the knowledge of His goodness and His
promises, that so the desire and hope of enjoying God may be born in us.
St. Joseph's faith and knowledge of God effected in him a great
confidence; he had been peculiarly confirmed in hope. It is a fact that
our confidence in God grows with grace when our hope is strengthened by
the infinite merits of Jesus Christ, and when we have great devotion and
love for the Blessed Virgin; so we must certainly conclude that Joseph's
love of Jesus, Whom he daily carried in his arms, should lay a greater
foundation of hope than that of any of the saints. The flight into Egypt
is an example of it. His confidence in the providence of God is so
implicit that he makes no preparation. There is Jesus, the Son of God, Who
is to go with Him; there is Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, who is to be
of the party. These are the two strongest pillars of our hope, and why not
to the hope of St. Joseph? God the Father will provide. Is He not the God
Who, with a strong arm, led the Israelites out of Egypt, and, after forty
years of wandering, introduced them according to promise into the land
flowing with milk and honey?

In Joseph's flight into Egypt, he knew that Jesus was a more powerful
protector of a perilous journey than the Ark of the Covenant which was
carried before the tribes of Israel, or the column of smoke that led them
during the day and the pillar of fire that protected them at night. He
would be the manna, the inexhaustible food, in a desert and strange land.
Accompanied by this treasure, St. Joseph is content to suffer for Jesus,
and under the eyes of Jesus. We can imagine the sympathy of Joseph for his
charge, when he relieved the Blessed Virgin of her burden, and had Him to
rest on his bosom. Good and faithful Christian, in all the trials of life
keep Jesus close to your heart, and when the world storms and frets, be
faithful to your promises made in Baptism, and often repeated during your
Christian life by receiving the sacraments.

Twentieth Day.


The providence of God knows what our destiny is, and what is the best for
us. Then let us be resigned to His will. All our anxieties would disappear
if we were thoroughly convinced of the goodness of God in our behalf; but
because we want to do everything without God, not only do we feel anxiety
for the future, but disaster will really overtake us. Let us trust in
Providence and give Him entire control of all that concerns us. In all our
necessities let us pray and wait, until it is God's pleasure to step in,
and do away with our troubles, if it be to His greater glory; or if not,
then let us patiently bear them. We know that Providence so watches over
us, that not a hair falls from our head without His approval. God has His
reasons for all that He does, and for all the evil that He permits, though
we may not be able to see them. In this way the Christian soul sleeps
softly and peacefully in the arms of God, as a child in the arms of its
mother. As David, the prophet king, sang in his psalms: "I will sleep and
rest in peace because Thou, O Lord, hast founded my hope on Thy
providence. Thy mercy shall accompany me all the days of my life."

Joseph lived in Egypt for eight years, among a pagan people, without
repining, without being distressed at the prolonged stay, an exile from
his own country and relatives. There, far from the sacred Temple of God,
he remained in seclusion, serving God in his soul. Who can tell the
suffering he underwent among the barbarians, amid their shocking practises
of religion, which were abhorrent to him who was so closely united to God?
Good people are in the same condition in the wickedness of the world: it
is a cross to them. But crosses are to be met with everywhere; you cannot
escape. If you get rid of one cross, another is waiting for you, and
perhaps a far heavier one; but your consolation should be the knowledge
that Jesus, Mary, and Joseph endured the same sufferings. Joseph lived in
the Holy Family with the greatest recollection. This should also be the
case with those who live in the world, that fiery oven of the trials of
God; they should sing the praises of God in the very midst of
distractions, and be perfectly recollected, serving God without being led
away from the path of duty.

Twenty-second Day.


So greatly did Jesus love poverty, that, not finding it in heaven, He came
upon the earth to practise it. All those principally associated with Our
Lord in the salvation of mankind were obliged to endure poverty. Since the
Lord loved poverty so much, St. Joseph, too, had to practise this virtue.
Even before St. Joseph was selected to become the foster-father of Our
Lord, he was poor according to the will of God, but afterwards he learned
the virtue still more from the example of Our Lord. If one single sentence
that he had heard from the Gospel, induced St. Antony, abbot and patriarch
of monks, to give all his wealth to the poor, how much more did the
example of Our Lord act effectively on Joseph, so that he renounced all
expectation of worldly advancement. Often in their communing with each
other, the question of their destitution must have been the topic; but it
was not to find ways and means to avoid it; on the contrary that they
should be patient in the trial. Joseph possessed nothing; hence he
witnessed the Lord in His poverty laid in a manger after His birth. At the
presentation he could make no other offering but that of very poor people,
a pair of pigeons which could be bought for very little money. He also had
to undergo many hardships on his journey to Egypt.

Twenty-third Day.


In Egypt, so tradition has it, Joseph had to labor for others in order to
bring in the means of a livelihood for himself and the Holy Family. Even
then their income was by no means superfluous, and according to St.
Liguori they often had to suffer actual want. In this manner Joseph spent
eight years in Egypt. When he was recalled by the voice of the angel, he
settled in Nazareth; though his circumstances there were probably better,
they were by no means luxurious. Bossuet says: "Imagine a poor laborer,
who had no other fortune than the labor of his willing hands, no other
means of subsistence but his work. Every day he saw the end of his
provision, and he had to begin again on the following day, like our poor
working people. Still he was rich in contentment; he had enough, because
he had nothing which might be coveted by others; he possessed all because
he stood in need of everything; he was happy, quiet, secure, although he
had no place whereon to rest his head. He was continually constrained to
labor with the sweat of his brow. He divided all his income with Jesus and
Mary. Was it not a consolation for him to do this? even according to our
weak reason, guided by religion."

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Twenty-fourth Day.


When we have contemplated the willing poverty of Joseph, the thought
naturally comes to us to imitate him in the practise of this virtue.
Poverty makes us like to the Lord. Our Lord walks before us with giant
strides in the practise of this virtue. The rich, burdened with the goods
of this world, can hardly follow Him. Let us consider that, after all, our
happiness is not to be found in the possession of wealth. He is happy,
according to St. Augustine, who possesses what he wants, and who wants
nothing beyond what God has sent him. The rich are frequently unhappy,
because they are carried along to desire the things which they cannot
reach. Not only is poverty a source of virtue and of peace; but also it is
a means by which we can make progress in our perfection. For as avarice is
the source of all evils, so also poverty is the power by which all our
vices are corrected, and held in check. This virtue watches over humility:
a virtue so very necessary to our perfection, and it preserves chastity by
reason of the mortification of our senses.

The interior life of the Holy Family in Nazareth must have been a most
beautiful one. They were joined so closely to God, that there was no
earthly distraction which could separate them from contemplating and
communing with Him. They formed a kind of trinity on earth, a
representation of the Trinity in heaven. These three were one, because
they were united by the bond of union, Jesus Christ. The people of
Nazareth did not know the adorable person of the Lord, nor the dignity of
the Mother of God. They knew Joseph by sight, for he had often gone out to
look for work, and necessarily came more in contact with his neighbors.
That holy house of Nazareth was a perfect paradise, full of peace, of
order, recollection, unity, and happiness. Their conversation was about
God and the best means to comply with His holy will. Joseph and Mary
adored the Lord because He was God; but they exacted His obedience because
He was their Son.

Let us think to-day, of the social life between Joseph and Mary. St.
Joseph was a very great saint, and Mary was unstained by sin: so pure, so
holy, that no created being could be compared to her. What can we suppose
was the conversation of these heavenly beings? When Mary visited her
cousin, St. Elizabeth, John, in his mother's womb, leaped for joy. In
other words, the presence of the God-man in the womb of the Blessed Virgin
scattered graces about her with god-like profusion, and certainly St.
Joseph, too, was affected by it. With as lively a faith as we have before
the tabernacle on the altar, St. Joseph must have recognized the presence
of the Lord, for he was acquainted with the mystery of the incarnation, as
it had been revealed by the mouth of the angel. We are silent, and sunk in
deep devotion in church, where God dwells. Was St. Joseph less impressed
than we, when he recognized Him Who was the Son of God, and Who was to
redeem His people Israel from their sins? How great was their devotion to
the hidden Lord, how fervent their prayers! Still St. Joseph was the
master in that house; he was the head of the family, and was obeyed in all
his instructions.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Twenty-seventh Day.


Joseph was obedient to the Law of Moses; scrupulously exact in following
the instructions of the Jewish ceremonial, as all good Jews were. Poor as
he was, and notwithstanding the loss of time it necessarily entailed, he
still went every year, as was the custom, to Jerusalem to celebrate the
feast of the Passover. He did this because it was a law of Moses. The
Blessed Virgin and the Child Jesus were equally anxious to fulfil the law.
And when the feast was over, all went back to Nazareth, but Jesus remained
behind, and hid Himself from Joseph for three days, making him feel
wretched, because he thought that he had been delinquent in his trust of
the divine Jesus. But Jesus wants to be looked for, not with an ordinary
desire, but with a real love, and the longer we are separated from Him the
more loving should we become, because our heart is desolate without His
holy presence. O my God, I have sought Thee all my life! but I have not
found Thee because I do not look for Thee where Thou art to be found.
Indeed Thou art in my heart, but I go out and look for Thee in
distractions where Thou shalt not be found.

Prayer.

Holy St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, etc., etc.



Twenty-eighth Day.


St. Joseph, as we have seen, earned his livelihood by the sweat of his
brow. When Jesus grew up and was stronger, He helped His father, and
tradition tells us that the Blessed Virgin was not idle. She sewed and
embroidered in order that they might live. The lot of the laborer is
always hard, and St. Joseph's life, beyond the consolations of religion,
was no exception. Day after day work was necessary, and pleasures and
recreations few. That Joseph was of the royal house of David was forgotten
because he was poor; had he been rich people would have honored him, would
have given him political prominence. Let us also sanctify our labors;
Joseph's work made him holy, because it was honest work, done with a good
intention and in the spirit of prayer. Prayer and work were the constant
employment of St. Joseph; this is the way that God wishes us to spend our
time. He wishes us to pursue an active, laborious life, while we keep our
eyes on Him.

Prayer.

Twenty-ninth Day.


The whole life of St. Joseph is a perfect model of a Christian life, a
life which we must necessarily lead in order to go to heaven; a life of
piety and faithful fulfilment of the duties of our station, and the
performance of our daily actions in the best manner. In this way St.
Joseph reached heaven, and we cannot choose another road. Joseph did
nothing extraordinary in a worldly sense; he was no king, with great
command of men; he was not a literary man; but he was great, because he
made himself, with the grace of God, a great saint. He lived a simple life
as far as possible, he strove to perfect himself more and more in the
presence of Jesus, his daily companion, and consequently he was always
impressed with the omnipresence of God, before Whom he walked in the
simplicity of his heart all the days of his life. He is the best model of
obedience to Jesus and Mary. In his life we can find a great example of
all Christian virtues.

Thirtieth Day.


As the life of St. Joseph was such a perfect one, the seal of approval
from almighty God was placed upon it by the grace of a happy death. For
thirty years St. Joseph was the head of the Holy Family, and now Jesus was
to go forth on His public mission. By the disposition of divine
Providence, when his course had been completed and the purpose of his life
was over, he was called away to another world to be rewarded for his holy
life. What death was ever more precious in the sight of God, than that of
St. Joseph! St. Paul exclaimed that the grace of God was not ineffectual
in him, and it gave him great joy. But much more did Joseph co-operate
with the graces received, so that he was sure that every moment of his
life was spent for the greater glory of God. Holy Scripture describes the
death of the just as a peaceful falling asleep in the Lord. Precious in
the sight of God is the death of His holy ones. They can exclaim, "I know
that my Redeemer liveth and mine eyes shall behold Him on the Last Day."
St. Joseph died in peace and happiness in the embrace of Jesus and Mary;
his soul was sent forth to the abode of the patriarchs at the bidding of
Jesus, Who had created him. What words can describe the consolations that
filled this noble breast, and with what confidence he looked up to his
Redeemer! And so St. Joseph has become the patron of a happy death.

Thirty-first Day.


On this last day of the month, let us consider the power of St. Joseph for
our good in heaven, so that we may draw from it confidence in his
willingness to use it for our spiritual and temporal welfare. The general
principle is, the greater the saint the greater friend he is of almighty
God; and the greater is the power given him by God for the benefit of
those who live in this vale of tears. We may with reason assert that after
the Blessed Virgin, St. Joseph is the greatest saint in heaven. He has
been distinguished by God with the greatest privileges on earth, which
certainly did not cease in heaven but rather increased. The heavenly
Father loved him, because he represented the paternity of His divine Son
on earth. God the Son loved him because he was the protector of His
infancy and youth, and the faithful guardian and spouse of the Blessed
Virgin. The Holy Ghost loved him, because he complied so faithfully to His
inspirations. In this predilection for him by the Holy Trinity, lies the
secret of his great power. Who will say, if he asks for anything from God,
that his prayer will be rejected? Let us turn with confidence to the
patronage of St. Joseph, and entreat him to pray for us in all our
necessities.

_To Obtain a Happy Death and Other Good Intentions._

Ever-blessed and glorious Joseph, kind and indulgent father, and
compassionate friend of all in sorrow, through that bitter grief with
which thy heart was saturated, when thou didst behold the sufferings of
the Infant Saviour, and in thy prophetic view didst contemplate His most
ignominious Passion and death, take pity, I beseech thee, on my poverty
and necessities, counsel me in my doubts, and console me in all my
anxieties. Thou art the good father and protector of orphans, the advocate
of the defenceless, the patron of those who are in need and desolation. Do
not, then, disregard the petition of thy poor child; my sins have drawn
down upon me the just displeasure of my God, and hence I am surrounded
with sorrows. To thee, O amiable guardian of the poor neglected family of
Nazareth, do I fly for shelter and protection. Listen, then, I entreat of
thee, with a father's solicitude, to the earnest prayer of thy poor
supplicant, and obtain for me the objects of my petition. I ask it by the
infinite mercy of the eternal Son of God, which induced Him to assume our
nature and be born into this world of sorrow. I ask it by the grief which
filled thy heart when, ignorant of the mystery wrought in thy immaculate
spouse, thou didst fear thou shouldst be separated from her. I ask it by
that weariness, solicitude, and suffering which thou didst endure when
thou soughtest in vain at the inns of Bethlehem a shelter for the sacred
Virgin and a birthplace for the Infant God, and when, being everywhere
refused, thou wert obliged to consent that the Queen of heaven should give
birth to the world's Redeemer in a wretched stable. I ask it by that most
sad and painful duty imposed on thee when, the divine Child being eight
days old, thou wert obliged to inflict a deep wound on His tender body,
and thus be the first to make flow that sacred blood which was to wash
away the sins of the world. I ask it by the sweetness and power of that
sacred name, Jesus, which thou didst confer on the adorable Infant. I ask
it by that mortal anguish inflicted on thee by the prophecy of holy
Simeon, which declared the Child Jesus and His holy Mother the future
victims of their love and our sins. I ask it through that sorrow and
anguish which filled thy soul when the angel declared to thee that the
life of the Child Jesus was sought by His enemies, from whose impious
designs thou wert obliged to fly with Him and His blessed Mother into
Egypt. I ask it by all the pains, fatigues, and toils of that long and
perilous pilgrimage. I ask it by all the sorrows thou didst endure when in
Egypt thou wert not able, even by the sweat of thy brow, to procure poor
food and clothing for thy most poor family. I ask it by all the grief thou
didst feel each time the divine Child asked for a morsel of bread, and
thou hadst it not to give Him. I ask it by all thy solicitude to preserve
the sacred Child and the immaculate Mary during thy second journey, when
thou wert ordered to return to thy native country. I ask it by thy
peaceful dwelling in Nazareth, in which so many joys and sorrows were
mingled. I ask it by thy extreme affliction in being deprived three days
of the company of the adorable Child. I ask it by thy joy at finding Him
in the Temple, and by the ineffable consolation imparted to thee in the
cottage of Nazareth with the company and society of the little Jesus. I
ask it by that wonderful condescension by which He subjected Himself to
thy will. I ask it through that dolorous view, continually in thy mind, of
all thy Jesus was to suffer. I ask it by that painful contemplation, which
made thee foresee the divine little hands and feet, now so active in
serving thee, one day to be pierced with cruel nails; that head which
rested gently on thy bosom, crowned with sharp thorns; that delicate body
which thou didst tenderly fold in thy mantle and press to thy heart,
stripped and extended on a cross. I ask it by that heroic sacrifice of thy
will and best affection by which thou didst offer up to the eternal Father
the last awful moment when the Man-God was to expire for our salvation. I
ask it by that perfect love and conformity with which thou didst receive
the divine order to depart from this life, and from the company of Jesus
and Mary. I ask it by that exceeding great joy which filled thy soul when
the Redeemer of the world, triumphant over death and hell, entered into
the possession of His kingdom, and conducted thee also into it with
especial honors. I ask it through Mary's glorious assumption, and through
that interminable bliss, which with her, thou wilt eternally derive from
the presence of God. O good father! I beseech thee by all thy sufferings,
sorrows, and joys, to hear me and to obtain the grant of my earnest
petitions. (_Here name them or reflect on them._) Obtain for all those who
have asked thy prayers all that is useful to them in the designs of God;
and finally, my dear protector, be thou with me and all who are dear to me
in our last moments, that we may eternally chant the praises of Jesus,
Mary, and Joseph. Amen.



Choice Of St. Joseph As A Patron.


O blessed Joseph, faithful guardian of my Redeemer, Jesus Christ,
protector of thy chaste spouse, the Virgin Mother of God, I choose thee
this day to be my special patron and advocate, and I firmly resolve to
honor thee from this time forth. Therefore I humbly beseech thee to
receive me as thy client, to instruct me in every doubt, to comfort me in
every affliction, to obtain for me and for all the knowledge and love of
the Heart of Jesus, and finally to defend and protect me at the hour of
death. Amen.



Virginum Custos.


Guardian of Virgins, and father, holy Joseph, to whose faithful care
Christ Jesus, Innocence itself, and Mary, Virgin of virgins, were
committed, I pray and beg of thee, by these dear pledges, Jesus and Mary,
free me from all uncleanness, and make me with spotless mind, pure heart,
and chaste body, ever most chastely to serve Jesus and Mary all the days
of my life. Amen.


    An indulgence of one hundred days, once a day.



Sorrows and Joys of St. Joseph.


1. O glorious St. Joseph, most pure spouse of thy most holy Mary, even as
the trouble and anguish of thy heart was great in the perplexity of
abandoning thy most chaste and stainless spouse, so, too, inexplicable was
thy delight when by the angel was revealed to thee the sovereign mystery
of the incarnation.

Through this sorrow and this joy of thine, we pray thee, now and in our
last agony, to comfort our soul with the joy of a good life, and of a holy
death, like unto thine between Jesus and Mary.

Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be to the Father.

2. O glorious St. Joseph, most blessed patriarch, who wast selected for
the office of reputed father of the Word made man, the grief which thou
didst feel at seeing the Child Jesus born in such great poverty was
suddenly changed for thee into heavenly exultation at hearing the angelic
harmony, and seeing the glories of that most resplendent night.

Through this sorrow and this joy of thine, we beseech thee to obtain for
us that, after the journey of this life is over, we may pass hence to hear
the angelic praises, and to enjoy the splendors of the glory of heaven.

Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be to the Father.

3. O glorious St. Joseph, who didst fulfil most obediently all God's
commands, the most precious blood which the Child Redeemer shed in the
circumcision struck death into thy heart, but the name of Jesus revived
it, and filled it full of joy.

Through this sorrow and this joy of thine, obtain for us that, all vices
having been taken from us during life, we may expire in exultation with
the most holy name of Jesus in our hearts and upon our lips.

Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be to the Father.

4. O most glorious St. Joseph, most faithful saint, who wast a partaker in
the mysteries of our redemption, if Simeon's prophecy of that which Jesus
and Mary were to suffer caused thee a mortal pang, it filled thee also
with a blessed joy at the salvation and glorious resurrection of
innumerable souls, which he at the same time foretold would thence
proceed.

Through this sorrow and this joy of thine, obtain for us that we may be of
the number of those who, through the merits of Jesus, and at the
intercession of the Virgin Mother, are to rise again in glory.

Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be to the Father.

5. O glorious St. Joseph, most watchful guardian and familiar attendant of
the incarnate Son of God, how much didst thou suffer in supporting and in
serving the Son of the Most High, particularly in the flight which thou
hadst to make into Egypt; but how much again didst thou rejoice at having
always with thee that same God, and at seeing the idols of Egypt fall to
the ground.

Through this sorrow and this joy of thine, obtain for us that, by keeping
far from us hell's tyrant, especially by flying from dangerous occasions,
every idol of earthly affection may fall from our hearts; and that, wholly
occupied in the service of Jesus and of Mary, we may live for them alone,
and die a happy death.

Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be to the Father.

6. O glorious St. Joseph, angel of the earth, who didst marvel at
beholding the King of heaven subject to thy commands, if thy consolation
at bringing him back from Egypt was disturbed by the fear of Archelaus,
yet, assured by the angel, thou didst with Jesus and Mary dwell in joy at
Nazareth.

Through this sorrow and this joy of thine, obtain for us that our heart,
unclouded by hurtful fears, may enjoy peace of conscience, and that we may
live secure with Jesus and Mary, and with them may also die.

Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be to the Father.

7. O glorious St. Joseph, model of all holiness, when, without fault of
thine, thou hadst lost the Child Jesus, thou didst seek Him for three days
in the greatest sorrow, until with joyful heart thou didst possess again
thy life, finding Him in the Temple, among the doctors.

Through this sorrow and this joy of thine, with fervent sighs we
supplicate thee to interpose in our behalf, that so it may never befall us
to lose Jesus by mortal sin; but that, if unhappily we ever lose Him, we
may seek Him again with unwearied sorrow, until once more we find His
favor, especially at the moment of our death, that so we may pass to the
enjoyment of Him in heaven, and there, with thee, sing His divine mercies
for all eternity.

Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be to the Father.

APRIL. THE PASSION: MEDITATIONS FOR EVERY DAY OF LENT.


During the month of April we generally celebrate Holy Week, and so this
month is dedicated to the Passion of Our Lord. The followers of Christ
should be acquainted with the history of their leader, Jesus, the Master;
they should know what He has endured for His followers, and they should
think frequently of His sufferings, especially in Lent, when the Church,
in all her offices, keeps the commemoration of the Passion foremost in her
mind. There are many things to be done during this month. You ought to
recite the stations of the cross privately, or be present when they are
publicly performed; hear sermons on religious topics, practise a little
fast or abstinence. This last is not so much to do, yet God takes note of
it, and makes a great fuss over it, like a father that has received an
insignificant present from his child. Take from any book the meditations
on the Passion, read them slowly, and with sympathy; slowly, so as to be
able to follow the recital and to be able to realize it; with sympathy,
that you should bring to it a feeling for Our Lord, and show that you are
touched with all that He endured for you. The God-man going to a
disgraceful death, after a most apparently unsuccessful life, should make
us feel for the loving Jesus. St. Augustine remarks that nothing is so
useful to our advancement in the spiritual life, as daily to meditate on
the Passion of Our Lord. Certainly the most appropriate time for these
considerations and prayers is during Lent, which happens about this time.

We shall give forty short considerations for every day in Lent. They can
be begun upon Ash Wednesday; we will then strive to gain spiritual benefit
from these considerations, by perusing them with piety and with a great
love for our crucified Lord. Before the time of Augustine, Origen writes
that it is impossible for a man to remain in sin, as long as he often
remembers the sufferings of Our Lord, and nothing will so inflame our
hearts with love for Christ. Father Alvarez said that so many Christians
are lost, because they ignore the treasures that are concealed in the
Passion of Our Lord; and he led his penitents to perfection by enjoining
on them frequent contemplation of the Passion. St. Francis de Sales tells
us, "That every wound of Our Lord is a tongue, which teaches what the Lord
suffered for us." What flames of love will naturally burn in our hearts,
when we see the love with which Our Lord regarded us! Happy, therefore,
the soul who will find leisure for this holy exercise of the mind and
heart. "You will draw water with joy from the fountains of the Saviour."
The sinner will receive confidence in the mercy of God, and know that his
case is not so desperate as long as he has the wounds of the Lord to plead
to the Father for mercy and forgiveness--for all our transgressions have
been laid upon the shoulders of Jesus.

How, then, can we have any fear, says St. Paul, that God will refuse us
His graces? "He that spared not even His own Son, but delivered Him up for
us all."




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


Before Our Lord's suffering took place, He disclosed to His disciples the
story of the cross. It was good for them to understand and to remember
what the sufferings of Jesus were to be. The prophets of the Old Testament
had declared that the Son of man must suffer. Daniel, especially,
describes the Passion of Our Lord very minutely. This was the future that
was before Our Lord, and it was well that the disciples should know it and
think of it. So it should be with ourselves. We, too, are the disciples
and followers of Christ, and we, too, must make the Passion a subject of
serious thought. The Church has chosen the Lenten time as the most
appropriate for this exercise. She joins penance with this meditation, as
being the most efficacious means of stirring ourselves up to a pious life.
Let us approach these meditations with a conviction that we are really
unworthy to be admitted to the graces of this holy contemplation; but
Jesus will help us.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, whilst before Thy face I humbly
kneel, and with burning soul pray and beseech Thee to fix deep in my heart
lively sentiments of faith, hope, and charity, true contrition for my
sins, and a firm purpose of amendment; the while I contemplate with great
love and tender pity Thy five wounds, pondering over them within me,
whilst I call to mind the words which David, Thy prophet, said of Thee, my
Jesus: "They pierced My hands and My feet; they numbered all My
bones."--Ps. xxi. 17, 18.



Second Day.


It is not hard to understand why the Lord desires us to think of His
Passion. St. Francis Xavier is said to have gone over the Passion once
every month; but we know, too, with what love he was attached to the Lord,
with what wonderful patience and perseverance he continued to labor. It
was the effect of the meditation on the Passion. We, too, should grow in
the love of Our Lord. But how will we grow, unless by contemplating all
that Jesus has done for us in His Passion, until He died on the cross? As
the Apostle says, "He loved me, and delivered Himself up for me." In this
way the Lord wants us to study His Passion, so that we may learn how
intensely He loved us; that although He was God, and we poor miserable
creatures, still He did not hesitate to sacrifice His life in order to
redeem us from eternal perdition.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Third Day.


Our Lord desires that we should think of His Passion, in order that we may
imitate Him in our own sufferings: for we have many things to endure in
this life on account of the original fault of our first parents. You will
learn to die with Christ, and your sympathetic heart will avoid sin. By
the frequent thought of the Passion the Lord will have you love the
sacrifice of the Mass, where in an unbloody manner the Passion of Our Lord
is repeated, and we begin to appreciate it the more the better we
understand their relation to each other. The Lord will have you show
sympathy for Him in His sufferings; for you must remember that it was for
you that He suffered, that you caused His suffering by your sins. Now, if
you have inflicted these punishments on the Lord, would it not be an act
of horrible ingratitude if you were not to show your sympathy for Christ?
Another effect of the contemplation of the Passion will be that you shall
be stirred up to do great things for Christ. Your time of labor will be
sanctified, and your life will be given to the service of Jesus.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


We should think often of the Passion of Our Lord, but not with coldness or
repugnance. It is a sad subject, and not at all pleasing to the human
feelings, but when we have learned to love Jesus it will be an exercise
that will make us very happy. We are dreadfully poor spiritually, and
nowhere will we be able to find more spiritual wealth than in the Heart of
Jesus in His Passion. "There flow living fountains of blessed waters,
there is the bread of life." Approach, then, with a lively faith to the
foot of the cross, and remain there faithfully; let the blood of the Lord
flow upon your body and soul, realize that Jesus died for you, see Mary,
our dear Mother, beneath the cross; St. John and Mary Magdalen, with some
other faithful followers of Christ at a short distance from it; associate
yourself with them and study what were their sentiments; try to bring them
home to yourself, and your heart will surely fill up with love, gratitude,
and confidence.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


The feeling of love towards Our Lord must be specially aroused. We are
supposed to have the faith: but we need more love, so that we may
understand why Our Lord underwent such terrible sufferings for poor
humanity. Let us look upon the Lord: He is an innocent, holy person, an
untiring benefactor, a true friend, a wonderful consoler, a man of peace
and of blessings, the noble Son of the great King, the Son of God Himself.
This good Jesus has saved you from eternal damnation. He descended from
heaven and did the work of a miserable slave. And the worst and bitterest
consideration is that you really, individually and personally, are the
cause of the sufferings of Christ. You have struck Him in the face and
spit upon Him, you have crucified Him, you have mocked and derided Him,
and cried out, "Vah; if Thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross."
The Lord, reflecting upon all His sufferings, declared that all this
happened in the house of His beloved ones. What did the Lord do to you,
that you should treat Him in this manner? Now then return Jesus love for
all this, and He will be satisfied.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Sixth Day.


The Jews now began to consult among themselves how to catch Jesus by some
intrigue or other. Our Lord could have avoided the Passion; He might have
prolonged His life, but He wanted to die just then. The machinations of
the Jews could only furnish an occasion for the death of Our Lord, but it
was His own divine will that regulated time, place, and circumstance.
Judas the disciple makes a contract with the high priests that on a
certain night, when the Lord would go out to Gethsemani to pray according
to His custom, the high priests would be ready with their guards to bind
Him. For the miserable price of thirty pieces of silver was the Lord sold,
by a man whom He had befriended so much in His career of public
ministration.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


Let us consider the case of Judas in another reflection and apply it to
ourselves. Judas began as well, perhaps, as any of the other disciples;
but now he is approaching the dreadful abyss of sin into which he fell, as
we know from the Gospel. How much the Lord did for that disciple! By kind
words and patience, He made him understand that though He knew of his
impending fall, still He did not cast him off, but tried to win him back.
When Judas had eaten the morsel which Our Lord had presented to him, the
devil seemed to have entered into him. It was only then that the Lord gave
him up, and bade him go and do quickly what he had in his mind. Now His
mercy is at an end, and with terrible severity Our Lord speaks of the
scandal, and says it would have been better that Judas had never been
born. All this shows that unless we co-operate with the grace which God
almighty offers us, we, too, shall fall into sin, notwithstanding all the
good instruction and good example given us. It shows that if we follow our
own bent of evil intentions, we will go from bad to worse in spite of all
that God has done. There are times of grace that are all-important for us.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Eighth Day.


When the Lord sat at the Last Supper He made all the apostles aware of
their future infidelity. Simon Peter spoke for himself rather than for
all, when he said: "Although all should be scandalized in Thee, I will
not: I am ready to go with Thee, both into prison and to death." Our Lord
foresaw his frailty and corrected him for his presumption, though no doubt
it was well meant at the time, and said to him, "Simon, Simon, behold
Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat." Peter
followed the Lord from afar, to see what the end would be, and entering
the courtyard of the prison, he was accosted by a maid-servant, and before
her and the bystanders he cursed and blasphemed that he "did not know the
man." As in the case of Peter, so Our Lord knows our frailty--that we
cannot stand by ourselves. We ought to distrust ourselves, and remember
how sinful we have been, and now that we stand be careful lest we fall.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Ninth Day.


The Lord called His disciples together in order to eat the Pasch with them
for the last time on earth, and also take a long farewell of them. They
would not meet again until after the resurrection. St. John the Evangelist
gives us much of the discourses which the Lord held with His disciples.
"Let not your heart be disturbed," He says, "at what is going to happen to
Me." The sorrow at parting, and the dreadful suffering which the Master
was to undergo, acted in a most depressing manner on their spirits. No
wonder they felt so downcast. He was their great friend, the joy of their
heart, and now He is about to leave them. It is related that when Jesus
was a boy, His companions felt such consolation in His presence that when
any of them were distressed, they would say, "Let us go to the Son of
Mary; He will console us." Even now Jesus is our great joy and
consolation; now that He is to be found in the Blessed Sacrament, now that
He is in heaven at the right hand of the Father, to Him we can always go,
and find refuge in His kindness.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Tenth Day.


At the Last Supper Our Lord continued His discourse, consoling and
encouraging His disciples by telling them: "In My Father's house there are
many mansions; if not, I would have told you: that I go to prepare a place
for you."--John xiv. 2. Lift up your eyes, My beloved disciples, from this
vale of tears to heaven, where you are to dwell for all eternity. My
separation from you will be but short. I will go to heaven, and where I
am, My faithful servants shall be. This earth is a desert for the one that
loves God; there is no hope of peace and perfect happiness. Eternal joys
are reserved for us in heaven if we are faithful to Jesus, and confide in
Him. Though our sins may be many and great, we will be washed clean in the
blood of the Lamb, and we may still hope to enter the realms prepared for
us by Christ Himself. Resolve now to be noble-hearted in the service of
God, and shrink not from work or suffering.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Eleventh Day.


After the discourse at the Last Supper Jesus takes off His outer garments,
girds Himself with a towel, pours water into a vessel, and approaches
Peter to wash his feet. For this purpose the Lord kneels down and prepares
to wash Peter's feet. Peter is really shocked at this self-abasement; he
revolts at the thought that he should allow this to be done to him by his
divine Master, Whom he had acknowledged, and Whom he knew to be God. Our
Lord practised this out of humility, at this solemn moment just before
parting from His disciples, to show how important this humility is, and to
make a great impression on all of us. We, too, must be humble, and
humiliate ourselves as did Our Lord. We cannot practise virtue without
humility; we cannot enter heaven unless we possess this virtue. He washes
the feet of the apostles just before the two great acts of His life: the
institution of the Blessed Sacrament and the beginning of His sacred
Passion.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Twelfth Day.


Our Lord was determined to perform the ceremony of the washing of the feet
of St. Peter and the apostles. He advised Peter to be obedient, and to
allow the washing to take place, otherwise he would have no part with Him.
When Peter heard this he became very much afraid, and with his usual ardor
he cried out: "Lord, not only my feet, but my head, my whole body." Our
Lord answered: "He that has his feet washed is entirely cleansed. You are
washed clean, still not all." By this, reference was made to the condition
of Judas. Why does the Lord make reference to the washing of the feet?
Because it is the feet that are soiled when we come in contact with the
world; but if our feet do not touch the world, if our hearts are above the
things of this world, we may be sure that we have not contracted any filth
on the soul.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Thirteenth Day.


After the ceremony of the washing of the feet, Our Lord concludes His
discourse by telling His apostles that now He will not say much more to
them, for the prince of this world, Satan, is about to approach to claim a
share in His sacred humanity: but in that He has no part. This He tells
them, that the world may acknowledge that the Son loves His Father, and
that He does all that is required of Him.--John xiv. 30. There are many who
love to sit at the table of the Lord, to be filled with consolation, and
to enjoy the spiritual luxury of His company. But few there are who would
follow Christ to the cross. We must not only love the table of the Lord,
but we must also be with Him in His Passion. We should suffer the trials
sent to us, as good followers of the Lord Jesus. Remain then with the Lord
under all circumstances, whether it be for consolation or bitterness of
suffering. Some of the saints understood this so well that they prayed for
afflictions.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Fourteenth Day.


And now, after the Last Supper, the Lord goes forth with His disciples to
the Garden of Gethsemani, where He is so overcome with fear and sorrow,
that He seems to cling to the society of the apostles for consolation.
Falling down on His face, He prays that the chalice might pass, yet not as
He would, but as the Father willed it. The disciples slept as if they had
lost all sympathy for the Lord. But why is Our Saviour so distressed? Why
is He so downcast? The sins and the consequences of sin appear before Him
so vividly, and He is so overwhelmed with them, that He feels His soul
oppressed unto death. He sees all the misery of humanity, all the cruelty
practised by man, all the ignorance and degradation of the world; and for
this He must suffer, to bring God's mercy again to man. He is to take upon
Himself all the sins of mankind. He is to be degraded to the level of a
slave, to die the same death, and all for us.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Fifteenth Day.


In the terrible agony of Our Lord in the Garden of Gethsemani, the Lord
saw all the sins of mankind. He sees the injustice of man in comparison to
the eternal justice of God. He beholds their ingratitude to His
everlasting love, their obduracy against the sweet mercy of God. This
leprosy of sin has been laid on the Lord, so that, as the Psalmist says:
"The confusion of my face hath covered me."--Ps. xliii. 16. He is filled
with the confusion of shame, because sin is so horrible. His soul is
overwhelmed with bitterness, because sin is so full of malice and insult
to God. Thus covered with our shame, He appears before His heavenly
Father, prone on His face on the ground. The heavenly Father does not
recognize His Son; Jesus prays, but is not heard. The justice of God casts
Him away. He begs the Father for help, but He will not bend His ear to the
supplication of His Son. Jesus waits for consolation, but instead receives
His death sentence. He must drink the cup of sorrow to the very dregs.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Sixteenth Day.


The Lord bade His disciples watch and pray, but hardly has He left them to
themselves than they fall asleep. Judas is not asleep; he is actively
engaged in getting his company together, giving them instructions how to
proceed, so that they might elude the power of the Lord. But the disciples
sleep, and are careless of the Lord's interests. No wonder that the
indifference of the disciples gave Him an additional pang. We, too, are
the disciples of the Lord. Why do we sleep while the enemy is sowing the
seed of error and irreligion? What effect has the instructions, the
counsels of the divine Master, had upon us? They are all forgotten, and we
look to our own comfort and to our pleasures; we go after the world, money
and honors, but think little of God. Let us then watch and pray; the
spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak. The soul would act
otherwise, if the body had not been allowed an almost limitless freedom
while the soul is dying of spiritual starvation. Give your soul an
opportunity to rise above the low necessities of the body, and the spirit
will then be strong to compel the body to obey.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Seventeenth Day.


When Our Lord had prayed and struggled in this mortal agony, He arose and
assembled His disciples about Him, and awaited the coming of the traitor.
And as He was yet speaking, behold, the crowd arrived, and Judas, one of
the twelve, was with them; coming up to Jesus, he kissed Him, and the Lord
said: "Judas, with a kiss you betray the Son of man." Judas thus betrays
the Lord with the sign of friendship. He comes up to Him as of old, when
returning from a missionary tour, he was met by the Lord with open arms,
and he, as well as the other disciples, would tell of their labors, their
successes, and the good they had done. And now, as if to throw the Lord
off His guard, he pretends to have the same spirit within his breast. O
Lord Jesus! with what kindness didst Thou not even then receive Judas,
that he might see that Thou didst still love him. In our frequent
infidelities the Lord comes to us with the same sweetness and goodness. He
would lead us back to our duties and the recognition of our faults. O that
we would listen to the words of Our Lord!

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Eighteenth Day.


When Judas had given that traitorous sign, the kiss of peace, the
disciples all fled. Our Lord had commanded, "If therefore you seek Me, let
these go their way." No sooner had the disciples seen that the Lord
presented His hands to be tied, than they ran off in the greatest hurry.
They had forgotten the assurance they had given that they would remain
faithful. They whose feet had been washed in all humility by Our Lord, Who
had fed them a short time before with His sacred body and blood. We are
not far inferior in infidelity to the disciples. In the morning we have
gone to communion, and before the day is over we have fallen into grievous
sin. We had made many resolutions at our last confession, and at the
approach of the first temptation we have fallen into the same sins again.
We leave, without much concern, Jesus, the best friend we have in this
world. Oh, let us remain faithful to the good Master of our souls, Who,
after this life is over, promises us eternal rewards.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Nineteenth Day.


Then the soldiers came up, and bound the Lord's hands as He willingly
offers them. He makes no opposition whatsoever. He might have continued
the exhibition of His power by which they fell back three times, and He
might have walked away. But the time of the Passion had come, and He
allows the soldiers to have the mastery over Him. Christ has dissolved our
bonds, and He is bound Himself; in fact, by that binding Christ has
merited to loosen us from the slavery of Satan. But Christ was also bound
that we, too, may bind ourselves in the law of God, and be faithful to its
observance all the days of our life. Tie your will to the chains of the
Lord Jesus; honor those chains, yes, even love them, as they are the bonds
of the union between you and Him. Make up your mind to follow Christ, to
be united to Him, and never desire to be freed from this close friendship.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Twentieth Day.


The priests, the high priests and the Pharisees, the great enemies of the
Lord, had held a meeting in expectation of bringing the prisoner for
accusation and condemnation. This was the court to which the innocent
Jesus was dragged; these were all His enemies. They all tried to destroy
Him, and now the opportunity seems to present itself, and they are going
to make the best of it. They are going to condemn Jesus; they encourage
false witnesses, that they may make a show, at least, of the justice of
the condemnation. It is considered necessary to put Jesus out of the way.
"It is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that
the whole nation perish not."--John xii. 50. In all this Our Lord is
silent; not a word does Jesus utter in self-defence. How easily could the
divine wisdom confound human ingenuity, the skill of the lawyers, and the
malice of the high priests. But Jesus held a mysterious silence, in which
we must adore Him.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-first Day.


Peter, the great disciple of Jesus, he to whom the Lord had given so much,
whom He had brought to Mount Thabor, for whom He paid taxes as for
Himself; this Peter denied His Master. When Our Lord had been apprehended,
Peter followed from afar, to see what would be the end of all this
tragedy. He went on at some distance from Our Lord, until he reached the
courtyard, where he could see all that was passing. There, among the
soldiers, servants, and curiosity-seekers, he stood, as if he had no
interest in the affair except that which would bring any stranger there.
They would not have known him, only for a woman who sat in such a way that
the light fell on Peter's face, and she immediately declared, "This man
was with Him." But Peter denied that fact; another and a third asserted
that Peter was with Christ, for he was a Galilean--but Peter denied the
accusation with an oath.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-second Day.


We ought, right here, to think of the reasons of the terrible treason of
Peter. We may suppose that his crime was no smaller than was that of
Judas. We know what was the fate of Judas--what will be the fate of Peter?
The cause of Peter's fall was his presumption. He imagined that he was
strong enough to go to heaven, and to lead a good life without watching or
praying--of course he would go to prison or death with Jesus. Instead of
following the Lord closely, right among the soldiers who apprehended Him,
he followed a long way off, giving as an excuse that he wished to see the
outcome of the affair. He follows, and places himself in the very occasion
of sin. He knew he could not be there long without being detected, but he
resolved to deny, and even to take false oaths to secure himself.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-third Day.


When Peter had thus, with indescribable meanness, denied Our Lord, Jesus
turned and gave him a look of compassion. Then Peter recollected the words
of Jesus, that before the cock would crow he would have denied Him thrice.
Great was the sorrow in the heart of Peter after this look; he remembered
himself, and filled with shame walked out and wept bitterly. This look
which the Lord gave Peter was merciful and kind; so loving that it drew
him back again from the sin into which he had fallen; it encouraged him to
look for forgiveness, and did not drive him to despair. Judas too
acknowledged his sin, but he felt no repentance; he despaired of the great
kindness of God. Instead of throwing himself at the feet of Jesus, he
committed another crime--that of suicide. To Peter came a flood of tears.
There is no doubt that his sorrow for this great offence lasted all his
lifetime; he could not think of the circumstance but the picture of his
infidelity arose before him.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Twenty-fourth Day.


The infidelity of Peter should lead us to think of our own condition. How
often have we sinned? how often have we been unfaithful to Jesus Christ?
how often have we betrayed Him? Did we ever feel the tears of sorrow
gushing from our hearts? and if we did have sorrow and repentance in the
Sacrament of Penance, did we not soon forget it all, as if our faults were
less serious than they really are? Often the Lord looks at us when we are
in sin, often have we felt that His eyes were on us, full of love, of
mercy and goodness; but we were in sin, in the occasion of it, and we
would not give it up even though we added more sorrow to that which Our
Lord was already suffering. Set your hope, however, in the Lord; look up
to Him with pleading eyes, that He may give you the strength, the will,
and the grace to rise from your fall. Say to your sins, and your
companions in sin, go away from me. Yes, our sins more than any other
misfortune should make us despise the world, with all its sinful
allurements.

Pilate put the question to the Lord, "Art Thou the King of the Jews?" He
wanted to hear from Christ's own lips whether He pretended to the earthly
crown of a kingdom, over which the Roman power held sway. But Our Lord had
no kingdom on this earth, and He answered, "For this was I born, and for
this came I into the world, that I should give testimony to the truth."
Pilate did not want to be convinced of the truth, and he answered
indifferently, "What is truth?" The Lord came into this world to spread
the truth of the Gospel; He wished to teach us that truth which makes us
truly free. The Lord wishes to show us the way in which we should walk in
order to reach Him. But the world is not anxious for such enlightenment,
any more than Pilate. For nineteen hundred years the Church of God has
been teaching truth. But the world does not accept the teaching of Jesus
as truth; the world is too proud to receive this humble teaching. And yet
Our Lord's voice rings clear, "Every one that is of the truth, heareth My
voice."

Pilate went out to consult with the Jews, the accusers of Christ, and he
told them that he found no cause of death in Christ. He admitted that
there might be some rebellion which ought to be punished, and that he
would administer a severe punishment and then would set Him free. See Our
Lord, humbly standing before this unjust judge; see the soldiers, as soon
as the order was given, tear off His garments, drag Him over to the column
of marble, and there bind Him. Then they take the stout cords, on the ends
of which are leaden balls with spikes, and whirling them over their heads,
they let them fall cruelly on Christ's shoulders. The blood spurts from
every wound, and soon the place about the column is covered with blood.
The crime of that flagellation was so great that no human words can
express it. In what a dreadful state Our Lord was left after it was
over--how exhausted! From the soles of His feet to the crown of His head
there was no sound spot in Him.

When the Lord had been scourged, the soldiers platted a crown of thorns
and placed it on His head, pressing it down, striking the crown with
sticks that they might save their hands from wounds, and then they put a
purple garment on Him. All this was done to mock Him, because He said He
was a king: the crown of royalty He bore on His head, and the purple
garment which kings generally wore covered His body. They carried out
their derision still farther; they bent their knees before Him, and having
blindfolded Him, they struck Him in the face, asking Him to point out who
was the one that had given Him the blow. O loving face of Jesus! upon
which the angels desired to gaze; look with pity on poor humanity that
dost treat Thee so cruelly; look with pity on our inordinate desires to
satisfy the demands of our passions. Ah, Thou knowest who hast heaped
these insults upon Thee! In Thy omnipresence Thou seest the sins which we
commit. The Jews, indeed, treated Thee as a mock king, and like a fool,
whilst poor mankind in its ignorance hast prepared all these torments for
Thee.

Pilate must have witnessed much of this cruelty, as it was inflicted right
in his court, with his consent, perhaps even by his orders. What a
frightful spectacle it was to look upon this figure of a man, scourged
almost beyond recognition, with a crown of thorns on His head, bound, and
a cloak thrown over His shoulders. Pilate thought that this spectacle
would render the Jews merciful, that the punishment had been sufficient.
So he led Our Lord over an archway and placed Him in full view of the
assembled multitude, saying: "Behold the man!" Yes, O Christian heart,
look at the Lord exhausted after the scourging, the crown of thorns on His
head, clotted blood in His face, burning with a fever heat, ready to die
from loss of blood. O my Jesus, what sufferings didst Thou not endure to
satisfy the cruelty of man! Thou hast become a spectacle before God and
the world. But the Jews were hardened. The sight of Christ in this
condition did not move them. They cried, "Away with Him, away with Him,
crucify Him."

When the Jews demanded the death of Christ so vehemently, Pilate had water
brought to him, in which he washed his hands, as a sign that he was
innocent of the great crime of condemning Our Lord to the death of the
cross. Still he condemned Him, and wrote the inscription of the cross
himself. The Lord was led out to be crucified. St. Catharine of Emmerich
saw in a vision the rapture with which Jesus received the cross. That He
knelt down and addressed the wood with loving words. It was the
consummation of the Lord's desires. His whole aim in life was that He
should die on the cross, so now He stretches out His arms to receive that
precious burden, the seat of His love, the instrument of His mercy, and
the sign of triumph. Dear cross! no longer are you the wood of disgrace on
which malefactors are to die; you are now the sign of glory. No longer are
you the accursed wood, but the glory of the elect. Cross and altar are now
the same thing to us; the altar is our joy and happiness, so also is the
cross. The Christian who has no love for the cross is to be pitied.

Thirtieth Day.


The Lord takes the holy cross on His shoulders, at the foot of Calvary,
and carries it up to the summit. What a journey that was, full of sorrow
and pain! He falls several times; He meets His holy Mother on the way and
exchanges some words of consolation with her. He meets the weeping women
of Jerusalem, and bids them weep over themselves and over their children.
Simon the Cyrenean is compelled to help carry the heavy weight of the
cross. Veronica, a devout woman, offers a handkerchief, that the Lord may
wipe His sacred countenance. Two malefactors are also to be crucified with
the Saviour. He does not despise their company: He wished to be numbered
among the most abject of sinners, for He carries in His cross all the sins
of mankind. He has to make reparation to the heavenly Father for them all.
At this sight let us no longer grumble at our crosses, but let us bear
them lovingly and cheerfully.

Thirty-first Day.


After terrible exertion in consequence of His exhaustion, loss of blood,
want of food and rest, Our Lord arrives at the summit of Mount Calvary,
called Golgotha, the place of execution, the mount of skulls. Our Lord
would have died in consequence of the terrible punishment He had received,
only the power of His heavenly Father kept Him alive. Arriving on the
spot, His clothes are cruelly torn off His sacred body, the wounds are
reopened and bleed afresh. He kneels down, and at the command of His
executioners He extends His arms and feet to the places to which they were
to be attached. The soldiers take nails and hammers, and drive nails into
the palms of His hands, fixing them to the cross; then His feet are nailed
also. When all this has been done they raise the cross to an erect
position and set it in the ground. Mary, the Mother of Jesus, is present;
she hears the strokes of the hammer--every sound pierces her heart. O
Mother of sorrows! make me feel the dreadful crucifixion in my soul;
divide thy sorrows with me. Mary Magdalen, the penitent woman, hastens to
the foot of the cross. St. John, the beloved disciple, is there also.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Thirty-second Day.


The executioners then sat down before the cross, and watched Our Lord.
They played dice for His garments; it was their sinful perquisite to take
possession of anything that a dying criminal left. Our Lord was poor and
had nothing but His garments, and these were accordingly distributed. Our
Lord hung on the cross; not a word had so far passed His lips;
uncomplaining, sunk in deep prayer, the sacrifice of the cross was going
on for our sins, the Lamb of God was on the slaughter bench, pouring forth
His blood without giving a sign of pain. He hangs between two murderers.
He is not distinguished from them in misery, except that He prays and they
blaspheme. The Jews now celebrate their triumph; they are gathered about
in knots, mocking and laughing. They invite Him to descend from the cross:
that then they would believe in Him. Jesus still wears the crown of
thorns, and over His head, attached to the wood, are the words: "Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the Jews."

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Thirty-third Day.


The first words which Our Lord utters after a long silence, are words of
mercy, and a prayer for forgiveness: "Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do." Jesus prays for His enemies, for His executioners,
before He speaks a word of comfort to His holy Mother. He looks for no
revenge, casts no threats at them, does not complain of their inhuman
conduct. He only thinks that by His prayer He may save them. In the
meantime the thief on His right acknowledges his faults, defends the Lord,
and begs for mercy, which he receives on the spot with a promise of being
with Christ in paradise on that very day. The centurion also acknowledges
the divinity of Christ, and many who are around the cross strike their
breasts, and are converted. Now that the sacrifice had been offered Jesus
sees His Mother at the foot of the cross, and the disciple whom He loved.
Turning to Mary He said "Woman, behold thy son," and to the disciple,
"behold thy Mother," and from that hour John, as a dutiful son, took Mary
under his protection.

Thirty-fourth Day.


After Our Lord had hung on the cross for three hours, a great darkness
came over the whole universe. The sun refused to give light. Amid this
weird darkness and silence Our Lord completes His sacrifice. When the
world seems to desert you, and the horror of God's vengeance appears to
surround you, take heart, raise your eyes to Jesus crucified, and pray Him
to strengthen you in patience and endurance until the darkness is over,
and you can again find comfort in God's mercy. The Apostle Paul tells us
that Jesus, in the days of His flesh, poured forth prayers and
supplications with a great cry, and was heard out of reverence.--Heb. v. 7.
So the sacrifice of Christ was accepted, and the debt which you owed for
your sins was expiated on the cross. You need no longer be afraid that
your wretchedness will bring on you eternal damnation; by the merits of
this sacred Passion you have a hope that you may enter into eternal glory.

"I thirst." The greatest affliction Our Lord had to endure on the cross
was the thirst. The fever after loss of blood and the severe and cruel
sufferings, the torments of a whole night, had dried up the moisture of
His body. "My strength is dried up like a potsherd," was said of Him by
the Prophet: "and My tongue hath cleaved to My jaws."--Ps. xxi. 16. We
honor this holy thirst by abstaining during Lent from all intoxicating
drink, and many souls have received great blessings from God for this
veneration. It is the intention that ennobles the act, and the smallest
offering accompanied by a good will pleases God. Our Lord suffered this
thirst to atone for our sins, that we might not go to hell, where we would
thirst for all eternity. Remember Dives in the Gospel, who begged for one
drop of water to be placed on his tongue. Our Lord, dying with thirst,
yearned for the salvation of your soul. This was the thirst symbolized by
His bodily thirst.

At last the hour has come, in which Jesus considers that He has made
reparation to His heavenly Father for all the sins of mankind. The chalice
has been drained--all possible humiliation had been heaped upon Him. Jesus
cried, "It is consummated." All the work of salvation is now at an end.
All the sufferings that the Father has ordained in His eternal providence
have been undergone. "The work which Thou gavest me, I have performed."
The work of grace is accomplished. About the ninth hour, Our Lord cried
out, with a loud voice, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" The
Father had demanded the death of the Son. He must be exterminated with the
most cruel torments; nothing less than death will satisfy the Father. He
turns to the Father for one look of kindness, but He receives none, until
that hated human flesh has been punished.

Prayer.

Thirty-seventh Day.


O my dear Jesus, Thou art altogether forsaken; there is nothing from which
Thou canst gather consolation and support. Even in the hour of death Thou
dost enter the portals of the other world without one friendly face before
Thine eyes. Yes, Thou art forsaken; Thy strength, the assistance of Thy
Father, the light of Thine eyes, Thy holy Mother, hath no consolation for
Thee. The people that stood around the cross did not know what that great
cry meant. Only Jesus knew it. He felt it. How few people understand the
language of divine love! Who could think that the Father would desert His
Son, and would not be satisfied but with the most extreme punishment! We
should sympathize with Our Lord in His cruel abandonment, we who have been
the cause of this agony. Our Lord suffers the same feeling of desertion
when we do not visit Him in the Blessed Sacrament. Let it be our joy, our
pastime, our recreation, to go to Him, and to thank Him for His great love
for us.

Prayer.

Look down upon me, good and gentle Jesus, etc., etc.



Thirty-eighth Day.


The last words which Our Lord uttered were, "Father, into Thy hands I
commend My spirit." Again Jesus calls God His Father. God has accepted the
sacrifice, and has taken His divine Son to His bosom, hence the Lord calls
Him Father. The sacred countenance of Jesus takes on the pallor of death,
the lips are parted and the last breath is gone. His soul has flown to the
Father; the adorable spirit of Jesus has entered the realms of eternal
bliss, where He is joyfully received. Jesus is dead, but by the infinite
merits of His death and Passion He has freed us from death. Jesus is dead,
but by His death we have become children of God. Jesus is dead, but we
acknowledge Him to be our good Lord, our Master and our King. The death of
Christ is our life, but we must exterminate sin, and let the love of Jesus
flame up in our hearts.

Prayer.

Thirty-ninth Day.


"It is consummated." All the sufferings of Our Lord are now over. The
depth of humiliation has been reached, the bitter chalice has been
drained, the soul of Jesus has left the body, and the body is dead. How
often, dear Jesus, have I tried to shake off the cross which God has
imposed on me! I, too, ought to remain fixed to the cross, until all is
over and the soul leaves my body. The fact is that I have not the virtue
of perseverance, that sister virtue of patience, which protects our
sanctity. I ought to be able to say with Our Lord, "The work which I was
to do is completed." The day will come when I, and the whole world, will
see the mystery of my crosses: when I shall see clearly the purpose for
which I had to bear them. Give me the grace, gracious Jesus, that I may
welcome that day, because I am conscious that I have done my duty. With
the consummation of the work will also come my reward.

Fortieth Day.


When Our Lord had given up the ghost great events took place, that struck
terror to the hearts of those who witnessed them, and which were told from
mouth to mouth. The great veil of the Temple, behind which stood the holy
of holies, was rent. A terrible earthquake shook the earth, so that the
rocks were burst asunder. The graves opened and men buried for years came
forth and stalked about the streets of the city. Then the centurion, who
stood beneath the cross and witnessed these supernatural manifestations,
exclaimed to those who stood by him that truly this must have been the Son
of God. The soldier saw that all was over, and he had but one duty more to
perform before he could go away: that of piercing the Heart of Jesus with
the lance. Then they took the body of the Lord from the cross, and laid it
for a moment in the arms of Mary. Preparations were made by Joseph of
Arimathea and Nicodemus for the burial; hurried preparations, for it was
the eve of the Pasch. They laid the body in the tomb, whence, on Easter
Sunday, Jesus rose triumphantly.

"Perhaps darkness shall cover me."--Ps. cxxxix. 11.

At The Memento For The Dead


    reflect on the infinite mercy of God towards those who fear Him,
    and pray for those holy souls who have departed this life
    according to His justice, and in the one true faith.


_Affection._

O Jesus, "enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of
death."--Luke i. 79.

At The Pater Noster


    meditate upon the seven words of Christ uttered by Him upon the
    cross: 1, Christ prayed for His enemies; what dost thou do? 2, The
    thief, repenting, obtained heaven; learn seriously to repent and
    do penance, but delay it not to the last. 3, Christ commends His
    Mother to St. John, and St. John to His Mother; to whom canst thou
    better commend thyself? 4, Christ complains that He is forsaken;
    and dost thou expect consolation as thy right? 5, Christ thirsted
    for thy salvation; and dost thou turn away from it with loathing?
    6, Christ announced that all His torments were finished; thus
    shall all thy good and evil in this world be brought to a close.
    7, Lastly, after the example of Christ, commend thy spirit into
    the hands of thy heavenly Father.--Luke xxiii. 46.

At The Division Of The Sacred Host


    reflect upon the separation of Christ's soul from His body.--Matt.
    xxvii. 50. It is appointed unto men once to die.--Heb. ix. 27.

At The Agnus Dei,


    when the priest strikes his breast, reflect how many of those who
    saw Christ dying on the cross, striking their breasts
    returned.--Luke xxiii. 48. And dost not thou strike thy breast in
    token of true sorrow for thy sins?


_Affections._

Lord, I strike my breast with the publican, and say, "Be merciful to me a
sinner."--Luke xviii. 13.

remember my offences, nor those of my parents."--Tob. iii. 3.

_Prayer at the Conclusion of Mass._

Accept, O Holy Trinity, this sacrifice of the body and blood of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, which I have offered to Thy divine majesty in remembrance of
His Passion and death; and by His infinite merits I beseech Thee that all
my defects and negligences may be supplied, for He is the propitiation for
our sins. Amen.

A Prayer to Jesus Suffering.


O spotless Lamb! O innocent Victim, Who, by Thy death and blood, hast
effaced the sins of mankind, blot out my iniquities, and do not permit
that Thy sufferings should become useless to me. O Jesus, abandoned by
every one, sorrowful, desolate, and resigned to death! help me now to
receive with resignation like Thine, whatever afflictions Thou shalt
please to send me. O Jesus, calumniated, accused, despised! teach me to
disregard the judgments of men, and to suffer with patience the most base
injuries. O Jesus, torn with stripes, pierced with thorns, weltering in
blood for my sake! teach me to endure for love of Thee, the anguish and
inconvenience of ill-health and sickness. O Jesus, abandoned to
executioners, shamefully condemned to a cross! enable me to fly all
vainglory, and embrace the most humbling confusion. O Jesus, sinking under
the weight of Thy cross! I unite myself to Thee, and my cross also to
Thine. May I ever carry it with the same strength and courage which Thou
didst. O Jesus, raised upon Thy cross! draw me now powerfully to Thee.
Thou art expiring for my sake. Oh, let me never live but for Thine! that
being henceforth crucified with Thee, my whole occupation may be to love,
to praise, and to adore Thee. Amen.




Prayers to the Five Wounds of Our Lord.


To The Wound Of The Left Foot.

O my divine Saviour! I humbly adore the sacred wound of Thy left foot, and
I feelingly compassionate the intense pain it caused Thee. I thank Thee
for the love with which Thou didst make Thy painful journey to Calvary,
marking every step of the way with Thy precious blood. I offer to the
eternal Father the love and sufferings of Thy holy humanity, in expiation
of my crimes, which I detest with sincere and bitter contrition.

Our Father, etc. Hail Mary, etc. Glory be to the Father, etc.

O holy Mother, impress deeply on my heart the wounds of my crucified
Jesus.

To The Wound Of The Right Foot.

O my divine Saviour! I adore the sacred wound of Thy right foot, and I
feelingly compassionate the intense pain it caused Thee. I thank Thee for
the love with which Thou didst suffer Thy sacred feet to be pierced, and
with barbarous cruelty nailed to the cross, to atone for my wanderings,
and for the guilty indulgence of my disorderly passions. I offer to the
eternal Father the love and sufferings of Thy holy humanity. I beseech Him
to grant me the grace to weep bitterly for my sins, and to persevere in
virtue to the end of my life, without ever straying from the obedience due
to Thy holy commandments.

Our Father, etc. Hail Mary, etc. Glory be to the Father, etc.

O holy Mother, impress deeply on my heart the wounds of my crucified
Jesus.

I feelingly compassionate the intense pain it caused Thee. I thank Thee
for having thereby, with so much love, delivered me from the eternal
punishments which my sins deserve. I offer to the eternal Father the love
and sufferings of Thy holy humanity. I beseech Him to grant me the grace
to profit by the remainder of my life, that I may bring forth fruits
worthy of penance, and thus disarm the divine justice provoked by my
repeated sins.

Our Father, etc. Hail Mary, etc. Glory be to the Father, etc.

O holy Mother, impress deeply on my heart the wounds of my crucified
Jesus.

To The Wound Of The Right Hand.

O my divine Saviour! I adore the sacred wound of Thy right hand, and I
feelingly compassionate the intense pain it caused Thee. I thank Thee for
all the blessings which this bountiful hand has so abundantly bestowed on
me, notwithstanding my ingratitude in refusing to correspond with Thy
gracious designs. I offer to the eternal Father the love and sufferings of
Thy holy humanity. I beseech Him to change my heart and affections, and to
render all my actions conformable to His holy will.

Our Father, etc. Hail Mary, etc. Glory be to the Father, etc.

O holy Mother, impress deeply on my heart the wounds of my crucified
Jesus.

To The Wound Of The Opened Side.

O my divine Saviour! I humbly adore the sacred wound of Thy opened side. I
am exceedingly moved at this cruel outrage. I thank Thee for the love with
which Thou didst suffer Thy side to be pierced and Thy Heart opened, to
give us even the last drop of Thy precious blood that our redemption might
be most abundant. I offer to the eternal Father both this outrage offered
to Thy holy humanity, and the love with which Thou art always ready to
receive the greatest of sinners, that my soul may be received into this
most loving Heart and may abide therein forever. Amen.

Our Father, etc. Hail Mary, etc. Glory be to the Father, etc.

O holy Mother, impress deeply on my heart the wounds of my crucified
Jesus.





MAY. THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY.


We are now on the eve of the beautiful month of Mary--this blessed month so
ardently looked for by every true Christian. On its approach we see the
altars of our blessed Mother in churches, chapels, and oratories
decorated, and everywhere during this lovely month exercises in honor of
the beloved Mother of Our Redeemer are performed with more or less pomp
and ceremony. Mary is our heavenly Mother, and we are her children. What
well-trained child but is anxious to express his love and gratitude
towards his mother, in order to make her happy? What mother so worthy of
love as Mary? Do you wish to please her? This month gives you an
opportunity of so doing. Dedicate it to her, practise daily some little
act of devotion in her honor, and be faithful in making these meditations.
Then only will you deserve to be called a child of Mary. O immaculate
Mary, Mother of our Jesus, and our Mother! also obtain that we may give
thee most fervent homage during this month, and by our words and example
draw all hearts to thee and thy divine Son.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day. Mary's Immaculate Conception.


"Thou art all fair, O My love, and there is not a spot in thee."--Cant. iv.
7. These words are found in the Canticles of Solomon, and are applied to
the Blessed Virgin. From all eternity she had been predestined to be the
Mother of God, to give to the almighty God that body, that flesh and
blood, which He was to assume for our redemption, and the creature that He
selected for His Mother must have been all pure, all holy, and free from
the slightest taint of sin. A few saints, such as John the Baptist and the
prophet Jeremias, were sanctified in their mother's womb. And if these
men, because of their predestination, were born without sin, surely it
cannot be supposed that God did not bestow on Mary a greater
privilege--that He exempted her from the necessity of being even for one
instant the slave of sin. O Mother mine, O Mother of the Church of God, I
hail thee! Have pity on us, O Mary conceived without sin, and obtain for
us the grace to struggle against our passions.

Prayer.

O holiest and purest of virgins, well dost thou merit this title! Thou who
wast a virgin although a mother, pray for us. Take pity on us, thy
children; intercede for us with Jesus, that He may have mercy on us, and
grant us the grace to walk worthy of our vocation, that we may be His
through time and eternity. Amen.



Second Day. Mary's Nativity.


The whole earth was filled with gladness at the birth of Mary, because of
her was to be born Jesus Christ, Our Saviour and Redeemer, Who was to
deliver us from the slavery of the devil. How heaven must have rejoiced at
the birth of such a mother! A nation's joy at the birth of an heir to the
throne may give you some faint idea of the joy the angels experienced at
Mary's nativity. This is a day of jubilation for the entire world, for the
just and the sinner, for time and eternity. Hell alone is afraid, for this
is the woman destined to crush the serpent's head. Her appearance was the
blessed dawn, announcing the rising of the Sun of righteousness. Made holy
at her conception, the object of God's love at her birth, every step in
Mary's life was marked by new progress in virtue; no shadow of sin ever
tarnished the beauty of her soul. Let us then praise our Mother and Queen,
and implore her to take pity on us, whose lives are passed in a constant
struggle against the world, the flesh, and the devil. Let us beg her to
aid us in these combats, and to bring us to our eternal home.

Prayer.

What relief do I feel in my miseries, and what consolation in my sorrow!
what strength do I not find in the midst of temptations, when I remember
thee, and call thee to my aid! O my most sweet and holy Mother Mary, my
own Mother, do thou console me! I see myself loaded with sins and
surrounded with enemies, without virtue, and cold in my love towards God.
Comfort me, and let me begin a new life, a life which will be pleasing to
thy divine Son and to thee. Amen.



Third Day. Mary's Presentation.


Who is she that advances as the sun, beautiful as Jerusalem? It is Mary,
the well-beloved daughter of the Father, who repairs to the Temple of
Jerusalem to consecrate herself to the service of God. Happy he who gives
himself to God in his youth, who offers Him a heart which has not been
wounded by the thorns on life's weary way, a heart which has not known the
state of sin. He has not to struggle against the memories of the past,
which strive to draw him from the service of God. How beautiful, how
filled with sweetest instruction for us, is every passage in the life of
our beloved Mother! Let us look at the picture now presented to us of the
infant Queen of saints, on the day of her early entrance into the Temple
of God. Let us follow her, and learn our first lesson from our little
Queen, so full of grace. See her as she passes up the long flight of
stairs, the little arms folded above the pure young heart, the upturned
face glowing with heavenly joy--a face where lies reflected the light of a
soul which never for a moment was shrouded in the gloomy shadow of sin.

Prayer.

O Lord, Thou wilt not reject a contrite and humble heart! I come then to
Thee, O my Father. At the sight of my bruised and bleeding heart Thou wilt
have compassion on Thy child, and receive my offering. Blooming rose,
Mother of God all beautiful, Virgin most sweet, pray for us, that we may
be worthy to find eternal happiness in eternal light. Grant that by thy
intercession our sins may be effaced. Amen.



Fourth Day. The Annunciation.


God sent His archangel, St. Gabriel, one of the great ones of His kingdom,
to impart to the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady, His eternal counsel, and to ask
her consent. The archangel went to Nazareth, and before the rising of the
sun entered the oratory where the Blessed Virgin was, and beholding in her
his Queen, he saluted her with such reverence that she was overcome with
fear, not knowing what to think. We know how the heavenly messenger bowed
before his Queen and said, "Fear not, Mary; the Lord is with thee, for
thou hast found grace before God. Behold thou shalt conceive and bring
forth a Son, and thou shalt call His name, Jesus." And we know when that
young maiden, bowing her head in her heavenly humility, consented, saying,
"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done unto me according to Thy
word," that the Holy Ghost overshadowed her, and "the Word was made
flesh." Truly she is blessed among all women, blessed among all mothers.
By her blessedness all women are raised and ennobled. She is their honor,
their glory, their model. Blessed Virgin and Mother, ever immaculate on
earth as now in heaven, where she leads the army of virgins who follow the
Lamb whithersoever He goeth. Think of Mary raised above all women, and see
her wonderful humility. God loved her for it. The one thought of her life,
the one end of her actions, was truly to be the handmaid of God. This is a
lesson we all must learn, namely: to yield ourselves up to the will of Him
Whose we are already by so many titles, wondering how He can forget the
sins we have committed against Him, and how He can desire to pour His
celestial grace into so unworthy a vessel.

Prayer.

May Thy will, O God, be done in us, through us, and by us, this day and
always, here and everywhere! Hail, glorious Mother of God; hail, Queen of
heaven; hail, my patroness! To thy tender maternal love I commend myself,
in order that all my actions may have for their end three things, namely,
the glory of thy Son, my own salvation, and my neighbor's good. In every
tribulation and sorrow come to my aid and the aid of my friends. Amen.



Fifth Day. The Visitation.


No sooner had Mary heard the words of the angel, announcing that she had
been chosen to be the Mother of the long expected Messias, and that her
kinswoman Elizabeth was also with child, than she rose up and went with
haste into the hill country, and entering into the house of Zachary,
saluted Elizabeth. Her heart was full of unselfish love for God and man,
and the very love of God which made her heart burn with joy at the coming
of Jesus, made it also beat quickly with gladness at the great blessing
granted to Elizabeth. The angel had told Zachary that his son John was to
be the immediate precursor of the Messias, and Elizabeth had been
constantly thinking of all this, longing to know when and whence the
Messias should come. Lost in these thoughts she sat on the day of Mary's
arrival, and the instant that sweet voice struck on her ear, it was made
known to her in a wonderful manner that this was the Mother of the
Messias. Rising, she knelt before her, crying, "Blessed art thou among
women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me,
that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?" For a moment Mary stood in
astonishment--then she realized the greatness of her title of Mother of
God, and while the light of ecstasy transfigured her holy face, she
exclaimed, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in
God my Saviour. Because He hath regarded the humility of His handmaid: for
behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. Because He
that is mighty hath done great things to me: and holy is His name. And His
mercy is from generation unto generations to them that fear Him. He hath
shewed might in His arm: He hath scattered the proud in the conceit of
their heart. He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted
the humble. He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich He
hath sent empty away. He hath received Israel His servant, being mindful
of His mercy. As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed
forever." The visit which occasioned this beautiful canticle preaches in
every line the great virtue of charity which marked Our Lady's life so
clearly. The Holy Scripture tells us that Mary remained with Elizabeth for
three months, when she returned to her own home.

Prayer.

O Virgin most fair, worthy of all praise and honor! Sanctuary consecrated
to God, Virgin Mother, hidden treasure of innocence, splendor of
virginity! Thy prayers are favorably received on high. Address them for us
to Him, Whom in thy virginity thou didst conceive, Who is true Lord and
God, the Author of all creatures. Amen.



Sixth Day. The Birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ.


And when the fulness of time was come, "God so loved the world as to give
His only-begotten Son," Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down
from heaven, was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was
made man. The Emperor Augustus ordered that a great census should be taken
in all the provinces of his empire, each family being enrolled in the city
of its respective tribe. Thus, in obedience to the order, Mary came to the
city of David, and in all its length and breadth there was not room for
her to lay her weary head. "He came unto His own, and His own received Him
not." Gold would doubtless have procured admission to an appropriate
shelter, but Joseph had no gold. The evening wind fell cold and piercing
on the young virgin, who breathed not a word of complaint though she was
scarcely able to support herself. The lonely travellers, seeing themselves
rejected by all the world, quitted Bethlehem, and in a poor ruined stable
Mary brought forth her first-born Son, the promised Messias, and laid Him
in a manger. Great artists have striven to paint the rapture of Mary as
she laid her Jesus, her Son, her God, in the manger. Who can understand
what it was to see Him, to adore Him as her God, to caress Him as her
Child, to forget all her fatigue in her wonderful joy? We can adore Him
and watch the movements of our beloved Mother, a model and example of
resignation on this night of poverty and humiliation. Glory and praise to
thee, O holy Mother, in this thy poverty in Bethlehem! Many a poor mother
in sorrow and want will look to thee and find consolation, knowing thy
tender heart will sympathize with her. For what are we that we should be
better treated than the Mother of Our God?

Prayer.

Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, receive my prayer. Help me in all my
necessities, intercede for me, O glorious one, with my Redeemer, even with
Him, thy divine Son, Whom thou didst bear without spot of sin. Deliver me
from every snare of the enemy, and from all carnal delights, that by thy
intercession I may obtain the pardon of all my sins, steadfast resistance
to all my enemies visible and invisible, and the amendment of my life.
Amen.



Seventh Day. The Purification.


It was ordered by the Law of Moses that all women should, at a stated time
after childbirth, repair to the Temple and present themselves to the
priest, in order that they might be purified. Could she who had been
immaculately conceived, an immaculate Virgin and Mother, be made more
pure? No, certainly not; but obedience required that she should comply
with the conditions of the Law, and obedience was one of Mary's greatest
virtues. Should not her example fill us with confusion--we who are apt to
murmur against any command that is in the slightest manner distasteful to
our feelings? The Law also commanded that every first-born son should be
offered to God in the Temple, and then ransomed by some gift, according to
the condition of the parents. Mary and Joseph were poor, so they took
their humble offering of two doves and set out for Jerusalem, to present
the Son of God in the Temple. As Mary walked on, with her precious Child
clasped in her arms, how little the passers-by suspected Who this first-
born Son was! If they could have only known what He was to do for His
people, how they would have bowed before Him and adored Him, poor weak
Infant as He was! But no, "He came unto His own, and His own knew Him
not." "And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man
was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy
Ghost was in him. And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that
he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. And he
came by the Spirit into the Temple. And when His parents brought in the
Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the Law: he took Him
into his arms, and blessed God, and said: Now Thou dost dismiss Thy
servant, O Lord, according to Thy word in peace: Because my eyes have seen
Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples. A
light to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people,
Israel." As Simeon stands thus with the Babe in his arms, the Holy Ghost
shows him the sad, sad future of the Child and Mother. Turning to Mary, he
said: "Behold this Child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of
many in Israel.... And thy own soul a sword shall pierce." Oh, the awful
sorrow that fell on her young heart! For a moment she bowed down under the
crushing burden of her coming pain, but only for a moment; then she
stretches out her arms to receive her Child, and murmurs, "Thy will, not
mine, be done; be it done unto me according to Thy word." What a lesson
for us to learn, we who are restless and impatient under every little
trial! What a contrast to our disobedience and pride when God wishes to
take some loved object from us! Oh, let the example of this most perfect
of women sink deeply into our hearts, and may we learn from her the great
virtues of charity, obedience, humility, and purity.

Prayer.

O Mother of mercy, forsake us not in our hour of trial and temptation!
Never allow us to lose courage, but cheer us with thy aid, make us patient
under suffering, and render our wills conformable to the will of thy
divine Son. Conduct us through the dawn of penance to the fulness of thy
light. Amen.



Eighth Day. Simeon's Prophecy.


The holy Simeon had foretold that Jesus should be a stumbling block to
many. By these words Mary understood that Jesus would suffer much
persecution from the Jews, and her immaculate heart was deluged with
sorrow. She saw Anna come into the Temple and heard her acknowledge Jesus
as her God. She obeyed everything which the Law ordained, and then with
Joseph and her Child returned to the city of Nazareth, with the sharp
sword of sorrow within her heart. Oh, the constant grief that followed
each ray of joy that lighted her soul! How she suffered at every insult
offered to her divine Son--she who loved Him as no other mother ever loved
a child! Every look at Jesus, every movement that He made, every word He
spoke, brought to her mind the prophecy of Simeon and filled her heart
with bitterness. The memory of those words were always before her, and as
time passed on she saw Gethsemani and Calvary hourly drawing nearer and
nearer. The words of the prophet Isaias came whispering to her heart, "He
shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and shall be dumb as a lamb
before His shearer, and He shall not open His mouth." Yet ever and anon
she murmured, "Thy will, not mine, be done." Oh, what an example of loving
resignation to the will of God! It is astonishing how shallow all human
consolation is. Let Our Lady teach us how to suffer without seeking
consolation. She suffered in silence; we can make our sorrows in a measure
like hers by constantly uniting them to the sorrows of our dearest Lord.
With confidence then we may seek the Mother of sorrows, and ask her to be
the Mother of our sorrow, to help us bear our burdens to the very end--to
be like her, loving and patient with those who cause us pain. It is a
consolation to those who mourn to know that our blessed Lady was a
lifelong mourner. So let us take up our sorrow bravely, and following in
the footsteps of our dear Mother, walk cheerfully on.

Prayer.

O Mary, Mother of sorrows, my refuge, neglect not to pray for me in all my
tribulations! First of all in the blood of Jesus Christ, then in thy
prayers, do I trust for my eternal salvation. In thee, O Lady, have I
hoped; I will say to thee with St. Bonaventure, "I shall not be confounded
forever." Obtain for me the grace to love my God in this life and in
eternity, and I ask for nothing more. Amen.



Ninth Day. The Flight into Egypt.


Filled with joy and praising God, the Magi left the stable with the
intention of going to Herod, so that he might share in the happiness. But
an angel appeared to them, warning them not to return to Herod, for he
sought to destroy the Christ, the new-born Messias, so they turned their
camels' heads and went another way into their own country. Herod did not
intend, however, to be deprived of his Victim, and lest he should miss
taking the life of the new-born King, he gave orders that all the children
of two years and under in and around Bethlehem should be killed. While
Herod is thus plotting the Infant's death, an angel appears to Joseph in a
dream, to warn him, saying, "Rise, take the Child and His Mother and fly
into Egypt: and be there until I shall tell thee. For it will come to pass
that Herod will seek the Child that he may destroy Him." Joseph and Mary
immediately obeyed the command, for poverty has but few preparations to
make. Not a murmur or complaint escaped their lips, though our hearts can
imagine how difficult it must have been for Mary to leave home again, and
to face the hardships of the wilderness. Trembling with apprehension from
the dread of Herod's followers, and suffering from heat and cold in their
severest forms, they travelled on for many a weary day. But God had so
ordained it, and they were ready to do His holy will. What a lesson of
perfect obedience! They knew that they were carrying Jesus, yet they did
not look for miracles to lighten their burden. We may reverently follow
them on their journey in our meditations. Tradition tells us of trees that
bowed down their leafy heads to shade with their fan-like plumes the
Mother and her Child. It also tells us that the images of the heathen gods
fell from their pedestals when the true God went by. And there, amid the
Egyptian idolaters, Mary, the frail, girlish Mother, and Joseph, so
patient and uncomplaining, with the holy Babe dwelt for seven years.
Joseph pursued his trade of carpenter, and Mary no doubt contributed her
share to the support of the modest household, while Jesus grew in beauty
day after day. When Herod died an angel came to Joseph, saying, "Arise,
and return into Judea, for they who sought the life of the Child are
dead." This was glad news to Mary and Joseph, and joyfully they returned
to commence anew their life in Nazareth of Galilee.

Prayer.

Hail, Mother of mercy, Queen of heaven, thou art our life, our sweetness,
and our hope! Obtain for me the grace of the Holy Ghost, that He may
dispose of me in all things according to His will, that He may direct my
body, elevate my soul, guide my life, rule my conduct, inspire my actions,
maintain within me holy thoughts, pardon my sins of the past, correct
those of the present, and preserve me from sin in the future. Amen.



Tenth Day. The Three Days' Loss.


From the time of the return from Egypt, history is silent as to the life
of the Holy Family, until the time when they went to keep the Easter
festival at Jerusalem. According to the Law, the Jews were obliged to go
up to Jerusalem to worship God three times a year, unless they were
legitimately hindered. The first time was at the Pasch, instituted in
remembrance of the exodus from Egypt, and corresponding to our Easter; the
second time was the feast of weeks, which was Pentecost or Whitsuntide;
the third was the feast of tabernacles. St. Luke, in his gospel, gives us
this account of the occurrence: "When Jesus was twelve years old, they
went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast." Unknown and
unnoticed, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph passed into the holy city. Mary's heart
was filled with joy at the thought that she was leading to the Temple
God's only Son made man. As she looked at the surging crowd around her
both within and without the Temple, she thought to herself, "Ah, if you
could but know that this Boy, Whom you think is only the son of a
carpenter, is the Son of the most high God! He is your King." But the week
of unleavened bread came to a close. Thousands as usual had thronged the
holy city to worship God. After the festival was over, the custom was that
all the women should depart by one gate of the city, the men by another,
in order to reunite at the halting-place of the first night. The children
might go either with the father or with the mother. Thus it was that Mary
and Joseph travelled on contentedly, Mary thinking that Jesus was with
Joseph, while Joseph on his side supposed the Child to be with His Mother.
The night had fallen before the two bands of men and women met; imagine
the consternation of the holy parents when they discovered the absence of
their precious charge. They asked among their kinsfolk and acquaintances
if He were with them, but Mary knew it would be all in vain. She knew if
He were in the company He would long since have joined her; so in all
haste, alone and silent, Mary and Joseph retraced their steps to the holy
city. For three days they searched in sorrow for their loved Child; they
made inquiries everywhere, but all to no purpose. On the third day they
heard of a wonderful Child Who sat daily in the Temple disputing with the
doctors. With eager steps Mary and Joseph went to the Temple; as they came
along Mary's ear has caught the sound of a voice which it is impossible
for her to mistake--it is the voice of Jesus. What a sight greets their
eyes as they enter--the great doctors of the Law sitting around, and her
Boy in the midst of them answering questions! "My Son, my Son," Mary
cries, "Why hast Thou done so to us? Behold, Thy father and I have sought
Thee sorrowing." The Son of God lifted His eyes and looked at her, saying,
"Why have ye sought Me? Did ye not know that I must be about My Father's
business?" Nevertheless, He went down to Nazareth and was subject to them.
And His Mother kept all these things in her heart. And Jesus advanced in
age and grace with God and man. When we sin we too lose Jesus, Our Father
and Friend; but do we, like Mary, search for Him until we find Him? We
must not wait for Him to come back to us; we must go and find out where He
is. Sometimes Jesus permits us to suffer pain and anguish. When this is
so, think of Mary, and how sweetly and patiently she suffered during those
three days when she was separated from Jesus. Let us also dwell on the
obedience of Jesus; the Son of God, Our Creator, was subject to His
creature. Oh, my God, give us grace to understand this great mystery and
strength to follow it!

Prayer.

What relief do I feel in my miseries, and what consolation in my
tribulation; what strength do I not find in the midst of temptations, when
I remember and call thee, O my Mother, to my aid? O my most sweet and most
holy Mother Mary, my own Mother, do thou console me! I see myself loaded
with sins and surrounded by enemies, without virtue, and cold in my love
towards God. Comfort me, and let me begin a new life, a life which will be
pleasing to thy Son and to thee. Amen.



Eleventh Day. Meeting Jesus with the Cross.


We have now come to the morning of Good Friday--to Mary's meeting Jesus
with the cross, which is one of her seven dolors. It is twenty-one years
since the three days' loss, and the heart of Mary has traversed a world of
mysteries since then--always in joy, yet always with her lifelong sorrow
before her. It would be impossible to make any calculations of the sum of
love which these years produced in Mary's heart. But now the time has come
when Mary must give Jesus up, to be scourged and to be put to death. The
Passion may be said to begin on the Thursday in Holy Week. The first Mass
took place that night, Our Lord's first unbloody sacrifice, to be followed
on the morrow by the dreadful one of blood. By a miraculous grace Mary is
enabled to go through all the dreadful tortures of that long night of
pain. She hears the sound of the scourging, and sees the cruel soldiers
crown Him with thorns, bandage His eyes, and dare to bend the knee in
mockery before Him Who has one day to be their Judge. She has heard Pilate
say, "Behold the man," and the cry of the people, "Crucify Him, crucify
Him!" and when Pilate said, "I am innocent of the blood of this just man;
look you to it," she heard the dreadful imprecation that was shouted by
the demons around her, "His blood be upon us, and upon our children!
Crucify Him, crucify Him!" Then they lead Him away to pronounce the final
sentence. The streets are filled with a great concourse of people, all
going in one direction towards Calvary. What a journey for Mary, yet she
never shrinks. Oh, how can we, when we look at our sinless Mother
suffering so patiently, how can we murmur at the petty trials that God
sends us? Mary, with St. John and Magdalen, stands at the corner. She does
not even tremble. Hark, that hoarse shouting, that trampling and hurrying
of feet! The procession comes in sight; the centurion leads the way, the
soldiers dragging Jesus and His heavy cross--then the maddened crowd surge
around, about and behind her. She approaches to embrace Him, but the
soldiers thrust her rudely back. He staggers, and falls with a dull, heavy
sound upon the street. O God of heaven! He falls, and His sweet Mother
must stand and look on. Well may she say, "Look and see if there be sorrow
like unto my sorrow." Men crowd around Him, and with curses and blows drag
Him up, and sweep on again on the way to Calvary, to finish their impious
designs. O my Mother, I too was one of the agents in that cruel work!
Surely, when I see all that my most sorrowful Mother had to undergo, it
will cost me no great effort to have a loving devotion to her. Can we look
on this sinless, uncomplaining Mother, standing in the streets of
Jerusalem, gazing on her Son and her God torn and bruised, crowned with
cruel thorns, bending under the heavy cross which we gave Him, and refuse
to bear the little crosses which He gives us? Oh, no! Let us look at our
Mother, and like her see all the beauty of our Jesus in the blood-stained
countenance of the God made man, and carry most gladly all trials that our
loving Lord may send us.

Prayer.

O most holy Mary, in the great battle in which I am now engaged with hell,
do thou always help me! And when thou seest me wavering, and likely to
fall, O my Lady, do thou extend thy hand and sustain me. Mary, my hope, my
refuge, my strength, do thou protect me, and never allow me to lose the
grace of God. And on my part, I resolve always and instantly to have
recourse to thee in all temptations, saying, "Help me, Mary, help me."
Amen.



Twelfth Day. The Crucifixion.


The way of the cross is ended, and they have come to Calvary. They have
stripped Jesus of His garments, and have laid Him on the hard bed of the
cross. Now commences the dreadful work of nailing His blessed hands and
feet to the cross. The right hand is nailed to the cross first, but
through some mistake the left hand will not reach; then a fearful scene
takes place. The brutal soldiers pull with all their force, until,
dislocating the arm, they succeed in stretching the hand to its place.
Picture Mary looking in mute agony on that dreadful scene! His legs are
stretched out, one foot crossed upon the other, and through them the nail
is driven. Now the cross is raised on high, and Jesus hangs upon it. In
the past few moments Mary has suffered a world of woe. The sacrifice of
the Mother was inseparable from that of the Son; it would have cost her
much less to have given her own life, and for this reason she is justly
styled the Queen of martyrs. The first hour of the three long hours of
agony has passed; still Jesus is silent. The second hour begins. There are
fewer persons around the cross; all is silent, and then His lips move.
Mary listens with all her heart: "Father, forgive them; they know not what
they do." Beautiful, beautiful prayer--true of all sins and of all
sinners--"they know not what they do." Beautiful prayer also because it
discloses the heart of a God. For God alone could teach such charity as
this, and Mary, joining her Son in His prayer, looks up to heaven and
repeats, "Father, forgive them; they know not what they do." The third
hour begins, and His first word in this last hour goes through her very
soul: "I thirst." Well might He thirst. Since the night before nothing has
crossed His lips, and Mary, His Mother, is unable to give Him a drink to
cool them, parched and swollen as they are; she cannot even reach to wipe
away the blood that has congealed there. Thus for three long hours she
watches Him in His death-agony, unable to afford Him the slightest
alleviation; until at last He cries out with a loud voice, "Father, into
Thy hands I commend My spirit." And bowing His head, Jesus dies. Such were
the sufferings endured by the Mother of that divine Son. Jesus dies for
love of us, and we live to torture and crucify Him afresh. What sublime
lessons Mary here gives us, and how perfectly is she the model of those
souls whom God permits to be sorely tried in affliction! Their trials are
great, but are they to be compared with hers? Ah, do not complain, but to
enable you to endure your sufferings cast your eyes on this sorrowful
Mother, and ask her to obtain for you grace to imitate her firmness, her
constancy, and her generosity. After Jesus on the cross, the most
beautiful book one can study is Mary at the foot of the cross.

Prayer.

O most tender Mother, it was I that covered thy divine Son with wounds,
and put Him to death! It was I that pierced thy heart with the most bitter
sword of grief! Oh, by those wounds and by that blood, by thy sorrows and
by thy tears, I conjure thee, O Mary, to be my protectress and my
advocate. Pray for me, and for all sinners like me, that so many precious
sufferings may not become useless to us. Amen.



Thirteenth Day. The Taking Down from the Cross.


The sorrowful day is over. All have gradually dispersed, and now only Mary
and the other holy women, with the disciples, remain at the cross. The
bruised and mangled body is lifted down, and laid on the Mother's knee.
When Our Lord dies we are tempted to think that Our Lady's dolors ought to
have ended there; but no, there is still more to be endured. Mary embraces
the lifeless body, washes the gaping wounds, smoothes the tangled hair,
and bathes away the clotted blood that dims its glory. She wraps Him
tenderly in a white linen cloth, and gives Him into the reverential arms
of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. Both of these were disciples of our
blessed Lord. Joseph was a good and just man, and Nicodemus was a man
learned in the Scriptures, who had come to Jesus by night, for fear of the
Jews, and had learned the doctrine of regeneration. Joseph had gone to
Pilate and had begged the body of Jesus, which had been granted to him.
Now he takes Him in his arms, and with the help of Nicodemus places Him in
his own tomb. Well has our blessed Lord said, "The foxes have holes, and
the birds of the air nests: but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His
head." Mary found nothing strange even in the tremendous sorrows that
almost crushed the life out of her. She looks only to God's will. No
matter how uncommon, how exacting, or how apparently unreasonable, she was
always found prepared, always found with these words on her lips, "O God,
Thy will be done." Let us look at our lives, and see if we, like Mary, are
ever ready to do God's will; ever looking at Our Lord crucified, and
willing to bear all the disappointments, trials, and sorrows that He may
send us. Let us look at our immaculate Mother, standing patient and
resigned at the foot of the cross, looking on the sufferings of her dearly
beloved Son, and we will never murmur--no matter how heavy the cross which
our good God in His divine providence may place upon our shoulders.

Prayer.

O Mary most sorrowful! words fail to express the gratitude we owe thee,
for the readiness wherewith thou didst consent to come to the rescue of
our lost world. But do thou deign to receive our thanks, faint and
inadequate though they may be. May the enjoyment of thy present bliss move
thee to intercede with God in behalf of us, thy weeping, weary children.
Be propitious to those who flee to thee for aid, and do thou ever
intercede for those whom thy divine Son redeemed. Amen.



Fourteenth Day. The Burial of Jesus.


It is now the evening of Good Friday, and Mary is sitting at the foot of
the cross with her dead Son upon her lap. It is here that mourners for
future generations will come to find rest and peace. Here the widow, the
orphan, and the lonely will find how good a thing it is to have their
hearts crushed with sorrow, because here they will find the loving arms of
their new Mother Mary around them, and through their grief they will see
God. But now the time has come when Mary must give up her treasure. So
giving the signal to Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, they lift the body
of the dead Creator and move towards the garden tomb. Mary arranges
everything; she adjusts the winding-sheet, and then takes her last look on
the lifeless body of Jesus. "Oh, look and see if there be any sorrow like
unto my sorrow!" Then her adopted son, John, comes to her, drawing her
away, for she is half-dead with the grief and anguish of the past night
and day. Through the same gate by which she had left the city of Jerusalem
in the morning, she re-entered it that night. Poor Jerusalem, that city of
God, how often had Our Lord yearned and wept over it, longing to gather
those chosen ones to Himself! But no, they had rejected Him, and now their
cup of iniquity is filled. They have crucified their King; their pavements
are stained with His blood. Mary knows all this, still there is no room in
her heart for bitterness. Oh, what a contrast to our spirit of revenge,
sometimes for even a fancied wrong. We learn from this dolor of Mary that
there is no darkness like the darkness of a world without Jesus, and if
His absence is caused by our own fault, our own sin, then it is the
greatest of sorrows. O Mary, my Mother, keep us ever by thy side at the
foot of the cross! so that remembering all that thou hast suffered, we
will gladly accept all the sorrows that may come. Amen.

Prayer.

O Virgin Mother most sorrowful, I detest my sins because they have
offended God, and caused thee so much pain! I am sorry for them, and will
be sorry for them as long as I live, and according to the best of my power
will do penance for them. Forgive me, dear Lord, for Thy mercy's sake;
pardon me all that is past, and be Thou my keeper for the time to come,
that I may nevermore offend Thee. Amen.



Fifteenth Day. Help of Christians.


"She hath opened her hand to the needy and stretched out her hand to the
poor."--Prov. xxxi. 20. The whole life of our blessed Mother shows how ever
dear to her has been the alleviation of the miseries that surround us.
Everything in her proves to us how justly the Church gives to her the
title of Help of Christians. Mary's desire to console us in our miseries
is so immense, so vehement, that scarcely have we resolved to address
ourselves to her mercy than she immediately flies to our relief. If Mary
is already inclined and prompt to aid us, even when we do not pray to her,
what may we not expect from her when we lay our miseries before her, to
beseech her to deliver us from them? The Church urges us to apply
unceasingly to her, to observe faithfully the pious practices which are
authorized to be observed in her honor. With this view the Church has
established a great number of feasts in the course of the year, to show
her children that they cannot pay too much honor to the Mother of God.
Happy is he whose love for Mary is ever growing; he is enjoying in time
one of the choicest blessings of eternity. Let us then follow in the
spirit of our holy Church, and have frequent recourse to the bounties of
the divine Mother. If we would only remember how anxious our dear Mother
is to assist and help us, how eagerly we would turn to her in all our
sorrows and joys. O holy Virgin, Help of Christians, come to our aid in
the midst of the miseries by which we are surrounded! We entreat thee,
then, O Mother of goodness, to supply our insufficiency and to bless our
labor. Imprint thy love in all hearts, so that having loved and honored
thy Son upon earth, we may go to praise Him eternally in heaven.

Prayer.

Most loving Mother, no suppliant ever had recourse to thee in vain!
Whatever our needs, thy ear is ever open to our cry. Thou art the Help of
Christians! O good and powerful Mother, come to our aid, and deliver us
from all our troubles. Show thyself our Mother, intercede for each one of
us that we may lead a Christian life, and hereafter reign with Christ
throughout eternity. Amen.



Sixteenth Day. Our Lady of Mercy.


Everything in Mary recalls the august character of mercy. It is her
essence, so to speak; so that whoever names Mary names mercy, as Mary
cannot be without mercy. What could we not say to prove that Mary is all
mercy, and that everything she does tends to clemency? But it may be that
the greatness or the sanctity of this powerful Queen alarms us, and makes
us fear to present ourselves before her, we who are so guilty in the sight
of God. Let us take courage, for the more holy and elevated Mary is, the
more gentle and affable she shows herself to the sinner. Mary welcomes all
mankind without exception; no one leaves her presence with a disconsolate
or sorrowful heart. Let our confidence in Mary have no bounds, since we
know that her power equals the extent of her mercy. That good Mother
herself gave St. Bridget to understand as much when she told her, "I am
the Queen of heaven, and the Mother of mercy. There is none on earth to
whom I refuse my pity; not one who has not obtained some grace through my
intercession." Who can doubt that it is true to say that many who are now
saved would have been lost except for Mary? If it is true to say that he
is happy who loves Mary, so it is also true to say that there will be woe
for all eternity to him who in this life is able to secure her mercy, but
does not do so, and thus loses himself by his own fault. Flee then to
Mary, O my soul; beseech her to take pity on thee, and secure thy
salvation, which cost her Son so dear, and which is so priceless to her
maternal heart. Be assured that all will be well with thee if thou art not
lacking in true devotion and love to Mary.

Prayer.

O blessed Mother, thou art the Mother of God, the Mother of sinners, the
Mother of the banished ones! Grant, O gracious Virgin, that I, thy sinful
child, may not be condemned by thy divine Son; but do thou intercede for
me, that He, the divine Judge, may at last welcome me, a poor exile, into
His eternal home. Amen.



Seventeenth Day. Our Lady of Perpetual Help.


It is impossible to study the history of Jesus and Mary without perceiving
a uniform law of Providence uniting them in the great events of their
lives. Unless Mary had consented to become His Mother, Jesus would not
have been born. Divine grace, no doubt, disposed her to give assent, but
the act was not the less one of her own free will. As certain as man has
been redeemed by the incarnation and Passion of Jesus, so surely did God
make the whole depend in the first instance on the co-operation of Mary.
If, therefore, you believe that Jesus Christ came to us through Mary,
believe also that the graces which He merited for us must come to us
through His Mother. If you believe that without her you were not redeemed,
believe also that without her you will not be saved. God wished that Mary
should be looked upon and honored as the perpetual help of sinners, to
obtain their conversion. O Mother of perpetual help! thou art the
dispenser of all those gifts which God granted to us wretched sinners. He
has made thee so powerful, so rich, and so beautiful, in order that thou
mayest succor us in our misery. In thy hands I place my eternal salvation,
and to thee I consign my soul. I wish to be remembered among thy devoted
servants.

Prayer.

O Mother of perpetual help, take me under thy protection and I shall be
secure! I shall not fear Jesus Christ, my eternal Judge, for by one prayer
of thine He will be appeased. What I fear is that in the hour of
temptation, I may neglect to have recourse to thee, and thus be lost.
Obtain for me, therefore, the pardon of my sins, final perseverance, and
the priceless gift to love Jesus Christ and to have recourse to thee, O
Mother of perpetual help. Amen.



Eighteenth Day. Confidence in Mary.


Let our veneration for Mary be full of confidence. Our first parents had
drawn upon us the greatest of miseries, but through the divine mercy a new
Adam and Eve have more than repaired our misfortunes. God could have
performed the work of redemption by other means; but He preferred the very
way by which man had lost his innocence. That is to say, that as Satan
first deceived the woman, and through her means deceived all men, so by a
woman Satan in his turn should be confounded, and men be saved. Of course
Our Lord is the true mediator between God and man, yet it is also true
that after having sinned, we dare not appear before God. His presence
fills us with fear, so we have need of a mediatrix--and this we have in
Mary. If you desire an intercessor with God, have recourse to Mary, all
pure, all powerful, and full of mercy. Oh, then, all you who are exposed
to the temptations of the world, raise your eyes to this Star of the sea.
Call on Mary, and you will soon experience the powerful effects of her
intercession. Conducted by her, you will securely reach the port of a
blessed eternity.

Prayer.

Sweet and kind Virgin, full of dignity and bounty, Virgin sanctified in
the womb, Virgin powerful as thou art pure, most glorious Mother of God,
Mother most chaste, and Lady most reverently honored, I pray thee of thy
goodness to preserve my body and my soul from all sin, and take them both
into thy holy keeping. Amen.



Nineteenth Day. The Love of Mary.


O Mary most amiable, who can name thee and not be inflamed with love? What
Mother so worthy of love, so kind and generous to us as Mary? To her
heaven is indebted for the countless number of the elect redeemed by the
blood of her dear Son. As Mother of Our Redeemer, Mary regards us as her
own possession. She knows how costly was the ransom paid for us, therefore
she never ceases to intercede that none may be lost. How then could we
help loving this Daughter of the King, who interests herself so much in
our behalf? If we love God we must love His holy Mother. It is our daily
task to love Jesus more and more, and experience tells us that we never
advance more rapidly in love of God than when we are accompanied by His
Mother. There is no time lost in seeking Jesus if we go at once to Mary.
She is the short road to Him, and speedy and full are the answers to the
petitions which her hand presents. O Mary most admirable, obtain that we
may love thee with all the powers of our soul, with all the tenderness of
our heart, and with all our strength.

Prayer.

O Mother most amiable and admirable! O wondrous Mother, thou art all
lovely and glorious! Thou art the most blessed and most perfect of all!
Kind and gracious Mother, pray for us, win us grace to love thee with a
most tender love, that we may thereby grow in love for Jesus, thy Son.
Amen.



Twentieth Day. Imitation of Mary.


All true love consists in the imitation of what we honor. If we love the
immaculate Mary, if we desire to please her, endeavor to imitate her
virtues, we must first imitate her in her life of prayer. To lead a life
of prayer it is not necessary to spend hours on our knees in the church,
for every-day duties would not admit of that. We find that Our Lady always
left her prayer to spend an allotted time at work. We should let the
thought of God be the first object of our waking love, and the love of God
be the absorbing feeling of our heart. During the day we should every now
and then cast a loving glance towards heaven, and make acts of love and
gratitude. "If you imitate and follow Mary," says St. Bernard, "you cannot
wander from the road. Our Blessed Lady will fill you with great confidence
in God and in herself, because you will not be approaching to Jesus by
yourself, but always by that good Mother." O Mary, Mother of the divine
Saviour, Who from the height of His cross, seeing each one of us in the
person of the beloved disciple, pronounced the memorable words, "Behold
thy son!" "Behold thy Mother," obtain that we may love and imitate thee
with all the tenderness and strength of our will.

Prayer.

Glory and honor be to thee, O Mary! Thy throne is in the highest heavens!
Be thou our loving Mother; from the throne of thy glory cast a glance on
us, who are encircled with so many dangers and trials. Pray to thy Son
Jesus for us, that we may emulate the purity of the angels, so that we too
may one day enjoy the "beatific vision," and praise Our Creator throughout
eternity. Amen.



Twenty-first Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Faith.


The Blessed Virgin has left us examples of faith which are full of
instruction and consolation. She believed the mystery of the Trinity, that
she should conceive and bring forth a child; the words of the angel
announced this mystery to her. She believed that the Son of God the Father
was to take the form of man, thereby making Himself like unto us. She
believed herself to be the Virgin chosen by God in whom this mystery was
to be accomplished. The apostles had faith in Jesus Christ and
acknowledged Him to be the Son of God, but in the hour of Our Lord's
Passion they abandoned their divine Master. It was not so with our blessed
Mother; she followed Him even to Calvary. O Mary, may we understand well
the excellence of this fundamental virtue, without which it is impossible
to please God. It is by faith that Jesus Christ comes into our hearts. By
faith we resist the devil, and put him to flight. Let us then love and
value more and more the precious gift of faith, and endeavor, after the
example of Mary, our Mother, to be animated by its spirit. But the faith
of the Blessed Virgin teaches us another lesson: namely, that after her
example we should make an open profession of our faith, even though by it
we should lose goods, fortune, honor, even life itself.

Prayer.

O Mary, thou art the Queen of heaven and Mistress of all created things!
Obtain for us the lively faith that animated thee, so that we may grow in
love, persevere to the end, and hereafter, in company with patriarchs,
prophets, and all the elect of God, glorify thee, together with the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost through all eternity. Amen.



Twenty-second Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Piety.


According to universal opinion, the Blessed Virgin dwelt in the Temple
till she was about twelve years of age. During those tender years of her
life she passed the greater portion of the night in the contemplation of
heavenly things, giving but a very short time to repose. Chosen by the
Lord, adorned and enriched with His most signal favors, the immaculate
Virgin corresponded thereto with constant and generous fidelity. The
devotion of Mary is worthy of imitation, especially in this, that she gave
herself up to it from her early youth. Alas! how many souls have perished
because they have not followed this example? On the other side how happy
those who have imitated the early devotion of the Blessed Virgin! Oh, how
strong and mighty we are with Jesus Christ, when we are armed with the
worthy merits and intercession of the Mother of God! O Mary, vessel of
singular devotion, obtain for us that, after thy example, we may be
entirely devoted to God!

Prayer.

Most loving Mother, no suppliant ever had recourse to thee in vain!
Whatever our needs, thy ear is ever open to our cry. Thou art the
comforter of the afflicted, O good and powerful Mother. Come to our aid
and deliver us from all our troubles; intercede for each one of us that we
may lead a Christian life, and hereafter reign with Christ throughout
eternity. Amen.



Twenty-third Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Hope.


The salvation of the just (as well of the body as of the soul) is from the
Lord. He is their help in time of tribulation, He will uphold them lest
they fall, He will bring them out of danger, deliver them from the hands
of sinners, and will save them in the end. And why will God bestow such
honors on the just? Because, replies the Psalmist, they have hoped in Him,
and put all their confidence in Him. At the marriage of Cana, Mary saw the
sudden failing of the wine, and her tender charity caused her to have
recourse to the omnipotent power of her Son. Our Lord up to that period
had not worked any miracles, but knowing His tender Heart Mary hesitated
not to have recourse to Him, and her hope was not unfounded. Let us then,
like Mary, expose our wants to Jesus, and we shall obtain strength and
courage to aid us in the accomplishment of our duties. Let us labor by
every possible means to obtain this great gift of confidence by frequent
prayer, almsdeeds, and penitential works, as well as by great purity of
life. "Whatever you shall ask the Father in My name, I will grant it to
you."

Prayer.

Mother most amiable! By thy beauty and unsullied purity thou wast ever
attractive in the divine sight. Entreat Jesus that He would grant us grace
to love Him more and more fervently, and that by our purity and innocence
of life we may spread abroad the sweet odor of Jesus Christ, and daily
become more acceptable in His sight. Amen.



Twenty-fourth Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Humility.


The Blessed Virgin possessed the spirit of humility in a perfect degree.
Not that she failed to know the gifts which God had bestowed upon her; on
the contrary she ever remembered that God had drawn her out of nothing,
and she returned Him incessant thanks for the favors which He had given
her. This virtue is most essential, since without it there is no grace for
us, no recompense in heaven; while with it there is pardon, every
blessing, and eternal salvation. Let us often meditate on these words of
our blessed Mother when she went to visit St. Elizabeth: "The Lord hath
regarded the humility of His handmaid." The archangel Gabriel had saluted
her full of grace and blessed among women, but the holy Virgin only
humbles herself more and more, confessing aloud that she is but the
handmaid of the Lord. What a contrast to our pride and self-sufficiency!
If, on account of some appearance of good, we are charged with some duty
of importance, do we not immediately begin to consider ourselves
something? while in reality we are but nothingness, misery, and sin. St.
Basil says there are three things which will establish humility in the
heart. First, a perfect conviction of our own nothingness. Second, the
constant consideration of the conduct of the good, who are better than
ourselves. Third, persevering obedience to those to whom we owe
submission.

Prayer.

O tender Mother! despise not our petitions, receive our homage,
veneration, and love. Be thou our Queen; in thee do we place our whole
trust, for thou art our gracious Mother. To thee do we commit ourselves,
body, soul, and spirit, with all we have and are. Show thyself our Mother
both in life and death, O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Amen.



Twenty-fifth Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Charity.


It is truly Mary, who, after her divine Son, has given us the most
touching example of charity. Everywhere she appears full of grace, of
meekness, consideration, goodness, mildness, and tenderness. Her charity
was as boundless as her love of God. But now that she enjoys the clear
vision of her Beloved, how great must be the increase of her love towards
Him, and consequently of her charity towards mankind. All her person, her
looks, her actions, her movements, her whole life breathe nothing but
charity. In going to visit her cousin Elizabeth, the charity of Mary was
manifested. This charity caused her to leave her home to undertake a long
and painful journey under circumstances that unfitted her for fatigue. The
same virtue shone forth at the marriage of Cana, when she saved the bride
and bridegroom the mortification of telling their guests that the wine had
given out. Her heart was one with her divine Son, Who loved His enemies so
much that He gave Himself up for their salvation. Alas, how we shrink from
forgiving the slightest offence that is offered to us! O my Mother, why am
I not inflamed by at least a spark of the love of God! Then I would not
find it so hard to forgive all who have offended me.

Prayer.

With deep humility do we exclaim, Pray for us, O holy Mother of God! Thou
art the Mother of Him Who is Our Redeemer and Our God, but thou art also
the Mother of sinners, for whom thy divine Son shed His blood. Intercede
for us with Jesus, and beg for grace that we may love Him with all our
heart and all our strength. Amen.



Twenty-sixth Day. The Virgin Mary the Model of Advancement in Virtue.


Our spiritual advancement consists, as we have often heard, in being well
persuaded that we are far from the height to which we aspire, and on that
account we should make constant efforts to become better--because not to
advance is to go back. Persons who are aiming ever so little at perfection
are the choice portion of God's creation, and are dear to Him as the apple
of His eye. Oh, that we could imitate Mary, who, full of grace from the
first moment of her conception, corresponded thereto with such fidelity
that the angels exclaimed, "Who is she that cometh forth as the morning,
rising fair as the moon, bright as the sun?" The most exact observance,
not only of precepts but of the lightest counsels, was the fruit of the
love that burned in the heart of Mary, so that she was never guilty of the
least imperfection. Ah, would that I too could speed more rapidly onwards
in the heavenly road! How many graces would God then lavish upon me! O
Mary, my tender Mother, aid me to imitate thee in thy advancement in
virtue. O Mother most sweet, draw us more and more by the sweet odor of
thy virtues to be a perfect disciple, imitator, and slave of the Incarnate
Wisdom, Jesus Christ, thy Son.

Prayer.

O Mary, by thy example thou didst animate confessors and virgins,
sustaining them in the dangerous struggle with the world, the flesh and
the devil. Aid us, too, O mighty Queen, so that we may live as becomes the
faithful disciples of thyself and thy divine Son. Amen.



Twenty-seventh Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Patience.


Of the virtue of perfect patience, the Blessed Virgin has left us many
bright examples. We have meditated on her dolors and we have seen with
what wonderful patience she endured them. How patient and firm she stood
at the foot of the cross, on which her Son was fastened, covered with
wounds and loaded with ignominy! Mary maintained an entire resignation to
the divine will, which she loved more than her own, but this perfect
conformity did not render her less sensible to her martyrdom. She loved to
suffer because it was God's will that she should do so. We are encouraged,
by the example left us of the invincible patience of Mary, to imitate it
to the best of our power and according to our degree of grace. We shall
follow, though distantly, in the footsteps of this perfect model, if we
bear with patience the trials that overtake us, whether they be loss of
fortune, health, or reputation. If we feel that we are getting angry let
us overcome ourselves by silence; for then it is that we have the most
need to be silent, because even the most prudent man when roused to anger
can with difficulty restrain himself from angry words, which later he will
regret heartily. O my Mother, obtain for us from Jesus the gift of
patience, by means of which we shall acquire all other virtues and be
enabled to persevere in holiness to the end of our lives. Amen.

Prayer.

O blessed Mother! Look graciously on thy children; behold how we, by our
sins, have forfeited all claim to grace. Compassionate our misery, aid us
from the abundance of thy fulness, and entreat thy Son Jesus that He would
grant us grace to be pleasing in His sight and thine, and to remain
faithful unto death. Amen.



Twenty-eighth Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Poverty.


True and perfect poverty, says Albert the Great, consists in voluntary
renouncing all temporal things for God's sake, in having but what is
absolutely necessary, and in sometimes retrenching even in that for God;
for where there is full provision against necessity, there is no poverty.
Throughout her entire life Mary's perfect love of poverty is manifest. It
was evident in the obscure city of Nazareth where this young virgin
espoused to a poor carpenter dwelt, and afterwards when she set forth with
Joseph for Bethlehem in obedience to the edict of Augustus. On her arrival
where does she find shelter? There is no place at the inns for one so
poor, so they are obliged to take refuge in a deserted stable, and there,
exposed to all the inclemencies of the weather, the Queen of angels brings
forth the Son of the Most High. Let every one, according to his state in
life, imitate the poverty of the Blessed Virgin. Those who possess
temporal goods should imitate her by despising them, and by not loving
them too much, by estimating them at their true value, since they pass
away so quickly. Those who are poor from necessity should imitate the
example of the Blessed Virgin, and freely embrace and be contented with
the state in which God has placed them.

Prayer.

My most sweet, most compassionate, most amiable Queen! Oh, how great is
the confidence with which St. Bernard inspires me when I have recourse to
thee! I am a poor sinner, deserving of a thousand hells; I wish to change
my life; I wish to love my God, Whom I have so greatly offended. My Lady,
dost thou understand me? Yes, I trust that thou hast understood me, and
graciously heard my prayer. Amen.



Twenty-ninth Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Obedience.


Our Lord became obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross, in
order that we might, after His example, labor to acquire and practise the
virtue of obedience. The perfection to which Mary carried the obedience
due to her Creator has been implied in treating of the love of God with
which her heart was inflamed; it was the source of her perfect conformity
to the divine will. What an example of obedience does she not give us in
the presentation of Jesus in the Temple! Mary was exempted from the
obligation common to all women to go to the Temple to be purified.
Nevertheless, as her divine Son was pleased to submit to circumcision, so
she would submit to the law of purification. The person who obeys merits
very much while doing little, because obedience springs from the spirit of
perfect self-abnegation, which is the most agreeable holocaust to God.
Thomas a Kempis says, "Whoever willingly obeys his superiors for God's
sake, performs an heroic action as a valiant soldier of Jesus Christ, for
he will receive with the martyrs the palm of a glorious immortality."

Prayer.

My most sweet Lady and Mother, I am a vile rebel to thy great Son; but I
come repentant to thy mercy that thou mayest obtain pardon for me. From
thee I hope for every good, forgiveness, perseverance, and heaven. I hope
to be one of those, who, in the kingdom of the blessed will most praise
thy mercies, O Mary, for having saved us by thy intercession. Amen.



Thirtieth Day. The Blessed Virgin the Model of Modesty.


The Blessed Virgin was a perfect pattern of modesty; her exterior senses
were in all things under the control of reason, and subjected to the will
of God; gravity and composure marked her every movement. Oh, you who have
the happiness of having chosen her for your Mother, if you love her as
true children, endeavor with all possible ardor to imitate her modesty. We
should particularly try to acquire that moderation of the tongue for which
the Blessed Virgin was so conspicuous, and for this reason we should avoid
all useless conversations. The Holy Ghost Himself has told us that in much
speaking we cannot escape from sin. Thus walking in the footsteps of our
blessed Mother in the faithful practice of this virtue, it will not only
preserve us from many falls, many temptations and dangers, but it will
also be a most powerful means of advantage in the way of sanctity and of
edifying and drawing souls to God. Then will all our exterior conduct,
regulated by interior motives, tend to the glory of God, the edification
of our neighbor, and our own advantage.

Prayer.

Most holy, immaculate Virgin, and my Mother Mary, to thee, who art the
Mother of my Lord, the Queen of the world, the advocate, the hope, and the
refuge of sinners, I have recourse--I who am the most miserable of all. I
thank thee for all the graces which thou hast hitherto granted me, and
especially I thank thee for having delivered me from hell, which I have so
often deserved. I promise always to serve thee, and to do all that I can
that thou mayest also be loved by others. Amen.



Thirty-first Day. The Assumption.


Tradition says that after Mary's sacred remains had been most reverently
entombed by the apostles, songs were heard proceeding from her sepulchre
during the space of three days, and on the third day St. Thomas came,
imploring to have the slab removed from the tomb that he might gaze for
the last time on the beloved features of Mary. The slab was raised, but as
he bent forward to look upon her, he started back in amazement; naught was
to be seen save the grave-clothes in which the sacred body had been
enveloped. The body itself was nowhere to be found. Then they knew that
God had taken her, body and soul, to heaven. St. John describes the
coronation in these terms: A great sign appeared in the heavens; a woman
clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown
of twelve stars; and the Queen thus crowned took her place near her Son on
a throne prepared from all eternity. O you who fear the justice of God! O
you who dare not cast yourself at the feet of Jesus! remember you have
with Him a powerful advocate, who is Mary. O Mary, thou blessed, loving
Mother, compassionate thy orphan children; pray for us, and place us one
day near thee in the heavenly Jerusalem.

Prayer.

O holy virgin Mary, who, in order to inspire us with boundless confidence,
hast been pleased to assume the sweet name of Mother of perpetual succor,
we implore thee to come to our aid always and everywhere; in our
temptations, after our falls, in our difficulties, in all the miseries of
life, and above all in the sad hour of our death. Amen.




Mass in Union with Mary Immaculate.


Prayer Before Mass.

O Mary immaculate! I come to place myself body and soul under thy special
care and protection. Take me by the hand, that thy purity may hide the
deformity of my soul, thy praises and thy love may supply my deficiencies.
I also place in thy hands all my hopes, all my sorrows, all my cares--my
life and the end thereof. As thou didst stand by the cross of thy Son,
joining thy prayers to His for man's redemption, so wilt thou come to help
me now. Kindle my devotion, aid me with thy mighty intercession, so that I
may worthily love and praise my God, and participate in the merits of
Jesus, thy divine Son. Amen.

Confiteor.

"O Father," will I cry with the prodigal, "I have sinned against heaven
and before Thee. I am not worthy to be called Thy child." I have
grievously offended Thee through my whole life, and therefore am unworthy
to lift my eyes to heaven. O Mary, my Mother! beg of God grace for me, and
He will hear thee. Obtain that I may know all my faults and devoutly make
a sincere avowal of them, followed by a true repentance, so that I may
obtain pardon for them through the loving mercy of my God. Amen.

Introit.

Behold me, O my God, at Thy feet; dispose of me as Thou pleasest. I devote
myself entirely to Thee, and since my sins alone can render me displeasing
to Thee, therefore I cry aloud to Thee for mercy and pardon. Amen.

Kyrie.

Lord be merciful to me a sinner! O Father of infinite mercy, have pity on
Thy child! O Mary, powerful advocate, help of sinners, aid us by thy
supplicating voice, and the just One by excellence will descend as a long-
expected rain! O Fountain of love, grant this mercy to me and to all poor
sinners! Amen.

Gloria.

Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace to men of good-will! I praise
Thee, I bless Thee, I adore Thee! Blessed angels, messengers of Our Lord,
who came before our King to prepare a place in which He should descend, I
beseech thee in the name of thy love for Our God, teach me to love Him.
Amen.

Collect.

Glorious Virgin Mary, thou who art the true mediatrix between thy sweet
Son and poor repentant sinners, pray for me, obtain for me the favorable
attention of Our God and Saviour. And do Thou, O Jesus, enrich my soul
with Thy gifts, to the full extent of Thy tender compassion. Amen.

Epistle.

O most pure Mary, who knowest so well how to penetrate and comprehend
Jesus, open my soul, dilate it, so that it may be replenished with that
abundance of gifts which it will receive from heaven through thy
intercession. Amen.

Gospel.

Ah, to whom shall we go, O Jesus, if not to Thee, since Thou hast the
words of eternal life? Thou, O Jesus, my Lord and my God, art the true
light, for Whose dawn the saints of the Old Law watched with longing eyes,
looking to Thee for grace and salvation. O Mary immaculate, Virgin always
faithful! lead us to Jesus, help us to find Jesus, and attach us to Him
forever by the bonds of perfect charity, which, uniting us to His
sacrifice during time, will associate us to His glory in eternity. Amen.

Credo.

O my God, I firmly believe in one God in three divine Persons, the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost! I believe in Jesus Christ, the true and only
Son of God, Who was born of the Virgin Mary, and died on the cross for our
salvation. I also believe all the sacred truths the Catholic Church
believes and teaches, because Thou hast revealed them, Who canst neither
deceive nor be deceived. O sweet Jesus, give me knowledge and
understanding that I may live and die in this faith! Amen.

Offertory.

Accept, O eternal Father, this offering which is here made to Thee by Thy
minister, in the name of all here present and of Thy whole Church. It is
yet only bread and wine, but by a miracle of Thy power and grace it will
shortly become the body and blood of Thy divine Son. Now the august
sacrifice begins, everything recalls the sorrows of our dear Jesus; His
bitter agony, accompanied by a most heroic act of perfect submission when
He consents to expiate every crime. O Jesus, Jesus! It is I who have bound
Thee! it is I who have had the misfortune to lead Thee out to death! From
this instant, O Jesus, I give myself to Thee! O Mary, my powerful
protectress, purify us in the ardors of thy pure love, and do thou thyself
place us on the paten with the bread, and in the chalice with the wine.
Amen.

Lavabo.

Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right spirit within me! Oh,
wash me, dear Lord, from all the stains of sin, in the blood of the Lamb,
that I may be worthy to be present at these heavenly mysteries. O Mary
immaculate, may thy sorrows heal the wounds of my soul. Amen.

Preface.

Let us lift ourselves up to heaven, O my soul, and render thanks to the
Lord Our God. O Mary most pure, aid us to break all the ties that still
bind us to earth. Oh, may I, great God, unite my heart and voice with all
the heavenly court, and cry with them: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
hosts! Blessed is He Who cometh in the name of the Lord! Heaven and earth
are full of Thy glory! Hosanna in the highest; blessed is He that cometh
in the name of the Lord; hosanna in the highest!

Canon.

We conjure Thee, O Lord, to listen favorably to our humble prayers, to
receive the vows and supplications we offer. We desire to adore, praise,
and glorify Thee, and to give Thee thanks for Thy great glory, joining our
hearts and voices with all the blessed in heaven, and with Thy whole
Church upon earth. O Mary, Mother of mercy! Ask Jesus to give us the
ineffable grace of appreciating, imitating, and loving Him until
death--that Jesus sacrificed by love, and immolated perpetually for us upon
our altars. Amen.

Consecration.

The priest has said: "This is My body; this is My blood;" and Jesus has
descended into his hands. The God of heaven and earth obeys a weak
creature. O mystery of love! O prodigy of annihilation! O my soul,
gratitude and love ought to be thy language. Eternal Truth, in Thee I
believe, strengthen Thou my faith, that I may love Thee ever more and
more, and hereafter behold Thee face to face in Thy celestial kingdom--my
Jesus and my all! Amen.

Elevation Of The Host.

Hail, Victim of salvation, eternal King, Incarnate Word! Sacrificed for me
and for all mankind, O Jesus host, Jesus love, Jesus Saviour! Holy Father,
turn Thy eyes upon me, or rather look upon Thy beloved Son. Give me all
that I ask in His name, and in the name of my immaculate Mother. Amen.

Elevation Of The Chalice.

Holy, holy blood, flowing from my Saviour's Heart, do thou cleanse me from
all sin. It is Thyself, again Thyself, sweet and blessed Jesus Christ, Who
art also entire within this chalice. Again and again, I adore Thee, and
beseech Thee to be my salvation. Amen.

Memento Of The Living And The Dead.

And now, O my God, I wish to pray for all Thy holy Catholic Church, and
for all Christians, religious and secular; to all give perseverance, O my
God! Remember, O Jesus, those souls purchased by Thy precious blood, who
have died in Thy peace, but nevertheless are deprived of Thy presence.
Stretch forth unto them Thy strong right hand, and bring them into a place
of refreshment, light, and peace. Amen.

Nobis Quoque.

I most humbly implore Thy mercy, O Lord, for myself also. I beg pardon for
all my sins; I desire to detest them, and to renounce them forever. Then,
O my God, Thou wilt accept my gifts, and we will render to Jesus all
honor, praise, and glory. Amen.

Pater Noster.

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy
will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass
against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

Agnus Dei.

O Lamb of God, sacrificed for my sake, have mercy on me! O adorable Victim
of my salvation, look down on me and save me! Divine Mediator, obtain
pardon of Thy Father for me a sinner, and mercifully grant me the sweets
of Thy peace! O Mary, conceived without sin, obtain for me purity of
heart, soul, and body. Amen.

Communion.

In the presence of the true body and the true blood of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, O my God, I place myself most humbly and devoutly at the feet of
Thy loving mercy. Make me avoid sin in the present, pardon that which I
have committed in the past, and guard me against it in the future. O Mary,
conceived without sin, place me in the sanctuary of thy maternal heart, so
that, like thee, I may preserve in peace, silence, and love, Him Whose
possession makes all my happiness, all my delight, all my hope. Amen.

Benediction.

O Jesus, Saviour of my soul, pour down on me by the hand of Thy minister
Thy most abundant blessing. Illuminate my heart with Thy clear light, and
grant that nothing may ever separate me from Thee. Amen.

Last Gospel.

O Word made flesh Who didst annihilate Thyself to give Thyself to me! Thou
Who art the life and light of the world, enlighten me. How ought I not to
be affected with the exceeding privilege I have enjoyed. O my God! I unite
myself to Thee by the ties of love and gratitude; thus alone can I
correspond with Thy mercies. Amen.

Prayer After Mass.

And now once more I commend myself to Thee, O my God! I commend myself
throughout the hours of this day to Thy keeping, to the keeping of Thy
holy Mother and of Thy holy angels, and bring before Thee, for the same
loving care, my kindred, my brothers and sisters, my friends, my
benefactors, and all Christian people. Amen.

JUNE. THE SACRED HEART.


He who meditates on the life of Christ, and is acquainted with it,
instinctively strikes upon this trait in the character of Jesus: The
sweetness of His human Heart. The entire life of our blessed Lord was one
series of most loving acts. We see Him at one time blessing the little
children, at another bestowing sight on the blind, loosening the tongue of
the dumb, pouring consolation into the aching heart of the mother who has
lost her child, and pardoning the repentant sinner. Is it not a beautiful
devotion by which we are drawn to view the loving tenderness of His human
Heart, by which He won all to His side, so that not only His apostles
clung to Him, but even the very pagans loved and revered Him?

Let us then love and practise this beautiful devotion, by offering that
Heart the gold of charity and the incense of prayer. Let us go with filial
confidence to Him, Who has taught us to lisp like an infant, "Abba,
Father." Let us repay Him love for love, and make reparation for the
injuries He daily receives in that most kind Heart. Jesus in His turn will
comfort us in all our pains and afflictions. The Sacred Heart of Jesus is
the source of all charity and love; and through this devotion we will
learn to love our neighbor and to sacrifice ourselves for his benefit.


    Sweet Heart of Jesus, be my love.
    Sweet heart of Mary, be my salvation.




Considerations and prayers for Every Day.



First Day. The Love of the Sacred Heart for Us.


The love of the Sacred Heart for us is at once the tender affection of a
brother, and the infinite love of the Son of God, with which, from all
eternity, Our Redeemer looked forward eagerly to the salvation of mankind.
He saw us doomed to everlasting death, He saw us, and each one of us
individually among the number, unable to atone for our sins. Then He
offered Himself to satisfy the justice of the Father. Thou didst implore
mercy for us, and it was granted Thee, only on condition that Thou
shouldst satisfy for us. And what satisfaction was required! Torments the
most cruel, insults the most humiliating, death on the cross--that was the
price at which Thou wast permitted to redeem us. Thou didst accept all,
and wast even ready to suffer more if necessary. Ah, Lord! What then shall
I do for Thee? What return can I make for such great love? O generous, O
incomprehensible Friend! How can I ever repay the debt I owe Thee, Heart
of my Jesus? I abandon my whole being to Thy sweet love, to live and die
therein.

Prayer.

Adorable Heart of my Saviour, I adore Thee, praise Thee, and offer Thee my
whole self. O divine Jesus, I beseech Thee to receive me to-day into Thy
Sacred Heart! Pour into my heart the light, help and graces I need to
conquer my enemies, and to surmount all obstacles that will hinder my
salvation, and the Christian perfection required to please Thee. Amen.



Second Day. The Heart of Jesus My Friend.


Oh, what folly, what delusion can be worse than to set one's heart on
anything save Thee alone, O God! How poor is he who seeks not his whole
good in Thy sweet friendship alone! Heart of my Jesus, wounded for love of
me, permit me to draw nigh to Thy open side, and confess to Thee a
thousand times over that I love Thee. O Heart of Jesus, forgive my past
foolishness! O beloved and adorable Redeemer, who will give water to my
head, and a fountain of tears to my eyes, that I may weep day and night
for the contempt shown to Thy love, and the ingratitude with which Thy
benefits are repaid! O ye angels, who crowd the sanctuaries in which
dwells the divine Spouse of our souls, cease not to pour forth at the foot
of His altars the most profound homage. One of the usual duties shown by
people towards those whom they respect are visits. Jesus Christ is our
Friend, our Father. He is in our midst: we know it, and yet He is the only
One Whom we forget. Whoever thinks of visiting Jesus Christ? We frequent
the church and fulfil our other religious duties, but do we always go
through motives of love or gratitude, and with the expected intention of
rendering homage to Our Lord? O Jesus, could a more cruel wound be
inflicted on this loving Heart? O Sacred Heart of my Jesus, forgive me,
and vouchsafe me the blessing of remaining forever Thy child.

Prayer.

Prostrate before Thee, O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I humbly pay Thee all my
homage, and my profound adoration. I adore Thee, O Sacred Heart, destined
from all eternity to be God's masterpiece and the prodigy of His power,
wisdom and goodness. Amen.



Third Day. The Heart of My Jesus the Heart of My Father.


Heart of Jesus, Thou art my Father! All I have is from Thee; at every step
I meet with proofs of Thy infinite love. Even when I strayed away from
Thee, Thou didst entreat me to return, assuring me of pardon and love. If
I shed tears of sorrow, Thy love wiped them away, and Thy sweet voice gave
courage to my sinking soul. O my sweet Jesus, be forever a Father to me!
What an amount of gratitude do I not owe to my Lord, when after so much
love and care, He reappears among us in the Sacrament of the Altar? In
thus dwelling among us, He willed to unite Himself with us, in a way as
intimate as it is incomprehensible; shutting Himself up under the
appearance of bread, He enters into our hearts and makes His own flesh our
nourishment. What a source of happiness for me, O my sweet Jesus! My eyes
do not see Thy divine face, but my heart feels Thy comforting presence.
When I receive Thee, O Father, into my breast, I feel my soul gladdened
with the wine of heaven, "which maketh virgins." And since love causes
lovers to resemble each other, if we love let us form our life on the
model of Jesus. Let us therefore, belong forever to the Beloved of our
souls. Let us give Him our whole heart, our love, our affections,
inclinations, and desires.

Prayer.

Allow me, O my Saviour, to offer Thee my heart, and grant that I seek only
to please Thee in all things. From this moment I consecrate my heart to
Thee; take possession of it, destroy its indifference, purify its
affections, and give a new life to its inclinations. O sweet Jesus, take
possession of me and consume me in the flames of Thy love. Amen.



Fourth Day. In Thy Heart I Shall Find Peace.


Thee, Thee alone, O Heart of my God, will I love! Heart most pure, Heart
most holy, never tiring of my insults, ever forgiving and forgetting, and,
if I do but love Thee sincerely, admitting me as a chosen friend to Thy
sweet company. "Come unto Me, all you that labor, and are heavily
burdened, and I will give you rest." Seek not elsewhere for relief in
sorrow: come to the Heart of One Who loves you. Never will you meet with a
more generous giver, never will you meet a kinder friend, never will you
meet one who will bear with you more patiently in your trials and
temptations. Be comforted, then, my heart, in having this God of love, Who
will not abandon you; Who has no sweeter choice than to hearken to your
prayers. Well, dear Lord, behold how my poor soul is chained down, what
billows of sorrow buffet it and all but wreck it. Come then, O Heart of my
Jesus, come to me or I perish. In Thee alone do I find relief. Be Thou a
thousand times blessed, O sweetest Heart, for all Thy mercy! O admirable
Heart, forgive my guilty wretchedness. Henceforth Thee alone will I seek,
Thee alone will I love. I shall serve Thee and Thee only till my dying
gasp, in hope of praising and loving Thee forever more in heaven.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, be Thou praised and blessed forever as the source
of supernatural life, the nourishment of the soul, and the sustenance of
the spirit! From Thy fulness all good is poured out upon us. Fill my
heart, I beseech Thee, with the sentiments that inspired Thy adorable
Heart. Amen.



Fifth Day. The Sacred Heart of Jesus Teaching Charity.


Thy Heart, O my Jesus, is a mystery of charity; mine is a mystery of
malice. I am ashamed and confounded when I consider attentively Thy Heart,
O my Jesus! Thou, the Creator and Master of all things--Thou art meek and
lowly of heart, and I, a poor outcast, am full of pride and presumption.
How often have I not outraged Thy love and despised Thy law, and still
Thou art silent and forgivest me! Thou art ever ready to welcome back Thy
lost sheep, no matter how far they have strayed, nor how deeply they have
wounded and insulted Thy loving Heart! And can it be that after that I
would dare violate the charity I owe my neighbor? That I would, for a
slight offence, allow proud and revengeful feelings to take possession of
my heart? Oh, what a contrast to Thy gentleness and patience! I cannot
forget the least insult received, whilst Thou, O my God, at the first
sincere prayer for pardon wilt forget all the injuries that I have offered
Thee. Could I then fail to choose Thy Heart as a model for my own? But how
can this cold heart of mine ever resemble that kindest Heart of Thine?
Thou alone possessest the remedy. Behold me then, O sweet Jesus, and
mercifully regard a misery so profound. "My heart is ready, O God, my
heart is ready." I will extol Thee, O God my King, and I will bless Thy
name forever and ever.

Prayer.

Be Thou praised and blessed forever, O Sacred Heart of Jesus, Who in the
fervor of Thy charity, hast devised a miraculous means of filling hearts
with the holy flame of Thy divine love. Impress my heart so deeply with
this divine seal, that nothing may ever enter into it, or proceed from it,
that is not in conformity with Thy Sacred Heart. Amen.



Sixth Day. The Heart of Jesus My Comforter.


To whom can I more confidently tell my many needs and frailties than to
Him Who knows them more clearly than I do myself? Thy voice, O Jesus,
alone has the power to console and comfort the heart that loves Thee. They
are blind indeed who go in search of consolation and happiness from
creatures. Why did I not fly to Thee when I felt the first onset of this
world? I turned hither and thither, seeking on all sides for aid and
comfort, but I turned not my glance to Thee, Who alone canst rescue the
soul from sin. Heart of Jesus, oh, what manner of love is Thine! Forgive
my past foolishness, and now that I return again to Thee, give me grace
never to leave Thee. Let my soul, like Magdalen, rest at Thy sacred feet.
Stay with me, O Jesus, stay with me forever. Teach me what I must needs do
to live with Thee, and I shall trample under foot all the joy and gain
this world can offer me. I shall embrace with gladness for Thy sake all
afflictions and all sorrows. But, O my God, shelter beneath the wings of
Thy love every instant of my life, and encourage and strengthen my poor
weak heart.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I adore the admirable impulse which made Thee all
Thy life a victim of love, and led Thee to consummate it by a death of
perfect love. Grant that by Thy holy grace, my heart may become a living
sacrifice, desiring only to be offered up and to offer up all things for
Thy greater glory. Amen.



Seventh Day. The Heart of Jesus My Helper in Trials.


How few are there who love God alone for His own sake, and bless Him alike
in sorrow and in joy! Why, O my God, do I fear to travel on the royal road
of the cross--the only road that Thou hast travelled, and the shortest and
surest way to heaven? Do I forget that Thy cross sanctified and redeemed
the world, and formed the bliss of Thy elect in heaven? Why, then, do I
shrink from carrying it with courage? Let us remember that our union with
Jesus crucified will be the measure of our union with Him in glory. That
in suffering for Jesus we show our true love for Him. Oh, a thousand times
blessed are all who clasp the cross to their hearts and follow Jesus. Be
not sad, my soul, when thou art in pain: the Heart of Jesus was crushed
far more than thine. That sweet Heart of my Jesus was overwhelmed with
sadness at the sight of our sins, pierced with a thousand deadly shafts,
humiliated, abandoned by His Father: finally cruelly wounded on the cross,
shedding His blood, even to the last drop. Compare such sorrow with thine,
and yet thou darest complain! Jesus, forgive me, forgive such a vile
wretch, and crown Thy mercy and love.

Prayer.

O almighty and eternal God, look upon the Heart of Thy well-beloved Son,
and the praise and satisfaction He offers Thee in the name of poor
sinners. Have mercy upon them, since they ask it through this same Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the
Holy Ghost, one God forever and ever. Amen.



Eighth Day. In the Heart of Jesus I Shall Find Rest.


O Heart of my Jesus, I will cast myself with sweetest confidence into Thy
bosom, and I will rest on Him Who is the everlasting rest of the elect in
heaven. I will draw nigh unto Him Who can sweeten all the bitterness of my
weary pilgrimage here. I will rest, as John the beloved disciple did, on
the Heart of Jesus, and tell Him a hundred times over that peace and
comfort cannot be found elsewhere but in that sweet Heart. The Heart of
Jesus is the city of refuge, in which we are safe from the pursuit of the
enemy. It is the city of refuge, which defends us from the wrath of an
angry Judge. Give thy heart to Him, for He has opened His Heart to thee.
Give not thy heart to the world, but to Christ thy Lord. O Heart of Jesus!
Thou givest to the heart that loves Thee perfect peace, great joy of
spirit, and a foretaste of heaven's delight. My God, make me love Thee,
not coldly but with a passionate love. All for Thee, O my God, all for
Thee alone--let this be my watchword, and then only will I find true rest
and peace. May heaven and earth praise and bless Thee forever.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I unite my heart to the spirits of the blessed,
that with them it may sing to Thy glory before the throne of God. The Lamb
that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and
strength, and glory, and benediction. By Thy virtue guard my heart, and
preserve it from the stains of its own sinful desires. Amen.



Ninth Day. The Heart of Jesus an Ocean of Love.


O Heart of Jesus! Thou hast, in the greatness of Thy love, come down to
put on the garb of humanity, and to take into Thy breast man's heart--to
make him a source of Thy delights: to soothe the pain that sin inflicts on
his wretched soul. O God of love, what then shall I do for Thee Who hast
loved me with such an excess of love? What return can I make for such
great graces? Ah, yes! I will address Thee with the sweet name of
"Father," a God so generous and so great, and how easy will it be for me
to love Thee, O Jesus, my best Friend. In thus dwelling among us He willed
to unite Himself with us in a way as intimate as it is incomprehensible.
And to bring about this, He instituted the Sacrament of the Altar, and
shutting Himself up under the appearance of bread, He enters into our
hearts and makes His own flesh our nourishment. This gift of the
Eucharist, O my God, is of all Thy wonders the very crown. In this banquet
of love, Thou hearest all our sighs and complaints, and Thou forgivest all
our sad errors and foolishness. O happy Christians, what a source of
happiness we possess! Let us then give Him all the love and gratitude He
has a right to expect from us. Let our love be as unlimited as the love
Our God has shown unto us. O Jesus, how sweet it would be to live for Thee
and Thee only!

Prayer.

O my good Jesus, within Thy Heart, with sweetness overflowing, I place
myself; hide me deep therein that I may never stray away. In life my joy,
in death my guide, be Thou unto me my bliss in heaven. This I ask for
every one, and I ask it by Thy tears, Thy sweat, Thy sacred blood. Amen.



Tenth Day. The Ingratitude of Men to the Heart of Jesus.


Wherever we cast our eyes we meet with sad proofs of the ingratitude of
men to the Heart of Jesus. A large portion of the Christian world is
plunged in heresy, denying Christ's presence in the mystery of the Altar,
and not satisfied with refusing to recognize this great benefit they have
lifted their sacrilegious hand against the sacred Host. But, O divine
Jesus, behold a still more grievous source of sorrow to Thy Heart! It is
not from Jews or heretics that Thou receivest these insults, but from
Thine own chosen people, the people who profess to believe in Thy real
presence. Jesus is in our midst, we know it, and yet He is the only One
Whom we forget, the only One Whom we treat with careless indifference. It
is thus that Christians respond to the love of Our Lord; it is thus they
repay all His benefits. O sweet Jesus, pardon my base ingratitude! Angels
of heaven, you who know so much better than I the full extent of the love
of Jesus' Heart towards me, praise Him for me, and bless Him. O my God,
grant that I may live poor, unknown, and hidden in the Sacred Heart of
Jesus, my divine Master, forgotten and despised by creatures, so that Thou
mayest establish Thy reign of love upon my nothingness. I hope that Thou
wilt mercifully hear my request, and grant it.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, my Lord! O noblest, greatest, and most generous
of all hearts! I adore the divine impulses which led Thee, from the moment
of Thy conception, to love me who was nothing, who would offend Thee in so
many ways, and so often misuse Thy graces. O holy Friend of hearts, change
my heart, and make it choose Thee for its only Friend. Amen.



Eleventh Day. The Gratitude Due to the Heart of Jesus.


If it were in my power, I would return Thee unceasing acts of
thanksgiving, and they would still be too little to praise Thee for Thy
boundless love. I thank Thee and bless Thee for having poured out Thy most
precious blood to wash away my sins. Thou didst reserve nothing for
Thyself, Thou didst become dry and barren as a grape trodden in the wine-
press. O ardent love, that is never extinguished! would that I burned with
this fire Thou hast sent on the earth, and which Thou dost so fervently
desire to see kindled in souls! O most sweet Jesus, open to me, I humbly
beseech Thee, the door of Thy Heart, the door of love and mercy. There
only will my troubled soul find sure refuge, my crimes pity and
forgiveness. To Thee alone, O Heart of Jesus, I have recourse; assist Thou
me. Thou hast sought for me so painfully and so long, O my God, when I
strayed from Thy loving care. Behold me here now; I give myself to Thee.
With the help of Thy grace I will be faithful to Thee, and will keep my
soul in spotless purity and deepest humility. O Heart of my God, prevent
me from ever abandoning Thee again! May my heart be always open and ready
to admit Jesus, my well beloved. Let me cling to Thy feet, like Magdalen,
and give Thee love for love.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, my Saviour, I adore Thee, shedding tears over my
sins. Would that I had a fountain of tears in my heart, that I might weep
as I ought for the sorrows I have caused Thee! Give me grace to bring
forth worthy fruits of penance. I adore Thee, O King of hearts, Who art
the delight of heaven and earth! Amen.



Twelfth Day. In the Heart of Jesus is Found the Way, the Truth, and the
Life.


O my Jesus, I have never found truth save in Thee, and aside from Thy
paths I have never met but vanity and wrong. If Thou dost not guide me in
all things, I shall stray about forever, and will quickly perish through
fatigue and want. Speak, then, O Lord, speak to Thy servant, and grant him
to comprehend Thy wonderful love. Heart of my God, give me to see that
Thou art the only way in which I must walk, if I wish to walk aright. What
would ever become of me if Thou wert not my life, principally in the
Adorable Sacrament of the Altar, where Thou dwellest actually, corporally,
and perpetually, waiting to receive my homage and ever ready to give me
all graces and blessings. Oh, how boundless is my need of Thee, my God;
draw me unto Thee and dispel the darkness which surrounds me. Deign to
accept, O Heart divine, this poor desire. My God, Thou art my Father; have
pity on me according to the greatness of Thy mercy. I abandon myself to
Thee: do not reject me; make me love Thee and nevermore separate Thyself
from me.

Prayer.

O sacred Heart of Jesus, Thou art the heavenly light! Thou dispellest the
darkness of the soul, and fillest it with sweetness. Thou art the Heart of
hearts, and worthy of the greatest love. Thou art the source of that
heavenly fire that enlightens and burns. Inflame my heart with Thy divine
ardor, that it may burn with love of Thee to all eternity. Amen.



Thirteenth Day. To the Heart of Jesus Alone I Turn.


We are made for God alone, nor can we find peace elsewhere save in God
alone. But who can kindle in us Thy love, if not Thou Thyself, O Lord? Oh,
then, sweet Heart of Jesus, I will not cease to knock at the portal of Thy
Heart, with tears and true contrition! Let others seek the perishable
goods of this world. For my part I ask but Thee alone. Forgive my past
unfaithfulness, and unite me so closely to Thee that I may never be able
to forsake Thee. Yes, my Saviour, I will leave creatures and all earthly
pleasures to run after Thee in the Sacrament of Thy love. But I am ashamed
to appear before Thee, O my Jesus, I, who am so naked and so devoid of all
virtues. What then am I to do? Am I to appear no more before Thee? Ah, no!
this would not please Thee. Thou dwellest in the Sacrament, not only to
reward Thy lovers, but also to provide for the poor out of Thy riches. I
adore Thee, then, King of my heart! O Shepherd, loving Thy sheep beyond
all bounds, to this throne of love I now approach, and having nothing else
to give I offer Thee my poor heart. Mercy, O Heart of God, I implore Thee
a thousand, thousand times, and pardon for all my sins; grant that this
may be the day of my entire conversion, so that I may nevermore cease to
love Thee.

Prayer.

Heart of my Jesus, Thou knowest what is wanting in me: Thou knowest that
without Thee I can do nothing. Thou knowest my weakness: have pity on me,
give me humility, purity of heart, love, and conformity to Thy holy will,
strength against my bad habits, remission of my sins, and grace nevermore
to commit them. Amen.



Fourteenth Day. The Heart of Jesus Asks for Our Hearts.


"My child, give Me thy heart." Oh, let me print on my memory such a phrase
of love! "My child!" Oh, how sweet it sounds when uttered by the lips of a
God! He wishes to dwell in our hearts, not for a certain time, but
forever; not as a guest only, but as its Master and its Lord. Jesus says
the heart He asks of me is mine: "Give Me thy heart," instead of claiming
it as His right, as a matter of strictest obligation, since all that I am
and have comes from Him. Oh, why should it be so difficult for me to yield
up my heart to that sweet Lord Who so endearingly says, "My child, give Me
thy heart"? The name of friend being insufficient to tell all Thy love, O
dear Jesus, Thou dost employ the loving name of child to sweetly compel me
to grant Thy fond request. Why is it, my Jesus, that Thou wishest my love?
Why dost Thou, by every means, try to gain, by permission, that love which
is Thine by every right and title? Oh, how many years Thou hast followed
me, and I ever fled away from Thee! How hardened my heart was! It is true
I have often returned to Thee for a little while, and Thou didst welcome
me, and gave me Thy very self as my food. But too soon I fled away from
Thee again. O my dearest Jesus, what favors and benefits I have abused!
Pardon me, sweet Jesus: behold me at last here at Thy feet, never to leave
Thee more. Take my heart, sweet Lord, and clasp it tightly to Thy Sacred
Heart even to the hour of my death; never let me stray from Thee again.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, with my whole soul I adore Thy impulses of
goodness and mercy towards sinners, the effects of which I have most
singularly experienced! Thy loving kindness is so desirous of mercy, that
it threatens to show no mercy to him who is not merciful. And what mercy
can I exercise towards my neighbor? What can be compared to those mercies
I have received, and every day receive from Thee? O Heart of Jesus, loving
fountain of mercy, teach me to know and worthily imitate Thy mercy. Amen.



Fifteenth Day. The Heart of Jesus at the Hour of Death.


The life of man passes away as a shadow. Time passes by as a swift flowing
river, bearing on its bosom, onward to the grave, old and young, rich and
poor, without any distinction. Oh, how happy is he who has laid up
treasures in heaven, who has gathered for himself a hoard of merit before
God. Happy, a thousand times happy, is he who in that dread hour can turn
to God with all confidence, and feel God present in his heart. O my sweet
Jesus, I will cling to the hope that Thou wilt forget all my past
iniquities, and remember only Thy love. O merciful Jesus, who would not
hope from Thee a mercy without end? It is true Thou art a God of justice
and purity, and Thou seest in me sins beyond compare. But yet can it be
that the same God, Who every instant of my life yearns to be near me, Who
begs so pleadingly for my heart: can it be that He will condemn me to
hell? Oh, no, tender Heart of my Jesus! it will never be so if I am truly
sorry. My sweet Jesus will never abandon me, if with a truly repentant
heart, I have recourse to Him. Why should I fear death when I look upon my
God agonizing in the throes of death? His death was to help me in my dying
hour, so that seeing the pain that I have inflicted I might bear mine
without complaint. O sweet Heart of Jesus, I offer Thee my death. I am
willing to suffer all the pains Thou wishest to send me. Let me suffer as
much as Thou pleasest, only let me die clasped close to Thy loving Heart.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I adore the admirable impulses which made Thee
all Thy life a victim of love, and led Thee to consummate it by a death of
perfect love. Grant that, by Thy holy grace, my heart may become a living
sacrifice, desiring only to be offered up and to offer up all things for
Thy greater glory. Amen.



Sixteenth Day. The Heart of Jesus for all Eternity.


Eternity is Thine, O my God, and Thou givest it to Thy elect, that they
may love Thee without any doubt or fear. Life is short: the last hour may
toll for me when I least expect it. O thou city of God, when shall I
behold thy beauty? Oh, the grace and blessing of dying at peace with Thee,
great God; of closing our eyes in a holy death, to open them amid the
splendors of eternal joy! Meanwhile Thou givest me a pledge of this bliss
in the admirable Sacrament of the Altar. Where can love like Thine be
found? Thou givest me Thy body and blood, Thy soul and divinity, as a
pledge of eternal happiness. If then, Thou art wholly mine, can I be
otherwise than wholly Thine? A thousand thanks to Thee, O my sweet Jesus,
Who art so loving to me. Thou didst call me to Thy service, but I have
responded weakly. I often disappointed and displeased Thee, yet, O Heart
of my God, Thou art all mercy, and Thou wilt not turn away Thy face from
Thy poor child, who casts herself down before Thee in contrition and
shame. I will clasp Thy feet and remain there until Thou wilt once more
say "thou art forgiven: go in peace." Thou art just, O Lord; nevertheless
be moved to pity me. I promise that I will always serve and love Thee, and
avoid anything that could in any way separate me from Thee.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I adore Thy death of complete charity that placed
Thee in the grave. Let me enter into the wound of Thy Heart, made by the
lance, and may I die there for love of Thee. O heart of Mary, Mother of
the Heart of Jesus, I have recourse to thee, that thou mayest speak to me
in its stead. The Heart of Jesus and thine are but one, and what thou dost
for me He will approve.



Seventeenth Day. The Heart of Jesus Sorrowful unto Death.


No one can be a true follower of Thee, O sweet Jesus, who travels by any
road save that of Thy cross. For what trouble, what trial or affliction
can we meet with, which has not been suffered by Thee? What were the
agonies and pains Thy Heart bore for me! I am poor, but am I poorer than
Thou, Who hadst not whereon to lay Thy head? I may be reviled and
persecuted, but what are my persecutions in comparison to Thine, O my
Jesus? Thou wast abandoned in Thy hour of agony even by Thy apostles, and
betrayed into the hands of Thy enemies by one whom Thou hadst made Thy
friend and companion. Thy whole life, O my Jesus, was one unbroken series
of crosses, borne sweetly and patiently through love of me. Take courage,
then, my soul, from the example of our dear Lord, and bear with noble
strength all the trials and afflictions that may be sent to thee. I will
keep my eyes fixed on Thee, cursed and buffeted, insulted and spat upon,
scourged and crowned with thorns, a heavy cross laid upon Thy poor,
mangled shoulders, and Thy dreadful crucifixion--all for love of me. Surely
then, my God, the desire will grow in my heart to be ready and willing to
make some return to Thee. Yet without Thy help, dear Jesus, I am utterly
helpless to bear the little trials Thou so lovingly dost send me. Thou
hast said clearly, "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself,
and take up his cross and follow Me." And again, "Whosoever doth not carry
his cross and come after Me, cannot be My disciple." I understand then,
dear Jesus, that if I wish to claim the name of follower of Thee, I must
imitate Thee in carrying the cross. I throw myself into Thy loving arms,
my sweet Jesus; do with me as Thou choosest, only give me strength and
courage to abide with Thee forever.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I adore Thy impulses of charity, which made Thee
wish to fill my heart and my soul with Thine, my spirit with Thy spirit,
and to feed my body with Thy sacred flesh. I adore Thy divinity, concealed
from my sight under the symbols of Thy mystery of love, and I beseech
Thee, of Thy mercy, to use my soul, my mind, my heart, and my body as a
temple consecrated to Thy honor. O Sacred Heart, I adore Thee as a victim
sacrificed by the ascendancy and power of its own pure love. Amen.



Eighteenth Day. O Heart of Jesus, Thou Art All Mine and I Am All Thine.


Heart of my God, Thou art for me light, hope, heaven, eternity, all. I
thank Thee, sweetest Jesus, for all Thy generosity towards Thy unworthy
creature. I scarcely know myself when I feel Thee so near my heart in holy
communion. Oh, let that love of Thine fill my heart; do not leave me till
Thou grantest me the comfort I hope and claim of Thee. Lord, were I to ask
of Thee temporal things, Thou mightest well refuse them, but I ask that
which thou Thyself art pleased with--Thy holy love. I cannot love Thee
unless Thou grantest me power to do so. Heart of my Jesus, where shall I
find Thee if not where Thou art really present--in the Adorable Eucharist?
Be Thou blessed a thousand times, my Jesus, Who hast provided so sweet a
source of comfort for us poor exiles in this vale of tears. I behold
Magdalen approach Thee, her heart full of shame, and I behold her leaving
Thee, her heart full of peace and love. I see Augustine filled with the
malice of sin, and all at once he becomes one of Thy brightest saints. Is,
then, Thy power shortened? No, no, Thou never failest in coming to those
who in lowliness of heart cry to Thee for help. Let me, then, O my sweet
Jesus, show Thee all my sorrow and reveal to Thee all my need. If I had
loved Thee as warmly as I have loved myself and my sins, I would have been
a saint long ago. Now once more I return to Thee; let my hope never be
confounded.

Prayer.

Be Thou blessed and praised forever, O Sacred Heart of Jesus, hidden under
the mystical veil of the consecrated Host! Grant that I may worthily
praise Thy ardent love. Thou art all in all to the saints in heaven. Give
me Thy grace, that to me also Thy Sacred Heart may become all things, and
that I may love and adore Thee in spirit and in truth. Amen.



Nineteenth Day. God is Charity and He Who Lives in Charity Lives in God.


The Heart of Jesus, a great saint has said, is the abode of every virtue,
the source of every blessing; always filled with love for us, it is ever
ready to receive, to shelter, and to comfort us. O you who are bending
under the burden of sorrow or want, or who are forever struggling against
temptation, fly to this sweet Heart; there you shall find that God is
love, that He is ever attentive, and ever prepared to hear our slightest
prayer. Oh, then, merciful Heart of my Jesus, be with me everywhere, even
when I do not ask Thee, because then the peril is much greater. Stretch
out Thy hand to me and draw me unto Thee. Thou hast told Magdalen that
much was forgiven her because she had loved much; but was it not Thyself,
sweet Jesus, that gave her such love? Give me the same love, my Jesus, and
I shall love Thee as much. Ah, my Jesus, my heart is no longer mine--I give
it to Thee without reserve. Let it live for Thee and Thee only; keep it, O
Lord, and guard it as Thine own. If the angels rejoice over the returning
of the repentant prodigal, wilt Thou not find greater delight in that
prodigal's sincere desire of thanking Thee and loving Thee more and more?
I resolve that my heart will henceforward bear Thee company by visiting
Thee in Thy tabernacles, and by fidelity to prayer.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, Who in a wonderful Sacrament hast left us a
memorial of Thy Passion and a pledge of Thy love, grant us, I beseech
Thee, grace so to venerate the mysteries of Thy body and blood, that we
may ever feel within us the fruits of Thy redemption, Who livest and
reignest with the Father, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God forever and
ever. Amen.



Twentieth Day. The Sacred Heart is a Most Patient Rewarder.


Thou, O sweet Jesus, possessest all wealth and bounty; we know that Thy
riches are inexhaustible, and that Thy desire to impart them in Thy
generosity is without limit and immeasurable. Thy rewards are always far
greater than our merits. For a very slight service, Thou givest so amply
that the greatness and depth of Thy rewards will be equal to their
duration. Jesus, light of my life, shine on my poor, wretched soul, and
plant in it the precious fruits of hatred of sin, deep contrition, and a
firm, lasting resolution of amendment. Make this poor heart of mine gladly
embrace and bear all the crosses that Thou mayest send me as aids to the
attainment of my only end--that of abiding safe in Thy bright home forever,
sweet Jesus, with Thee. However great the sufferings of this life may be,
we can all have recourse to God, and obtain strength and courage in the
thought that Thou, dear Lord, hast been the first of all great sufferers,
and that Thou wilt never permit our troubles to exceed our limited
strength. Oh, how sweetly and lovingly dost Thou receive the soul who,
notwithstanding temptation and trials, hast always served Thee faithfully,
and hast persevered to the end in Thy service! O my sweet Love, aid me by
Thy grace to bear all afflictions with loving patience, so that I may one
day receive my everlasting reward.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, which from all time wast inflamed with love for
the glory of Thy heavenly Father, and for our salvation, be Thou praised
and blessed forever! Kindle in our hearts that divine fire Thou hast
brought upon the earth, and grant that we may never, on our side, oppose
it, but that by Thy holy grace it may ever burn there. Amen.



Twenty-first Day. The Heart of Jesus will Glorify us in Heaven.


My Jesus, when will that moment come, when having followed faithfully the
path of crosses and tribulations, I shall hear Thee say, "Well done, good
and faithful servant; because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I
shall place thee over many. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." Oh, the
joy the soul will feel when, on reaching heaven, she shall find herself in
the company of the angels and saints; of Mary, her good Mother, and shall
recognize all her friends and relatives! What joy will it not be to find
one's self safe in port, free from all danger, safe forever in the arms of
God! The happiness of heaven once insured is ours forever more; it cannot
be lost. There will be no more sorrow nor trouble. Thou, O my sweet Jesus,
wilt wipe away all tears from our eyes, and with Thy sweet voice, Thou
wilt gladden our hearts. My soul, enter into thyself, and reflect that
thou wert made for this glory if thou wilt only struggle to the end. How
foolish then is he, who for a brief passing moment of pleasure, would
fling away all claim to that glory, which as St. Paul says, "Eye hath not
seen nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man what
things God hath prepared for them that love Him." Take courage, my soul,
and do not murmur against those trifling tribulations, which God in His
mercy sends for our own true weal. Most loving Jesus, give me grace to
welcome them, to embrace them eagerly, and to bear them according to Thy
good pleasure, and with sincere resignation to Thy holy will. O my sweet
Jesus, grant that I may one day reach that joyful kingdom, there to unite
my voice to those of the ever blest ones who, with ceaseless transports of
joy, cry out before Thy throne, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts;
heaven and earth are full of the glory of Thy majesty.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, Victim of love, consecrated Altar where all
sacrifices are completed, Thou art the glory of the Holy Trinity, the joy
of the angels and all the blessed, and the unfailing hope of mortals. Be
Thou the sole Master of the desires and affections of my heart. O Heart of
Jesus, that lovest me so tenderly, make me love Thee fervently in this
world, so that I may love Thee eternally in heaven. Amen.



Twenty-second Day. The Heart of Jesus Opened.


Jesus, even after His death, allowed His sacred side to be opened by a
spear-thrust, in order that we might see with what good-will He had
suffered, and how ardently He was inflamed with love of us, and with
desire for our salvation. This opening of the side of Jesus, and the
wonderful shedding of blood and water, should fill us with a sweet
gladness, tempered with tears of sorrow for our evil. The only time in
which we wounded not His Heart was that time in which we had not yet been
furnished by nature with that dangerous weapon, our natural liberty, the
origin of all our offences against God. He could have deprived us of that
free will which has been the instrument by which we have offended Him so
often; but no, He comes unto us with all love, disclosing to us all the
sweetness of His kind Heart. O my Saviour, Thou never ceasest to renew Thy
loving assaults! Thou didst wait on me, yearning to enfold me in Thy
divine embrace. O peerless mercy of my Jesus' Heart, how can I ever repay
Thee? Heart of my Jesus, I shall endeavor to prove my love for Thee by
atoning as far as is in my power for the many insults offered Thee. I
shall adore and love Thee to the utmost of my power, I shall visit Thee,
hidden as Thou art in the Holy Sacrament of the Altar, and delight in
holding sweet converse with Thee. Thy side is open wide: for whom, if not
for poor sinners? O my sweet Jesus, I can enter therein at will. In Thy
Sacred Heart I can find true sorrow, and contrition for all my ingratitude
and thanklessness. Oh, give my heart steadiness and fidelity, that so
these resolutions may be effectual and practical.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, Who with incomparable love didst vouchsafe to be
crowned with thorns, blindfolded, and struck with a reed, stripped of Thy
garments, nailed to the cross, and lifted up thereon between two thieves:
to have gall and vinegar given Thee to drink, to be wounded with a spear:
I beseech Thee, O Sacred Heart, by all these pains, and by Thy cross and
death, to deliver me from all that displeases Thee and in Thy mercy to
lead me whither Thou didst conduct the penitent thief. Who livest and
reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost, God, forever and ever. Amen.



Twenty-third Day. The Heart of Jesus the Source of All Happiness.


There is one thing for which every heart craves, after its own manner. We
all long for happiness--that is the one great desire that lives in every
soul. Hast Thou not, sweet Jesus, given us that longing? And when Thou
hast given so much surely Thou wilt not refuse the accomplishment of this
desire also. Tell us, dear Lord, what souls are happy, and we will learn
from their example. Let us look at the faces of those who serve Thee, and
we will see them growing brighter and brighter as they draw near Thee, and
they will tell us. When we love Thee sincerely, then we shall be happy;
when we make Thy will the centre around which we move, then we shall be
happy; when Thy sweet Heart, hidden under the sacramental species, is more
beautiful in our sight than all else, when we shape and mould our lives
according to the example of that Sacred Heart, then peace and joy and
happiness will be ours. Teach us, sweet Heart of Jesus, from Thy
tabernacle, to serve Thee as Thou deservest, to love Thee above all
things, to work for Thee bravely and generously, solely because of Thy
love and not for Thy gifts. Oh, what happiness may I not promise myself if
I but cling to Thy most generous Heart, and use my best endeavors to
faithfully serve, adore, and love it. Inflame my heart, O Jesus, with the
fire of love with which Thine is ever inflamed. With St. Ignatius I will
say, "Jesus, Lord, give to me Thy love and grace divine, and I shall be
rich enough." Henceforth I accept the remainder of my life and all its
events, whether bitter or sweet, from Thee; fixing my eyes on the
tabernacle alone, I will serve Thee because it is Thy will I should do so.
Help me, my Jesus, unto the end; let me find no happiness but in Thee.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, how blessed is he whose only hope and confidence
is in Thee, Who alone canst satisfy the yearnings of his heart! Thou art
indeed the light of our true heavenly land, the delights of which surpass
all that our human senses can experience. Too late have I known Thee, O
ancient beauty! Too late have I loved Thee! But if I have begun so late,
make me now love Thee perfectly. Amen.



Twenty-fourth Day. The Love of the Saints for the Heart of Jesus.


What a contrast there is between my conduct and that of Thy saints--between
my indifference and their love towards Thy sweet Heart in the Blessed
Sacrament! St. John Francis Regis, when worn out with labor, would retire
to the church and would there find repose and rest at the feet of Jesus.
St. Francis Xavier used to pass the night and take his repose in the
sacristy, so as to be near Jesus. Leopold, Duke of Austria, would dismount
from his horse, and falling on his knees would adore his Saviour as the
procession of the Blessed Sacrament passed him by. It is true that I
cannot, nor does Jesus expect me to imitate these bright examples; yet if
I have the will and the desire I can do much. Could I not often think of
Jesus, lonely in the Blessed Sacrament, waiting and watching for me, His
poor creature, to visit Him? Could I not, like St. Alphonsus, visit the
Blessed Sacrament every day? Could I not, when I bend my knee before Him,
say "Blessed and praised be the Adorable Sacrament of the Altar?" Could I
not refrain from useless talk in church? Could I not easily assist at
Benediction as often as it takes place in church? All this I could do, O
loving Heart of Jesus, if I only cared for Thee, if the love of Thee had
taken full possession of my soul. But I am weak, O Jesus, and ever prone
to thwart Thy adorable intentions; still I am comforted by the thought
that Thou wilt aid and sustain me. This urges me to pray, in fullest hope
of obtaining all things conducive to my sanctification here, and my
salvation hereafter. Perfect my desires, I implore Thee, and let the
example of Thy saints stimulate me to love Thee in the Blessed Sacrament
more and more.

Prayer.

O Sacred Heart of Jesus, Thou art the source of the joy and holiness of
the saints, and from Thy fulness we receive all that we can have or wish
for in heaven and on earth. Through Thy charity, and through that of the
heart of Thy holy Mother, I beseech Thee to bestow on me the sweet peace
of charity, and to make my heart ever yielding and obedient to the
impulses of Thy divine grace. Amen.



Twenty-fifth Day. The Agony of the Heart of Jesus.


The Heart of Jesus is filled with terror at the sight of the torments that
await Him. He seems to forget what He is and why He came into this world.
He prostrates Himself on the ground, and beseeches His Father to remove
from Him, if possible, the chalice of suffering which He sees in store for
Him. His agony is so intense that He is covered with a sweat of blood,
which oozes out in great drops and trickles down to the ground. O my soul,
hast thou ever beheld a sight like this? Only Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who
has loved man, has suffered like this. O my Jesus, my sweet Jesus, Thou
hast willingly suffered the divine vengeance which should have fallen on
me. What more couldst Thou have done for me? Surely if our hearts are
human, if there is one fibre of pity or gratitude in our souls, the memory
of Thy agony would never be obliterated. By Thy presence on the altar,
Thou has made me acknowledge the enormity of my sins. Thou hast compelled
me to own that my sins have, as far as they could, reacted every scene in
Thy Passion. And yet do I linger under the shadow of Thy tabernacle? Do I
weep over the wounds I have made in Thy body? Oh, no, dear Jesus! I have
forgotten Thee, and like the Jews, with Thy blood on my hands, I have
eaten and made merry. O tender Heart of Jesus, let it be so no more. Let
my heart be filled with sorrow on account of my iniquities. Let my
repentance be like Magdalen's; then I shall be happy and I shall be saved,
because Thou wilt never despise a truly contrite heart. O loving Jesus,
make my heart so just, so upright, and so conformable to Thy Heart, that
between Thee and me there may be nothing to offend Thee.

Prayer.

I adore Thee, Sacred Heart of Jesus, suffering in the Garden of Olives. It
is I who deserve all the pains Thou endurest, for I am the cause of them.
O Sacred Heart of Jesus, through Thy sorrow my soul finds consolation, and
by Thy agony my death is made sweet. Give me a contrite and humble heart,
that can participate in Thy pains and sorrows. Teach me how to offer up
the prayer of suffering and patience. Amen.



Twenty-sixth Day. The Heart of Jesus in the Tabernacle.


The home of Jesus is the tabernacle. Our dear Lord and Saviour dwells
among the poor as well as among the rich. He lives in the noisy, crowded
city, as well as in the lonely, quiet country; in magnificent cathedrals,
as well as in the poorest churches and the most dilapidated chapels. There
He remains, that all may be able to come to His dwelling-place, to lay
before Him all their wants, to converse with Him and to obtain from Him
all the graces they need, whether for soul or body. Can we imagine
anything more loving or generous? The soul that truly loves Jesus need not
go far to find Him. He can be found in every church in which the Blessed
Sacrament is kept, and there the King of kings, Our Lord and Saviour, is
content to remain, shut up in a tabernacle of wood, with no one to keep
Him company. Well has He been called a "Prisoner of love." O sweet Heart
of Jesus, because Thou art always with us, we forget Thee; because we are
accustomed to Thy continual presence we heed it no more. Because Thou
never leavest us, we grow tired of Thee and value Thee not. O loving Heart
of Jesus, what ingratitude! Yet surely it ought not to be difficult to
visit Thee and to converse with Thee. How many afflictions, how many
troubles of mind and body, are there to tell Thee; how many graces and
blessings to supplicate; how many sins and transgressions are there to
weep for; how many acts of love and thanksgiving to be poured forth for
all Thy numberless mercies; how many petitions ought to ascend for the
conversion of those who neither know nor love Thee! O compassionate Jesus,
grant that we may ever remember Thee in Thy loving Sacrament, and let Thy
dear words ever sound in our ears: "Come to Me, all you that labor and are
heavily burdened, and I will refresh you."

Prayer.

I adore Thee, O Sacred Heart of Jesus, the joy, the satisfaction, and the
supreme Ruler of all hearts. With the same loving kindness that led Thee
to take the hand of St. Thomas, and carry it Thyself into Thy side, make
my heart seek no joy but in Thee, O Sacred Heart. May my heart be ever
subject to Thy gentle sway, for out of Thee it will find but labor and
tribulation, and all the consequences of its unhappy bondage. Amen.



Twenty-seventh Day. The Heart of Jesus is My Hope.


In the Heart of Jesus we live, and move, and have our being. O Jesus, Thy
care of me is so wise and gentle, that nothing can harm me so long as I
leave myself in Thy hands. I know the trials which Thou sendest me are
irksome, that my passions goad me on to rise up against Thee, and the
demon also whispers in my ear, "Thou hast Jesus no longer, He has
abandoned thee for aye." But no, never will I lose my hope in Thee; I
shall not be affrighted; remembering the loving lessons Thy Heart has
taught me, I will fear no evils. Too powerful in the strength, my God,
that comes to me from the assurance that Thou, sweet Love, rulest my life
and art a sharer in all my sorrow. No, I will not fear, for Thou art with
me. With Jesus, my God, by my side, my hope acquires new strength. I have
with me a Father Who loves me and Who is ever intent on blessing me. My
eyes behold Thee not, yet through the wondrous agency of Thy grace, Thou
art near to me at every place and at every moment. Be Thou then, sweet
Jesus, my comforter, my delight, my crown. My senses will murmur, it is
true, my passions will arise in rebellion, but fortified by Thy grace and
strength, I will fight against sin with a fortitude invincible. Aid me
then, O divine Heart, for Thou art my only hope. Let me rest and repose on
Thy bosom and forget my wanderings. Let me learn that there and there
only, I am in my true home, where alone I can be happy.

Prayer.

O most compassionate Jesus! Thou alone art our salvation, our life and our
resurrection. We implore Thee, therefore, do not forsake us in our needs
and afflictions, but by the agony of Thy most Sacred Heart and by the
sorrows of Thy immaculate Mother, succor Thy servants whom Thou hast
redeemed with Thy most precious blood. Amen.



Twenty-eighth Day. All Graces Come from the Heart of Jesus.


All virtues are found in the Heart of Jesus. His Heart is the furnace of
divine love, always burning with the fire of the Holy Spirit, purifying,
kindling, and transforming into Himself all who yield themselves to Him,
or who wish to be His. "My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready." I
will extol Thee, O God, my King, and I will bless Thy name forever. Since
all good flows from Thy most sweet Heart, O Jesus, I should not attribute
to myself anything of the good I may have done, nor regard with self-
satisfaction the gifts of God, but ascribe all to Him, and return all to
their original source, which is the Heart of Jesus. Place all your sins in
the Heart of Jesus. Through that Heart you should ask for grace and
pardon, and praise and bless Him for all His mercies. I acknowledge, O my
God, Thy supreme dominion over me, and all created things. I bow down
before Thy infinite sanctity, perfection and excellence, which entitle
Thee to the fullest love, service, and praise of all Thy creatures. In Thy
presence I protest my detestation of my countless sins, with which I have
outraged Thy love, and deeply repentant, I implore of Thee a full pardon.
Open wide Thy Heart of love, and let stream on my heart all the full
sympathy of Thine. I know Thou canst not trust me, as I am ever prone to
break my word and betray Thee. Hence I need all Thy care, all Thy grace to
persevere in the good resolutions Thou formest in my soul. O sweet Virgin
Mother of my Jesus, help me to praise and bless the Lord for all the
benefits He has bestowed on me, and for all those He will grant for all
eternity.

Prayer.

My sweet Jesus, I give Thee my soul, my body, and my will, resigning
myself in all and forever to Thy most holy grace. Do with me what Thou
pleasest. Make me ever love Thee in this life and in the next; do this,
and then dispose of me and of everything I have as Thou wilt. Tell me what
Thou askest of me; for with Thy grace I will execute it, be it what it
may. Amen.



Twenty-ninth Day. The Heart of Jesus the Source of Sanctity.


This adorable Heart offers to us at once the motive, the example, and the
grace of holiness. What could be more of an incentive to keep ourselves
from sin, than the remembrance of Our Lord's Sacred Heart, which was
saddened by sin to such an excess as to cause His sacred body to sweat
drops of blood? What more calculated to inspire us with zeal for our
sanctification than the study of this Heart, which calls us to it with so
much love, and by so many sacrifices? St. Bernardin of Sienna speaks of
this divine Heart as a furnace of the most ardent love, capable of setting
the whole world on fire. We find in the Heart of Jesus the grace of
holiness, for as Blessed Margaret Mary says, "Nothing is better calculated
to raise the soul in a very short time to the loftiest degree of holiness
than devotion to this dear Heart." She also says that those who labor for
the salvation of souls will find in this devotion the gift of touching the
hardest heart. It is because this divine Heart is the throne whereon mercy
is seated, that invocations made to it are never in vain. It is the strong
tower against which all temptations are powerless. It is the source of all
benedictions. Oh, we should love with all our strength the amiable Heart
of Jesus, no matter what it may cost us! We should sanctify ourselves at
any cost, and to do this we should love and burn incessantly in the
furnace of the pure love of God, which will purify and sanctify us at one
and the same time. Let us, then, abandon ourselves into the hands of God,
and we shall soon see that He will employ every means to make us perfect.
He who loves perfectly makes no resistance. My Jesus, take unto Thee my
heart; I give myself wholly to Thee. May I ever be scrupulously faithful
and unflinchingly constant in loving Thee, this day and every day of my
whole life.

Prayer.

O beloved One of my soul, would that I had always loved Thee! Alas, there
was a time when I not only did not love Thee, but despised Thy grace and
Thy love. I am consoled by the sorrow which I feel for it, and I hope for
pardon through Thy promise to forgive him that repents of his sins. To
Thee, O my Saviour, do I turn all my affections; help me, through the
merits of Thy Passion, to love Thee with my whole strength. Amen.



Thirtieth Day. The Heart of Jesus in Holy Communion.


Oh, how shall I dare to approach Thy heavenly banquet, that mystery which
is the greatest and most stupendous work of even Thy almighty love? that
banquet of which the noblest and purest spirits are in no sense truly
worthy? Yet I feel myself comforted, when I read in Thy Gospel that Thou
sendest forth Thy servants in quest of the poor, the blind, the lame, and
the wretched, to invite them to Thy bounteous feast divine. O goodness of
God! O Heart of Jesus, truly loving art Thou, and truly worthy of all
love. Not only willingly, but eagerly do I accept Thy sweet and merciful
invitation. What a consolation to be allowed to enjoy the loving embraces
of the divine Spouse of my soul! As the hart panteth after the fountains
of water, so my soul panteth after Thee, O God. Oh, come then, Heart of my
Jesus, come to Thy poor servant. I desire to tell Thee all my needs, to
protest to Thee my love, to clasp Thee to me. Come, and as Thou enterest
my heart, let me hear Thy sweet, consoling words, "Peace be to thee." Oh,
fortify me with Thy light and strength, that I may no more lose Thee or
drive Thee from me. But as long as I live, I am in danger--my resolution
may become weak and I may betray Thee as I have done before. O Love
unbounded, do Thou help me; from Thee and from Thy Heart, I hope all good.
Let not that hope grow weak at any time, nor waver for a single instant.
This I implore of Thee through the same love which has made Thee remain
with us day and night, and which has induced Thee to give Thyself for our
food in the Blessed Sacrament.

Prayer.

Remember, O most loving Jesus, that it is unheard of that any one ever had
recourse to Thy Sacred Heart, implored its help without obtaining relief.
Confiding in Thy infinite goodness and mercy we cast ourselves before
Thee, and do most humbly supplicate Thee to hear our prayers, and to take
upon Thyself the care of our salvation. Show, divine Jesus, that Thou hast
the Heart of the best of Fathers. Shelter us therein, and let it not be
said that we have perished, where no one ever found but mercy, grace and
salvation. Amen.

Mass in Union with the Sacred Heart of Jesus.


Introibo.

O divine Jesus, Thou art the Victim laden with all the iniquities of the
world: Thou didst shed bitter tears for them; Thou didst expiate them by
the most dreadful torments, and by the most cruel of deaths. I come to
mingle my tears with Thine; I confess to Thee, in the presence of Mary,
ever Virgin, and of all the saints, that I have sinned exceedingly; that
it is my ingratitude that pierced Thy Heart, and put Thee to a cruel
death. O God, my Saviour, through Thy tears, through Thy agony in the
Garden of Olives, through Thy precious blood and the wound in Thy Sacred
Heart, I beseech Thee to pardon me, and to grant me the remission of all
my sins. Amen.

Introit.

Let us adore the Heart of Jesus, which has loved us so much; let us
prostrate ourselves before Him, and bewail the sins of which we have been
guilty. Grant us, O Lord, a contrite and humble heart; let the homage of
our adoration be as acceptable to Thee as if we offered Thee thousands of
victims. Amen.

Kyrie.

The days of propitiation have arisen upon me; I may call Thee by Thy name,
O God of majesty; I may call Thee my Saviour and my Father. Thou art
present on our altars, that Thou mayest heap Thy favors upon us. I will
draw nigh, therefore, with confidence unto the throne of mercy, and I will
say unto Thee: Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner. Amen.

Gloria.

Glory be to God, Whose justice is satisfied by the perpetual sacrifice of
so noble a Victim. Peace and happiness on earth to men of good-will, who
behold a God annihilating Himself daily to save them, and to feed them
with His own substance. I praise Thee, I bless Thee, I adore Thee, O Lord,
and I stand amazed at the sight of the wonders of Thy love. Shall I suffer
them to be of no avail to me through the evil dispositions of my heart?
Shall I reject that peace which Thou offerest me? Shall I not labor to
acquire that good-will by which it comes? O my God, allay the strife which
is so often excited in my heart, making the flesh rebel against the
spirit. Amen.

Collect.

O Divine Jesus, inexhaustible fountain of all good things, open unto us,
we beseech Thee, the interior of Thy Heart: that, having entered by pious
meditation into this august sanctuary of divine love, we may fix forever
there our hearts, as the place wherein is found the treasure, rest and
happiness of holy souls; Who livest and reignest forever and ever. Amen.

Epistle.

"Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewed her out seven pillars.
She hath slain her victims, mingled her wine, and set forth her table. She
hath sent her maids to invite to the tower, and to the walls of the city:
Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me. And to the unwise she said:
Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.
Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence" (Prov.
ix. 1-6).

Gospel.

Praise, honor, and glory be to Thee, O Jesus, Saviour of the world! Who,
thirsting for the salvation of souls, didst endure for them so much labor
and fatigue; Who for their sakes didst pass entire nights in prayer, and
didst weary Thyself going from city to city, from village to village.
Grant, I implore Thee, that Thy love may also make me prompt and apt in
every good work, and that I may never grow tepid in Thy service. Help me
to know and practise the holy counsels contained in Thy Gospel, and grant
above all that I may penetrate the divine wisdom contained in Thy words:
"If any man will come after Me, let him take up his cross and follow Me."

Credo.

I believe, O my God, the truths which Thou hast revealed to Thy Church. I
desire to live and die in this faith. Grant, O Lord, that my life may be
conformable to my faith; that my faith may be animated by good works; that
I may never be ashamed to declare myself a Catholic, and may constantly
maintain the interests of Thy holy religion. O holy Roman Catholic Church,
the persecutions which thou hast endured, far from weakening my faith, do
but strengthen it the more, since thy divine Spouse foretold them. Sweet
Heart of Jesus, draw close the bonds that bind me to Thy holy Church; put
into my heart a spirit of perfect obedience to my lawful pastors. In its
bosom I became Thy child, and in its bosom I wish to live and die. Amen.

Offertory.

O Jesus, we draw near with confidence to Thy sweet Heart: cast upon us, we
beseech Thee, a look of pity, and make our hearts a perpetual offering
consecrated to Thy glory. O Heart of infinite goodness, I offer Thee my
heart; vouchsafe to change it, to bless and sanctify it. O my soul, how
Jesus Christ hath loved us! At what a price He hath redeemed us! Not with
gold, nor with riches, but by the voluntary shedding of His blood. He hath
sacrificed Himself for us: let us then live only for Him; let us sacrifice
ourselves together with Him. But, O my God, my heart is not full enough of
love and fervor to be an offering worthy of Thee. What then shall I give
Thee? I will give Thee Thy Son. That Son, the most worthy object of Thy
complacency, will supply my inability. O Lord, look not on me, but on this
divine offering. Amen.

Preface.

Lift up, O Lord, do Thou Thyself lift up my heart to Thee. Take from it
all unholy thoughts, all earthly affections. Lift it wholly up to heaven,
where Thy Heart is worthily adored, and to the altar, where it is about to
manifest itself to me. Through Thy most kind Heart, I beseech Thee to draw
my heart wholly into Thine. Bury it in Thine, so that it may be so
absorbed into and united to Thy Heart, that I may no longer have any heart
but Thine. Suffer me, then, to join my feeble voice with the voices of all
the heavenly spirits, and in union with them to say, in transports of joy
and admiration: Holy, holy, holy is the Heart of Jesus! the worthy object
of the divine complacency, and of the homage of heaven and earth! The
whole earth is full of Thy glory; let my heart be full also of its love.
Amen.

Canon.

O God infinitely holy, if my sins provoke Thee, and make me hateful in Thy
sight, look upon the Lamb without spot, Who is going to immolate Himself
to take away the sins of the world, and beholding His merits, remember not
my ingratitude. Remember only that I have been graciously admitted into
the Heart of Thy divine Son. This Heart infinitely merciful prayed for me
on Calvary, and will soon renew the sacrifice of itself for me. O my sweet
Jesus, how many times have I sinned against Thee? How many times have I
despised the interior graces Thou hast bestowed upon me? Oh, how earnestly
I now desire a perfect contrition, equal to the greatness of the love that
I have offended. But, since it is impossible for my sorrow to equal Thy
goodness towards me, I offer the loving contrition of the Heart of my Lord
Jesus Christ to supply my insufficiency. Amen.

Consecration.

O my soul, behold thy God, thy Saviour, thy Judge! My God, I adore Thee!
My Saviour, I love Thee! My sovereign Judge, I am sorry for ever having
offended Thee! O Heart of my Jesus, Whom I believe to be here really
present, suffer me not to be separated from Thee during life. Grant that
my heart may ever find repose in Thine, that I may die in Thy love, and
thus go to contemplate and praise Thee for all eternity. Amen.

After The Consecration.

The heavens are opened: the Holy of holies has descended on the earth:
this altar is now the throne where dwells the majesty of the Most High;
the angels surround Him, and with the most lively homage of reverence and
love, make reparation to Him for the contempt, the neglect, and the
indifference of men. O divine Lord, I lay all my petitions at Thy feet;
vouchsafe to present them to Thy Father. I pray for the conversion of
sinners, the perseverance of the just, and the triumph of our holy
religion. O Jesus, Who didst die for all men, bring back to the fold of
Thy Church those who are separated from it. Enlighten all infidels and
heretics, bless the efforts of those who labor to convert them. Have pity
on the souls of the faithful departed; remit to them their debts, and
grant them a place of refreshment, light, and peace. I beseech Thee
particularly to have compassion on (_name them_).

Pater Noster.

O my Father, if it be permitted that a guilty child call by so tender a
name a God Whom he hath so often offended, grant that I may ever labor for
the glory of Thy holy name, that in all things I may do Thy will, and sigh
unceasingly for Thy heavenly kingdom. Let the forgiveness which Thou didst
grant Thy murderers be my example in forgiving those who have injured me:
give me superiors, both spiritual and temporal, that love Thee, and
friends that serve Thee faithfully; and if ever I expose myself to sin, do
Thou deliver me from the danger, that I may never outrage Thy loving
Heart. Amen.

Agnus Dei.

Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of the world! Pure and spotless
Victim, Who alone canst satisfy the justice of an offended God, vouchsafe
to make me a partaker of the merits of Thy sacrifice! What lessons of
humility, meekness, charity and patience dost Thou give me! Impress these
virtues upon my heart, that it may be to Thee a pleasant habitation,
wherein Thou mayest repose, as in an abode of peace. Amen.

Communion.

O Christ, mighty Lord, most sweet Jesus, my strength and my refuge,
defender of my soul, God of my salvation! O Thou in Whom I believe and
hope, Thou Whom I love, behold I draw near to Thy throne of grace, I knock
at the door of Thy mercy, and beseech Thee to open it for me. Thou Who
didst promise entrance into paradise to the penitent thief, bring me,
through the most holy wound of Thy side, to the centre of Thy breast, and
let me drink at the fountain of wisdom that flows from Thy Heart. O God of
infinite mercy, receive me, enclose me, hide me in the bosom of Thy mercy.
Amen.

After Communion.

I have found Him Whom my soul loveth: I possess Him, and will nevermore
leave Him. What have I to desire in heaven, and what can I henceforth love
upon earth, but Thee, O my God, the God of my heart! O most loving Jesus,
were it possible, I would fain praise Thee as perfectly, love Thee as
ardently, serve Thee as faithfully, please Thee as completely, and
contribute to Thy glory as efficiently as do all angels and men
collectively and as each one does in particular. O most merciful Lord, God
of holiness, vouchsafe to cleanse my heart from all self-love and all
sinful affections. Make it a pleasing abode for Thee. Let it become like
unto Thy Heart, that Thou mayest delight to dwell in it forever. Amen.

Benediction.

O loving Heart of Jesus, I will not depart till Thou hast blessed me.
Bless me in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost!
and let Thy blessing descend upon all those for whom I ought to pray.
Amen.

Last Gospel.

O eternal Word, Who wast made man that Thou mightest make men the children
of God, I thank Thee for this unspeakable grace. How great is the blessing
I enjoy, not only of hearing the name, but of being indeed the child of
God! Grant, O my sweet Jesus, that I may preserve this blessed title, by
faithfully imitating Thy Sacred Heart, and showing myself always filled
with love for Thy holy law. If I remain faithful Thou assurest me that I
shall be co-heir with Thee, and shall enjoy the happiness which Thou hast
purchased for us with Thy precious blood: and this I hope to obtain
through Thy infinite mercy. Amen.

After Mass.

Soul of Christ, sanctify me:
Body of Christ, save me:
Blood of Christ, inebriate me:
Water from the side of Christ, wash me:
Passion of Christ, strengthen me:
O good Jesus, hear me:
Within Thy wounds hide me:
Permit me not to be separated from Thee.
From the malignant enemy defend me:
In the hour of my death call me,
And bid me come to Thee;
That, with Thy saints, I may praise Thee
Forever and ever. Amen.





JULY. THE PRECIOUS BLOOD.


Our Lord shed His blood for our ransom, to buy us from the slavery of the
devil and of sin. Not one drop of blood did He reserve for Himself; He
shed it all most generously in our behalf. He was the Lamb of God without
blemish, Who, according to God's designs for the redemption of mankind,
was to be sacrificed. His blood was to be shed on the cross; from five
great wounds it was to flow upon the earth, like the sacrifices of the Old
Testament. These sufferings were precious in the sight of God, the Father,
and gained for us the remission of our sins, the ransom from the slavery
of Satan. Every drop of this blood was all powerful, because it
represented the sacrifice of a God-man.

How precious are those drops of blood in the chalice on the altar at Mass,
when the sacred blood of Christ is offered daily to God for our salvation!
How we desire to drink that blood, that we may have life in us, for the
Lord has said, "Unless you drink of My blood, you shall not have life in
you." How this blood flowed in the Garden of Gethsemani, at the scourging,
at the crowning with thorns, and at the crucifixion! Precious blood of my
Jesus, I adore thee; pour thyself over my soul that I may be washed in the
blood of the Lamb.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


Unhappy mankind was bound in the slavery and tyranny of Satan, in the
shadow of death, without being able to free itself. Jesus, the Victor over
death and hell, came into the world to destroy the kingdom of the prince
of darkness, and to set the human race free, so that it might look up once
more to God the Father. This great work, so beneficial to our souls, was
effected by the shedding of the blood of Christ at the circumcision, and
the completion of the sacrifice when He shed the last drop of His blood on
the cross. In this sacred blood we have received the power to co-operate
with the graces of God, which are to free us; for certainly we must do
something on our part to keep this newly-acquired privilege of children of
God. Let us, then, feel in our hearts the necessity of a devotion to the
precious blood of Our Lord, the cause of our salvation; and continue
during this month of July to adore it, and to conceive an unbounded
confidence in the almighty power of its intercession.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood of Jesus in satisfaction
for my sins, and for the wants of holy Church. Blessed be the precious
blood of Jesus, which renders bearable the thorns of earth, redeems our
souls, purifies them from their iniquities, and prepares for them an
eternal crown. Amen.



Second Day.


When Constantine had become a Christian, he found himself confronted by
many enemies of his kingdom, and of our holy religion. He was told to have
confidence in the cross, because in this sign "Thou shalt conquer." We,
too, will conquer by this sacred symbol of our salvation, stained with the
blood of Our Lord; we, too, have the enemies of our liberty and religion
before us; we have to fight against the world, that is full of deceits and
vanities; we have to make war against the flesh, that rises frequently
against the spirit; we have to fight against the prince of darkness, that
goes about like a roaring lion seeking to tear us to pieces. Yes, my dear
Jesus, I see that my enemies have great power and activity; give me also
the power and activity to oppose my will and intellect against them, so
that I may conquer. Thou didst come upon the earth for the purpose of
giving me this victory; let me not be conquered and led back into slavery.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Third Day.


We come to understand the value of our soul from the price which was paid
for its ransom. When you wish to purchase a precious gem, you judge of its
value from its cost. We must judge of the value of our souls, then, by the
same standard. It cost the precious blood of Jesus Christ to purchase our
souls. Christ would have given it for the possession of only one soul; for
even one soul is the likeness of God. The price that is asked for its
possession is nothing less than the life and blood of a God-man. Think,
then, seriously, that all the goods of the world, its riches, honors, and
comforts, are not precious enough to buy your soul; that if you gain these
things by the loss of your soul you have gained nothing; that you have
been deceived and cheated, and that you got the worst of the bargain. "For
what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world and to lose his own
soul?" You are sprinkled with the blood of the Lamb of God. Even one drop
of this blood would be sufficient to redeem mankind, it is so precious in
the sight of God the Father, to Whom it is offered.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


O my soul, where will the thorns, the nails, the cross, the death and
blood of your own martyrdom be, when you are asked how you co-operated
with the saving power of the blood of Christ? when you have to show what
you have done on your part? Jesus suffered so much for us, and we do
nothing for His love. Are you going to heaven without prayer, without
mortification of the flesh and your passions, without the practise of
virtue? The salvation of Christ, instead of being a help to you, will
become the source of your damnation. The Israelites, crossing the dried
bed of the Red Sea in their flight from the Egyptians, found their
liberation, while the Egyptians met with their destruction. So also we
shall be happily found and brought to heaven if we apply to our souls the
blood of Christ, while we will find ourselves condemned to eternal
perdition if we abuse that adorable gift. O my Jesus, let me appreciate
the great gift of Thy precious blood.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


Since Almighty God has done so much for us through the sufferings of His
divine Son, what are our obligations for all that Christ endured? We
should think very much during this month on the great mercy of God. We
have already meditated on the Passion of Christ during Lent, and on other
occasions have thought of the shedding of the blood of Christ; but this
month, especially, we will try to make a particular devotion of our dear
Lord's precious blood, and engrave holy sentiments regarding it deeply on
our souls. In everything that concerns the spiritual life we feel the
power of the blood of Christ; and when we are thoroughly imbued with the
importance of the precious value of the sacred blood, and how great were
the sufferings of Our Lord, we will begin to have an idea of how
stupendous an undertaking our redemption was. Our Lord will visit with
special blessings those who love and honor His sacred blood. You will feel
a new life from this sacred blood coursing through your veins, and
circulating in your heart and brain. It will give a life of spiritual
energy.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Sixth Day.


We ought to imitate the virtues of the Heart of Jesus, from which His
sacred blood flowed; and this imitation will produce in us a perfect
purity. For what purpose has the sacred blood been offered but to cleanse
us from sin and to bring us back to the love of God? It preserves purity
in our soul, because it gives us the grace of loving God, and gives us
strength to say, "I feel within me the energy of the divine blood; and I
am ready to make every sacrifice with joy, in return for the one perfect
and all-sufficient sacrifice which has been made for me." The nearer we
are to the Sacred Heart, and to the influences of the sacred blood of
Christ, the fountain of all grace, the more holy we become. Let us then
love the virtues which shine so conspicuously in the Heart of Jesus. Let
us be generous with God and gentle and indulgent with others, as a
reflection of the charity of the Heart of Jesus.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


The precious blood obtains the forgiveness of our sins. Then with what
great eagerness should we seek for this pardon! In what an unhappy state
is our soul when stained by sin! By sin death came into the world and into
our heart. We were robbed of the grace of God, lost His friendship, and
came under the dominion of Satan, which is worse than death, and of which
it is true that "it were better we had not been born." In all this wreck
and misfortune there is but one object to which we can turn, and that is
the sacred blood of Christ as it flows from His wounds, and which He
offers to the Almighty to condone for our faults, and to restore us to the
grace of God. We do not get immunity from corporal death, which they say
mankind would have enjoyed had it not fallen by the sin of our first
parents. We are still afflicted by frailty, ignorance, and the inordinate
demands of passion; but we have received the greatest gift, which cannot
be surpassed by any other: the gift of the sacred blood of Christ.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Eighth Day.


The only thing that is asked of us is a horror of sin. We renounced Satan,
sin, and hell at our baptism, but we are only too apt to forget the
promises made then. During this month we will recall to ourselves our
duty, and impress it deeply upon our souls; we will avoid sin and look
upon it with horror, for it is a most loathsome object, hateful to God,
and consequently it ought to be hateful to us. Sin was punished in the
angels, in Adam, and even in ourselves; we must convince ourselves of this
truth. St. Paul says, "Jesus has redeemed us with His blood," and for the
destruction of sin has given inexhaustible treasures of grace. O my dear
Jesus, when I remember my sins, I would wish to have the courage to ask
Thee that I might die at Thy feet in punishment for them; but at least
make me really understand that I belong to God, to the angels, that I have
renounced Satan, his demons and darkness, and that I must remain faithful
to the part I have chosen.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Ninth Day.


If we trust in the efficacy of the precious blood, we are sure to remain
in the state of redemption, even though severe temptations assail us. The
devil will surely attack us; but let us not be dismayed, because we are
fortified with supernatural strength by the merits of the blood of Jesus.
These temptations will even be a source of glory to us, for St. James
says, "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been
proved, he shall receive the crown of life."--Jas. i. 12. The devil
trembles before a soul that is protected by Christ; he flies because he
knows that there he will find no human weakness. Remember the Jewish
Passover, which was instituted in commemoration of the plague in Egypt:
every first-born son was to die on that night, unless the blood of the
Lamb was sprinkled on the door-posts; so also will the devil pass the
house of our soul, when he finds the blood of the Lamb of God used as a
protection. Yes, my dear Jesus, I know that when I am washed in Thy divine
blood in the Sacrament of Penance, or when strengthened by the drinking of
Thy blood in holy communion, the tempter flies from me because he knows he
will be defeated.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Tenth Day.


Sin brings great sorrow and misfortune to a soul. As sin brought all
trouble into the world, so it repeats itself in our souls. Have we not
heard of the wages of sin? No sooner have we revolted against the law of
God than all the unruly passions of our souls are let loose. Incessant
demands are made on our ingenuity to seek for occasions of gratifying our
appetites; ambition, vanity, and pride spur us on to every excess. You can
well imagine that in such a soul there is no peace nor happiness. God
rises in anger against the sinner, the world even strikes us down; we have
the sign of Cain on our forehead, and all nature is at enmity with us.
Where can you find peace for your soul but in Jesus, the Prince of
peace?--Who takes us up and leads us to God, where the past is forgotten
and innocence reigns once more in our hearts. Let us preserve this peace
by a virtuous life, and by observing the Commandments of God. Let us also
keep peace with our neighbor; let us love him because he is our brother,
redeemed by the precious blood of Christ.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Eleventh Day.


If our heart is to preserve the true, interior peace of God, we must
approach the Lord Jesus with the cross, and with the blood that falls on
us beneath the cross we must wash away the stains of sin. St. Francisca of
Rome had a vision in which she saw many chains issuing from the wounds of
Our Lord's sacred body, and these went out to a multitude of souls and
bound them to the Redeemer. She understood that in this attachment was the
peace, the happiness, and the victory of many who otherwise would have
perished. Let us look for the particular chain intended for us, as we can
thereby bind ourselves to the contemplation of the Passion, in which we
shall find peace and comfort as long as we remain faithful. Heavenly
Father, I offer to Thee, for Thy glory and my salvation, the blood of
Jesus; let me appreciate its value in its fulness. Thou, my Jesus, seest
the many dangers by which I am surrounded, and as Thou didst at one time
command the winds to cease and the waves of the stormy sea to be calm, so
watch over me that I may find peace in Thy service and be attached to Thee
out of love for that peace which Thou alone canst give.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twelfth Day.


Our Lord had a great desire to gain our souls. He made it easy for us to
approach His sacred wounds, from whence the blood flowed. He instituted
the Blessed Sacrament for our nourishment; speaking of this sacred blood,
He said: "Drink ye all of this; this is My blood; and if any thirst let
him come to Me and I will give him to drink." The sacraments are nothing
but channels by which the blood of Christ is conveyed to our souls. It was
the Passion and sufferings of Christ that gave the sacraments their
efficacy. The water of Baptism becomes, as it were, the blood of Christ;
the penitential accusation is carried to the presence of the Lord Himself,
and by the mouth of the priest He speaks the absolution; the blood of
Christ is in reality in the Holy Eucharist. Confirmation makes us strong
Christians, because the blood of Christ is there, and the Spirit of God
comes to complete the work of Jesus. What is Extreme Unction but the
application of the blood of Christ to the sick, that they may become
strong?

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Thirteenth Day.


St. Bernard says of the blood of Christ: "that it is like a trumpet that
calls for mercy; it is a voice that speaks more strongly than Abel's, not
for vengeance but for forgiveness. This blood binds the hands of God's
justice." We may then hope that the voice of this adorable blood will be
raised in our behalf, as it was used to promise the penitent thief eternal
happiness. It was with sincere love that Jesus Christ cried to the
heavenly Father for us. He came to this world that His blood might always
call to God for mercy. His blood was spilled over the surface of the
earth, that all mankind might drink of its benefits. Satiated by the
precious blood we will really hate sin, we will triumph over our evil
passions, we will substitute virtues in their stead. Jesus is the fountain
of all graces; it is He that takes such a great interest in us that
whatever we do in His name will add to our glory, so that though we may
have been poor and despised creatures, by the blood of Christ we have been
ennobled and made heirs of the kingdom of God.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Fourteenth Day.


When Our Lord died on the cross one of the soldiers pierced His side, to
make sure that He was dead. It was a real death, for we know that blood
and water poured from that wound. Here we see the water of Baptism applied
to our souls; in Baptism we are born again, we become children of God, our
sins are forgiven and we have a right to the reward of heaven. We are no
longer outcasts, nor an accursed race; we have become children of God. And
why? Because we have become the brothers of Jesus Christ, Who is a child
of God, the Son of God; it was this Child that made us children too,
because from His sacred side on the cross He poured out water and blood
over the human race; the curse was taken away from the race of mankind,
and they may now go to heaven if they will. But have we preserved this
life of grace, this new life of a supernatural order? No, indeed. There is
not a human creature on the earth that has been cleansed by the blood of
Christ, but has fallen back, and rebelled against God.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Fifteenth Day.


Man's life is a struggle for good from the beginning to the end. We are
taken out of wickedness by Baptism, and we are frequently redeemed by
penance. We need a sacrament that will give us perseverance. "Be thou
faithful unto death," is the watchword that St. John cries out to the
bishop in the Apocalypse, "and I will give thee the crown of life." We are
never sure of ourselves; even the sharpest intellect will not be able to
say whether he be worthy of God's wrath or of God's love. Therefore Jesus
Christ has applied the merits of His sacred blood to the Sacrament of
Confirmation, by which we are to be made strong, by which human weakness
is to be taken away. After receiving this sacrament what noble works we
are capable of! In the olden ages martyrs died for Christ; mothers saw
their children martyred before their eyes, all for the love of Jesus,
strengthened by this sacrament. People give up the world and persevere in
the heroic practice of virtue by the grace of the precious blood of Jesus.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Sixteenth Day.


How comes it that although we are endowed with virtue from on high,
nevertheless we sometimes make the blood of Christ of no avail to us? By
Confirmation we ought to be perfect Christians, and still we are far from
being such. The reason of our weakness, is that we are addicted to the
things of this world, and we are very much inclined to follow the demands
of our passions. We do not place implicit confidence in the efficacy of
the precious blood; we do not desire to be cured of our maladies; we do
not pray to be freed from our evil inclinations. What great strength did
not the saints gather from the precious blood! How strong they were
against the devil! How mortified their lives! How sincere in the service
of God--and all through the power of that sacred blood. How firm the
martyrs stood in their testimony for the faith! how many Christians
persevere in doing good by means of the graces derived from the adoration
of the precious blood! If we would be as they were, we must turn to the
suffering Jesus, and adjure Him, by the blood that He shed, to sustain us
also in our struggle against the foes of our salvation.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Seventeenth Day.


In nothing is the beauty of the Church more noticeable than in her love of
devotions. The devotion to the precious blood becomes manifest on many
occasions. She has established the feast of the precious blood, and others
more or less intimately united to this sacred practice of piety. Full of
divine instincts, her worship grows with all the exuberance of a tropical
plant, covering herself with verdure and blossom; she makes devotions of
joys and of sorrows; none of the old blossoms fall off--on the contrary new
varieties make their appearance. The Church is more beautiful now than she
was three centuries ago, and three centuries from the present time new
glories will have developed themselves. Every century has given rise to
new devotions, according to the needs of the Church. Sometimes a holy man
looks at the incarnation in a new light, and a new devotion springs up.
The devotion of the Holy Childhood has developed itself into devotion to
the Infant of Prague, or has taken a more practical turn in the society of
the Holy Childhood for the redemption of heathen children.

Who were the great worshippers of the precious blood? St. Paul wrote in
his epistles most beautifully of the precious blood, and he may be said to
be the author of this devotion. It was in this devotion that the power of
his apostolate consisted. St. Chrysostom, the great preacher of the East,
spoke most touchingly of the precious blood, and of the sufferings of Our
Lord. St. Augustine, after his conversion, attributed all his improvement
in the supernatural life to the love that Jesus bore him. St. Gertrude's
writings are full of the most beautiful sentiments concerning the precious
blood. In modern times, St. Catharine of Sienna, the prophetess of the
precious blood, singled out this devotion with a special love, with
reference to the needs of her time, to which, in her judgment, sufficient
importance had not been given. We read of Frances of the Mother of God, a
Carmelite, that these words of the Apocalypse were deeply imprinted in her
mind: "He hath loved us, and washed away our sins in His blood." Our Lord
said to her interiorly, "I have shed My blood for your sins, and now I
come in holy communion to wash away the stains which remain." When she had
received Our Lord she saw her soul all covered with blood.

Nineteenth Day.


In the life of the Venerable Ann of Jesus, a companion of St. Teresa, we
read that at communion her mouth was sensibly filled with very sweet
blood, which flowed from the Host. St. Clare of Rimini's holy and
mysterious thirst was appeased only by the blood in the Host. Marcella
Benci used to serve St. Philip of Neri's Mass, and frequently saw the
chalice full of blood. Margaret Beanne the Carmelite saw habitually the
blood of Jesus in the souls of men; they were so beautified by it that she
could not bear to hear any one censured because of the reverence she felt
even for the souls of the wicked, for she saw them covered with the blood
of Jesus. Sister Benedict of Egersheim after communion used to feel
sensibly Our Lord's blood flowing as a torrent down into the abyss of her
soul, and burning away all the remnants of sin, leaving her a most pure
vessel of sanctity. Such are some of the examples of the thoughts and
experience of the saints in communing with the precious blood, which made
them what they were, friends of God and intimate with Jesus Christ, the
Spouse of their souls.

There is no surer sign of the growth of a special devotion than when the
Church erects a confraternity in its honor. These confraternities keep the
devotion alive, direct it, and embody all its practices. There is the
archconfraternity of the Precious Blood in Rome, and this confraternity
forms the keystone of all the confraternities throughout the world. Popes
have enriched it with many indulgences, and have given to the Passionists
and to the missionaries of the precious blood special blessings. Among the
people of Spain we notice particularly the rise and continuance of
societies devoted to the honoring of the precious blood. Leo XIII.
enriched the societies with many indulgences. Pope Pius IX., of glorious
memory, authorized the wearing of the red scapular. When he returned from
exile he instituted a new feast distinct from the one celebrated in Lent.
So many favors have been granted to it that we receive the impression that
it is the special devotion of the Holy See.

The devotion to the precious blood is especially opportune for our
days--these days of infidelity and of atheism. It shows that the redemption
is due to the efficacy of the precious blood. It throws out into strong
light the most intimate relation of the incarnation; it meets the false
spirituality which we conceive of the sacred humanity of Christ. It is a
revelation of the character of God, as well as of the work of Jesus; it
brings into our heart the love of the kingdom of God, and thus we begin
again to have faith, the right faith as it is given us by the Church. We
are aroused to the love of Jesus, and feel sensibly that He is still in
the Church, and that His sacred blood is even now performing wonders. O my
soul, what unthought-of greatness is in the precious blood of Jesus! how
charming is the devotion, and how many souls labor under its benign
influence! Let me, O my sweet Jesus, reverence that precious blood, and
apply it to my soul for an increase of faith in God and His revelations,
in hope for a happy future, and in love for Christ crucified.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twenty-second Day.


The devotion of the precious blood very materially supports the devotion
to the Passion of Our Lord. It furnishes a point of view from which we may
regard each separate suffering, each separate wound, and mould it into one
universal consideration. It is thus a unity of the devotion to the
Passion, as well as a variety of it, besides being in itself an additional
devotion. The precious blood brings vividness to the meditation on the
Passion. There is no greater devotion than meditation on the Passion; the
saints have always made it the help and consolation of their progress.
What is consideration of the precious blood but a contemplation of the
Passion under another aspect? We bring the entire Passion under the head
of one mystery, and still we preserve all the details, so that the Passion
and the precious blood are the favorite contemplations of all devout
Christians. O dear Jesus crucified, make me love the cross; make me desire
to stand beneath the cross, in order to receive on my soul one drop of
that precious blood which is being poured out for my redemption.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twenty-third Day.


The closest alliance, however, is between the precious blood and the
Sacred Heart. The Heart of Jesus is the centre of our affection; it is the
source from which the blood of Christ is drawn, the wealth of the Sacred
Heart. It is the blood that warms that Heart and makes it beat for our
sakes, so that every pulsation is an act of love for the human race. The
Heart of Jesus teaches us to hate sin; the precious blood so copiously
shed for our redemption inculcates the hatred of sin. We hate sin purely,
manfully, and strongly; we do penance, we mortify ourselves, we mourn over
our sins and the sins of others. All this is taught by the sacred blood of
Our Lord; it is surely a valuable lesson which we ought to learn, since
the instruction is given in so forcible a manner, and is so frequently
inculcated.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twenty-fourth Day.


There is a virtue which, in the language of the theologians of the Church,
is called the angelic virtue: a virtue most pleasing to God. It is
chastity. The precious blood makes us chaste according to our state of
life; it makes those pure and virginal who practise this devotion and
gives them the grace to preserve purity and to persevere in it. This
virtue renders us very pleasing to almighty God, Who loves pure souls.
"Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God," and chastity is
an expression of the purity of the soul. The devil makes the greatest
efforts to deprive us of this great treasure. The greatest and most
frequent temptation which we have to endure is certainly that against
purity. Our body seems to be full of impurity, our imaginations crowded
with thoughts of a defiling character. The virtue of purity endears us to
Mary, the purest of virgins; she loves those whom God regards with special
favor, and to whom He has promised the particular privilege of
contemplating Him for all eternity.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twenty-fifth Day.


How beautiful a virtue is true humility! We love and admire it in others,
but we ourselves are far from possessing it. Humility is the foundation on
which all other virtues are built. Pride is a most hateful vice in the
sight of God, for He would rather receive a humble sinner than a saint
inclined to pride. God resists the proud, and gives His grace to the
humble. The devotion of the precious blood will secure humility. Jesus
shed His blood amid the greatest humiliations. In the Garden of Olives,
bowed to the earth, He poured forth His blood in an agony of shame and
horror over the sins of men; He was beaten like a slave in the court of
Pilate; the blood poured from His face, wounded by blows and defiled by
spittle, and from His head crowned with thorns. It stained the streets of
Jerusalem on His way to Calvary; it flowed to the foot of the cross, as He
hung and died between two malefactors, where He was considered the most
abject of men. Let us learn the lesson of humility from the death of
Christ.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twenty-sixth Day.


Zeal for souls, zeal for the glory of God, was the motive that induced the
Son of God to come down from heaven to suffer and die on the cross. Might
not we, also, do something for the glory of God and the good of souls, if
we had a little zeal towards that end? The apostles learned zeal from the
Passion of Our Lord. When the Lord had died on the cross, they became
inflamed with zeal and worked in an apostolic manner that souls might be
brought to the kingdom of God; suffering became precious in their sight,
because they endured it for the good of humanity. We that profess the love
of the precious blood must also have zeal for the salvation of souls. What
can we do? We can pray; we can offer up our petitions incessantly for some
particular individual until we are heard; we can surround people by such
influences that their minds will be changed and brought back to God. But
frequently we are inactive and inattentive to these means which God has
given us; we are not filled with zeal for furthering the devotion to
Christ's precious blood, and for the salvation of souls.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twenty-seventh Day.


As we may do much good by a prudent zeal for the living, we can still more
benefit the souls in purgatory by the application of the merits of the
precious blood. Those souls are already in the hands of God, undergoing a
purification to fit them to enter heaven. They can do nothing for
themselves; they must patiently endure the just punishment that is meted
out to them. But the Church teaches us that we can help them, and we are
encouraged to use the means which God has placed in our hands. Those who
are in purgatory will surely go to heaven, but we can shorten their
purification by prayer. Our supplications for the souls in purgatory may
be even more productive of good than praying for the living, for these may
resist the goodness of God and render themselves unworthy of further
graces, while the souls in purgatory, being the friends of God, will
readily receive the benefit of our prayers. Purgatory is an effect of sin,
and sin and its effects are effaced by the blood of Christ. The Apostle
has said that Jesus loved us, and has given His blood to wash us.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twenty-eighth Day.


The sacred wounds of Our Lord are those abundant springs from which flow
the kindness and charity of God. Many saints have had revelations and
visions of this in their ecstatic prayers. St. Gertrude saw streams of
blood issuing from the wounds of Our Lord and flowing like rivers through
the Church, rendering her fruitful in many heroic virtues. How can we have
any merit unless we receive it from Our Lord? for without Him we can do
nothing. To do something meritorious, then, we should have recourse to Our
Lord in prayer. Our prayers would fall to the ground and be without
result, unless helped by the pleading of the precious blood; our works of
mortification would be useless, our penance vain attempts for forgiveness,
unless the precious blood made them efficacious. As the sun gives light to
the world, enlightening and fructifying it, so the precious blood shines
on our actions and makes them glow with a supernatural merit. There are
some virtues which we may practise to a certain degree, but how imperfect
are the best intentions, without God's love as a motive.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Twenty-ninth Day.


Remember that perseverance is the great grace which we are all striving
for. It is not a grace that we can merit at any one time, for it is only a
continuation of fidelity. It is a very important grace; what does it
profit to have gained all possible graces, and to be filled with
consolation, when in the end we shall not be counted among the elect of
God? He is, of course, interested in your eternal salvation--in other
words, your final perseverance. But we are living in a state of probation
here; it is not possible, except in some special case of extraordinary
grace, that we could be possibly in any other state than doubt as regards
the future. It is natural for those who are on trial to fear that they
will not succeed; there are so many a great deal better than we are that
when we compare their excellence with our weak efforts to do right, we
feel so inferior that we are afraid of being rejected. Hence it is that we
are told to work out our salvation with fear and trembling, lest we may
not reach the end for which we have been created.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.



Thirtieth Day.


Final perseverance can be obtained only through our humble faithfulness to
God and continued prayers. When we pray to the Lord, and beg of Him by His
precious blood to give us the grace of perseverance, or when we go to God
the Father, and offer Him the sacred blood of Jesus as a sacrifice, that
He may give us extraordinary grace to enable us to continue in His
service, He is not obliged to give it, but He will, just as a friend who
wishes to keep you attached to him gives you many presents and favors. We
must also turn to Mary in this doubtful struggle for eternal happiness.
Mary, the Mother of Jesus, has much to do with our salvation; we should
not despise her help. She supplied, as you may say, the precious blood to
Our Lord, by feeding Him with the milk of her breast. Or, as St. Bernard
tells us, mixing the milk of the Mother with the blood of the Son, in
order to prepare for us a most delicious drink. Mary ceases not to work in
heaven for the salvation of souls and for the conversion of poor sinners.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.

St. Alphonsus, in speaking of the precious blood, says: "So, then, my
Jesus, in order to save my soul, Thou hast prepared a bath of Thine own
blood wherein to cleanse it from the filth of its sins. If. then, our
souls have been bought by Thy blood, 'For you are bought with a great
price' (1 Cor. vi. 20), it is a sign that Thou lovest them much; and as
Thou dost love them, let us pray thus to Thee: 'We therefore pray Thee to
help Thy servants, whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious blood.' It is
true that by my sins I have separated myself from Thee, and have knowingly
lost Thee. But remember, my Jesus, that Thou hast bought me with Thy
blood. Ah, may this blood not have been given in vain for me, which was
shed with so much grief and so much love." We ought to read these words
over and over again, until they penetrate our souls with that devotion to
the precious blood which this great saint possessed, filling all our daily
lives with a heavenly sweetness.

Prayer.

Eternal Father, I offer Thee the precious blood, etc., etc.




Mass in Honor of the Precious Blood.


Introit.


    When the priest goes up to the altar to say Mass, think that the
    Lord is about to celebrate the Last Supper, during which He
    instituted the Holy Eucharist, and gave His flesh as food, and His
    blood as drink, to all the disciples present.


With a confident heart I am about to hear this holy Mass, to offer this
holy sacrifice with the priest. I offer it to the Blessed Trinity, as the
greatest means to obtain spiritual benefits for myself and those for whom
I intend to pray, that we all may receive what is most needful for our
body, but especially for our soul. Amen.

Confiteor.

I know, O my God, that I am unworthy to be admitted so closely to the Holy
of holies, or to be here during the celebration of the sacred mysteries: I
am unworthy on account of my many sins. O my God, I beg pardon for them,
and I am sure that I will receive forgiveness. I resolve to live a good
life so that, purified, I may look up to the sacred mountain, where
resides the God Who renews my youth. Yes, I have sinned against Thee, and
against heaven. I am not worthy to be called Thy child. Amen.

Kyrie.


    When the priest goes up to the altar and kisses it, remember the
    infamous kiss of Judas, think of your own infidelities, and cry
    out nine times with the priest: Lord, have mercy on us, Christ,
    have mercy on us. With your whole heart and soul join the choirs
    of angels in singing a hymn of praise to the Almighty, for all the
    mercies He has shown us by the sufferings and death of His divine
    Son. Offer up these sufferings for the benefit of the Church, for
    peace and harmony among nations, that the world may by the death
    of Christ enjoy a peace that will conduce to the acknowledgment of
    God's dominion over all mankind, that it may enjoy the benefit of
    the incarnation and death of the Lord.


Offertory.

I offer to Thee, O my God, with the priest, the bread and wine as did Our
Lord, Who wished us to do it in commemoration of Him. I offer to Thee the
pains which He endured at the bitter crowning, when the thorns were
pressed deep into His sacred head, and the precious blood flowed from the
wounds thus made, covering His whole face and disfiguring it so that it no
longer resembled a human countenance. I offer to Thee those sighs and
secret prayers which He offered, to atone for my wilful distractions in
prayer, my waywardness in thought, my unbridled imagination, for my pride
and disobedience, for all my errors, and for the errors of heretics and
schismatics, that Thou mayest send them the grace of conversion. Amen.

Gospel.

Remember, O God, the sufferings of the Lord when He was dragged before
Caiphas and Pontius Pilate. I offer myself to the guidance of Thy
providence; do with me what Thou wilt for Thy glory. May Thy holy Gospel
be always a consolation to me in all my troubles, and a guide to my
conduct, so that, leading a good Christian life during the remainder of my
stay in this world, I may direct my steps to heaven. Amen.

Credo.

I believe in the teachings of the Church; with a full acceptance I have
accepted Christianity, let me remain faithful to it under all
circumstances. Come to the assistance of my unbelief, that I may firmly
profess my faith openly before the world. I believe, especially, in the
efficacy of the Passion and the glory of the cross, a humiliation to the
people of the world, but a source of comfort and salvation to me. I
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Who taught me the articles of the
creed. I believe in the Church which He has established. I believe in the
forgiveness of my sins through the merits of the Passion and blood of the
Lord. Amen.

Lavabo.

Remember, O God, for my sake, the washing of the hands of Pilate, as a
sign of the innocence of the Lamb of God and His freedom from sin. Pilate
washed his hands as a sign that he was not guilty of the murder of Christ,
but I must acknowledge that I have condemned Jesus to death by my
sinfulness. My declaration of justice will not suffice, but do Thou
declare me pardoned. O my God, let me hear the words, "Thy sins are
forgiven thee." Amen.

Orate Fratres.

I call to mind the scene when Pilate presented Jesus to the Jewish rabble,
all covered with blood, with a crown of thorns on His head, His sacred
body torn with the lashes of the scourging, and enveloped in a purple
mantle. Pilate says, "Behold the man!" But the Jews cry out, and oh, how
their cruel words sound in my ears, "Crucify Him, crucify Him"! Look upon
our Jesus, O God, as He stands there, claiming the kindness of some good
heart, and through His precious blood have mercy on us. Amen.

Canon.

I will now, O my God, with the angels, bow low before Thee, and cry Holy,
holy, holy, God of hosts! The angels continually cry thus to Thee in
heaven. I ought to be engaged here on earth in the same occupation. But
let me continue to meditate on the sacred Passion of Thy Son and how He
carried His cross. I offer Thee the way of the cross which He made, and
all the suffering which He endured during it. He fell three times to the
ground, crushed by its weight; stains of blood from His recent scourging
marked His path. I see the Cyrenean unwilling to carry the cross for
Jesus. Veronica wipes His face, and the women of Jerusalem weep over the
cruelty that the Lord had to endure. I offer to Thee the bitter meeting of
Mary and her beloved Son. May I be encouraged, through Christ's Passion,
to take the cross on my own shoulders, and carry it with joy. I offer Thee
the painful carrying of the cross for all poor Christians who have heavy
crosses to bear, and who are bearing them patiently; for the sick, the
dying, the poor orphan child, the patient mother who labors, with
resignation to Thy holy will, for those dependent on her, and for all who
have to suffer on this earth. Let me understand, O my Jesus, the valuable
lesson that I deserve to suffer on account of my many sins. Amen.

Elevation Of The Host And Chalice.

I believe, my Jesus, that Thou art now present on this altar; that this
bread is now Thy body, and this wine is now Thy blood. Now, O my God, Thy
beloved Son has arrived at Calvary. His garments are torn off, and He is
nailed to the cross. He is raised, and suspended between heaven and earth,
with hands and arms outstretched. There He hangs for three hours, and
makes the sacrifice of Himself to Thee, His heavenly Father, for the
salvation of the human race. O heavenly Father, look down on this altar
and hear the sighs of Thy pleading Son! This is the same sacrifice as that
on Calvary: let this Mass, then, have a great spiritual benefit to all on
earth. This precious blood is offered up every day on our altars, to
obtain pardon for our sins, and new graces for the future. Amen.

Agnus Dei.

I now contemplate Jesus hanging on the cross, His blood flowing from His
wounds. I adore Thee on the cross, I listen to Thy words as Thou dost pray
for sinners. This holy sacrifice is for them: Christ is the willing Victim
that is expiating the sins of mankind; He thirsts for souls on the cross.
Father Creator, why dost Thou not create new creatures, and satisfy the
thirst of Thy divine Son? Thou canst force the wicked to a change of
heart, as Thou didst St. Paul. "Create a clean heart in me, O my God." But
to bring the sacrifice to completion, after the three hours of agony the
voice of Jesus is heard exclaiming, "It is consummated." All is completed;
the sufferings and humiliation of the cross are over. Amen.

Communion.

Would, O my Jesus, that I were in a state to go and unite myself to Thee!
At least I will unite myself in a spiritual manner. I should always be so
full of love towards Thee as to think ever of Thee, and desire to be
closely united to Thee and to have Thee buried in my heart. Let me
consider before Thee, O heavenly Father, that the sacrifice of the cross
is completed, that Thou hast accepted it, and dost look upon the earth
with pity and mercy. Still the cruelty of the Jews is not satisfied. They
have one more wound to inflict on the Lord. A soldier with a lance opens
the sacred side of Our Lord, to demonstrate to every one that the Victim
is really dead. O my God, I offer Thee these last marks of the love of the
dead Jesus, the wound in His sacred side, and the drops of blood and water
which issue therefrom. O my Jesus, Thy heart is open for my reception. I
will take refuge therein, away from the temptations of the world. Give me
the grace not to fall into mortal sin, as well as to persevere in my
resolution to avoid even small sins to the end of my life. I pray for the
poor souls in purgatory, for my parents, relatives, sisters and brothers.
I recommend to the goodness of Thy Sacred Heart all my benefactors, all
those who need my prayers, all the poor, the miserable, and the wretched.
I pray also for my country; for peace, prosperity, and love among all the
nations that have gathered here to make this their fatherland. I pray also
for the conversion of all to the faith, that this may be the kingdom of
God here on earth, one sheepfold of Christ, the Good Shepherd. I offer to
Thee, O my God, all the sufferings of Jesus for these necessities. Amen.

Conclusion Of The Mass.

In order that this day may be most profitable to me, and to those for whom
I have offered this Mass, O heavenly Father, I join myself in spirit in
all the Masses that are continually being said all over the world. What
great graces are given to mankind by this unceasing succession of
oblations of the precious body and blood of Christ! I offer to Thee, also,
O my Saviour, all the pious works which are done by so many faithful
Christians all over the world. I offer all the confessions, communions,
rosaries, and all prayers, as well as all good works of fasting,
almsgiving, and penances which are done. I wish to gain all the
indulgences which are within my reach to-day, that I may apply them to the
souls in purgatory. Now that the priest is about to bless the people in
Thy name, do Thou bless me, as well as those for whom I have prayed. Pour
out, by the hands of the priest, the blessing of Thy precious blood with
all its merit and innumerable graces, on the souls in purgatory. Purify us
from our sins by means of this blessing, and give us strength and courage
to do good works. Protect us, Thy children and the heirs of Thy kingdom,
and lead us to eternal happiness in company with all the saints in heaven.
Amen.

Thanksgiving After Mass.

I thank Thee, O my God, at the end of this Mass, for all the graces which
I have received during it. The grace of attention to this holy sacrifice,
the grace of faith by which I really saw the dying Jesus offered to God
the Father, and His sacred blood applied to the wounds of my soul. I thank
Thee for that love which has made me come here, and spend some time in the
service of God. May I preserve, to the end of my life, the graces which I
have received, so that they may bring me to heaven. The love of God
almighty, the grace of His divine Son, and the imparting of the Holy
Ghost, be always with me and all the faithful throughout the world. The
power of the precious blood, the treasure of the merits of the Blessed
Virgin, and the intercession of all the saints accompany me now to my
home, to my daily work, and make all that I say and do faithful to eternal
life. Amen.

Daily Offering.


O my Lord and my God! I commend myself to Thy adorable Heart, and in Thy
sacred wounds I resign myself to Thy holy will this day and forever.
Include me, O my Lord and my God, in all the holy Masses that have been or
will be offered up this day in the whole world. O Lord, I desire to share
in all holy communions, all holy Benedictions, in all indulgences, in all
the merits and prayers of devout hearts now and forever. O my Lord and my
God! I offer Thee all my steps, all my weariness and labors, all my cares
and antipathies, all my crosses, sufferings, ignominies, injuries,
persecutions, and adversities; these I offer Thee in honor of Thy holy
humanity and of Thy most bitter Passion and death; in the merits of all
these I include (_here mention the names of those for whom you wish to
pray in particular_), all my relatives, benefactors, friends, enemies, the
sick and dying, those who are in temptation or oppressed; all that have
commended themselves to my prayers, or for whom I have promised to pray;
those to whom I have given scandal, or whom I have in any way enticed to
sin; my parents, sisters, and brothers, who have departed this life, and
all the souls of the faithful departed. My crucified Saviour, have mercy
on the most suffering and abandoned souls in purgatory, also on me, a poor
sinner; give me the grace I daily need to serve Thee faithfully until
death. I return Thee thanks, thousands and millions of thanks, for all the
favors and benefits which Thou hast heaped on me from the first moment of
my existence to the present hour. I pray Thee to preserve me always in Thy
holy grace, particularly at the hour of my death. Amen.

Indulgences for all the Faithful, even Such as are not Members.


    For such as shall recite the Chaplet of the Precious Blood once in
    the day, seven years and as many quarantines; and if they recite
    it daily for a month, a plenary indulgence, having confessed and
    communicated, on the last day of the month, or any day in the
    following month. (Pius VII., Oct. 18, 1815.)

    The same indulgence can be gained by the recital of thirty-three
    Our Fathers, meditating at the same time on the seven times Our
    Lord shed His precious blood; or, by such as are uninstructed and
    incompetent to meditate, by the simple recital of the thirty-three
    Our Fathers. (Gregory XVI., July 5, 1843.)

    For the prayer, "O most precious blood, etc.," placed at the end
    of the Chaplet, three hundred days' indulgence, once a day.




Chaplet of the Precious Blood.


    This chaplet is composed of seven mysteries, in which we meditate
    upon the seven times in which Jesus Christ for love of us shed
    blood from His most innocent body; at each mystery, except the
    last, we are to say five Our Fathers and one Glory be to the
    Father, thus making up the number of thirty-three Our Fathers in
    remembrance of the thirty-three years during which the precious
    blood of Jesus flowed in His veins, before it was all poured out
    for our salvation. The Chaplet ends with the devout prayer, "O
    most precious blood, etc."


The Chaplet.

_V._ Incline unto my aid, O God.

_R._ O Lord, make haste to help me.

_V._ Glory be to the Father, etc.

_R._ As it was, etc.

First Mystery.

The first time our loving Saviour shed His precious blood for us was on
the eighth day after His birth, when He was circumcised in order to
accomplish the Law of Moses. While, then, we reflect that Jesus did this
to satisfy the justice of God for our dissolute lives, let us excite
ourselves to true sorrow for them, and promise, with the help of His all-
powerful grace, to be henceforth truly chaste in body and in soul.

Five Our Fathers and one Glory.

We beseech Thee, therefore, help Thy servants whom Thou hast redeemed with
Thy precious blood.

Second Mystery.

Next in the Garden of Olives, Jesus shed His blood for us in such quantity
that it bathed the earth around. This took place at the sight of the
ingratitude with which men would meet His love. Oh, let us then repent
sincerely, because we have hitherto corresponded so illy with the
innumerable benefits of Our God, and resolve to make good use of His
graces and holy inspirations.

Five Our Fathers, etc.

We beseech, etc.

Third Mystery.

Next, in His cruel scourging, Jesus shed His blood, when His flesh was so
torn that rivers of blood flowed from His body in every part, all of which
He offered, all the time, to His eternal Father in payment of our
impatience and our delicacy. How is it, then, we do not curb our anger and
our self-love? Henceforth we will indeed try our very best to bear our
troubles well, and, despising ourselves, to take peacefully the injuries
which men may do us.

Five Our Fathers, etc.

We beseech, etc.

Fourth Mystery.

Again, from the sacred head of Jesus, blood poured down when it was
crowned with thorns, in punishment of our pride and evil thoughts. Shall
we, then, continue to nurture haughtiness, foster foul imaginations, and
feed the wayward will in our minds? Henceforth let there ever be before
our eyes our utter nothingness, our misery and our weakness; and with
generous hearts let us resist all the wicked suggestions of the devil.

Five Our Fathers, etc.

We beseech, etc.

Fifth Mystery.

How much of His precious blood did not our loving Lord pour forth from His
veins, when laden with the heavy wood of the cross on the mournful way to
Calvary, so that the streets and ways of Jerusalem through which He passed
were watered with it! This was done in satisfaction for the scandals and
the bad examples by which His own creatures had led others astray on the
way to ruin. Who can tell how many of us are of this unhappy number? Who
knows how many he himself alone has by his own bad example brought down to
hell? And have we done anything to remedy this evil? Let us henceforth, at
least, endeavor all we can to save souls by word and by example, making
ourselves a pattern to all of a good and holy life.

Five Our Fathers, etc.

We beseech, etc.

Sixth Mystery.

Still more copiously the Redeemer of mankind shed blood in His barbarous
crucifixion; when His veins being rent and arteries burst, there rushed
forth in a torrent from His hands and His feet that saving balm of life
eternal, to pay for all the crimes and enormities of the universe.
Whoever, after this, would continue in sin, and so renew the cruel
crucifixion of the Son of God? Let us weep bitterly for our bad deeds, and
let us detest them at the feet of the sacred minister of God; let us amend
our evil ways, and henceforth begin a truly Christian life, with the
thought ever in our hearts of all the blood which our eternal salvation
cost the Saviour of men.

Five Our Fathers, etc.

We beseech, etc.

Seventh Mystery.

Last of all, after His death, when His sacred side was opened, and His
loving Heart was wounded, Jesus shed blood, and with the blood there came
forth water, to show us how the blood was all poured out to the last drop
for our salvation. Oh, the infinite goodness of Our Redeemer! Who will not
love Thee, my Saviour? What heart will not consume itself away for love of
Thee, Who hast done all this for our redemption? The tongue wants words to
praise Thee; let us, then, invite all creatures upon earth, all angels and
all saints in paradise, and most of all, our dear Mother Mary, to bless,
to praise, and to celebrate Thy most precious blood. Glory to the blood of
Jesus! Glory to the blood of Jesus! now and ever throughout all ages.
Amen.


    At this last mystery three Our Fathers and one Glory be to the
    Father, etc., are said to make up the number of thirty-three.


We beseech, etc.

_Then the following_

Prayer.

O most precious blood of eternal life, the ransom and redemption of the
whole universe! the drink and bath of our souls, thou who art ever
pleading the cause of men before the throne of God's sovereign mercy! I
adore thee most profoundly, and desire, as far as it is in my power, to
compensate thee for the insults and affronts which thou art continually
receiving at the hands of men, especially of those who rashly dare to
blaspheme thee. And who is there that will not bless this blood of
infinite value? Who is there that will not feel himself inflamed with love
for Jesus, Who shed it? What should I be if I had not been redeemed by
this divine blood? What was it that drew thee forth from the veins of my
Lord, even to the last drop? Ah! it was naught else but love. O boundless
love, that has given us this balsam of salvation! O balsam beyond price,
streaming forth from the well-spring of a boundless love, grant, oh, grant
that every heart and tongue may praise, and magnify, and bless thee, now
and forever, even unto the day of eternity. Amen.

_V._ Thou hast redeemed us, O Lord, with Thy blood.

_R._ And Thou hast made us a kingdom unto Our God.

O almighty and eternal God, Who hast appointed Thy only-begotten Son to be
the Redeemer of the world, and hast willed to be appeased by His blood,
grant, we beseech Thee, that we may venerate upon earth the price of our
salvation, and be shielded by its might from the evils of this present
life, so that we may enjoy it everlastingly in heaven. Who liveth and
reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.
Amen.





AUGUST. THE HOLY GHOST.


We may during this month take up the devotion to the Holy Ghost.

This devotion to the Holy Spirit should be the chief of all devotions,
because it was the first that was ever celebrated, and that by no less
devout worshippers than the holy apostles and the most holy Mary in the
upper room at Jerusalem. It is one which is growing in the hearts of the
people, because so much depends for our sanctification on the influence of
the graces bestowed on us by God the Holy Ghost. Faith teaches us that the
Holy Ghost is the love which the Father and the Son bear one to the other;
and therefore the gift of love which the Lord infuses into our souls, and
which is the greatest of all gifts, is attributed to the Holy Ghost. St.
Paul says, "The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy
Ghost, Who is given to us."--Rom. v. 5.

The Holy Ghost, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son is called a
fire, because His action in our souls purifies us from sin and fills us
with divine love. As the action of fire may be said to be irresistible, it
is right that the Holy Ghost be represented by that symbol, since He was
to give spirit and wisdom to Christians, which all their adversaries
should not be able to resist or gainsay.

If we observe the commandments of God, the Holy Spirit will abide with us
to enlighten our minds and strengthen our wills, and give us grace to
follow Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit will give us an increase of devotion
towards the Holy Sacrament of the Altar, and the sacrifice of the Mass,
and will pour the charity of God into our hearts.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


Be devout to the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity. His presence is
everywhere, and His power is manifested in all things. His office in the
Church is that of lifegiver, and in our souls He is the perfect
illumination of the intellect. Without this strength the intellect may be
cultivated, but it will be cold and dim. The errors of our mind, its low
vices and fragmentary opinions, its distorted judgments, unfounded
propositions, and shallow conception of the nature of things, are all
defects traceable to our carelessness in the devotion to the Holy Ghost. A
pious person devoted to the worship of the Holy Spirit will naturally know
God's will and follow it. The degree of his explicit knowledge will still
depend on natural gifts and their due cultivation; but with the docility
of the heart and the influence of the Holy Ghost, there will dawn on his
mind a knowledge which is often superior to that acquired by the intellect
alone. Before and after your actions seek light from this divine Teacher,
and in all your daily life continue in the consciousness of your
dependence on the Holy Ghost.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, and enkindle in them
the fire of Thy love.

_V._ Send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created.

_R._ And Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.

_Let Us Pray._

O God, Who didst instruct the hearts of the faithful by the light of Thy
Holy Spirit, grant us in the same Holy Spirit to relish what is right, and
ever to rejoice in His consolation, through Christ Our Lord. Amen.



Second Day.


St. Edward was one day waiting, in a school at Paris, for the arrival of
his scholars. He was about to expound to them the mystery of the Holy
Trinity. Being tired he fell into a slumber, in which he had a dream. He
saw a dove descending towards him; it bore on its back the sacred Host,
and laid it on his lips. When he awoke he went to the lecture-room, and
began his discourse; all who heard him were struck by the sweetness and
clearness of his explanations. It was the devotion to the Holy Ghost that
gave a newness and a charm to all he said, and impressed itself not only
on his hearers, but also on himself, so that he became full of the unction
and fire of the Spirit of God. We will not be disappointed if we solicit
the interest of the Holy Ghost in our behalf. In all our work let us look
first to this Light of God, which illumines every soul coming into this
world, and our actions will be for the glory of God, our minds will become
energetic through the purification of our motives, and our whole life will
take on a new exterior of humility and perfection.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Third Day.


The Holy Ghost is the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity: this is one of
the dogmas of the Christian religion; it is the foundation of our holy
faith. In God there are three divine persons, the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost. Each person, among created intelligences, is a distinct and a
separate unity, complete, entire in itself, but by its limitation making
only one individual. But in God the three divine persons have one distinct
mode of subsistence, for each possesses in common the whole divine
essence. The substance of God belongs to each of the three divine persons.
Therefore we say that there are three divine persons in God, not three
individuals; for an individual would signify a distinct nature.
Accordingly, the Athanasian creed declares, "Such as the Father is, such
is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost." The Father is God, the Son is
God, and the Holy Ghost is God. Yet there are not three Gods, but only one
God. In speaking of the nature of God's being, we find ourselves
necessarily beyond the power of reasoning; we only know that the infinite
God is one in essence and three in person.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


The Holy Ghost is God, one of the three divine persons, as is evident from
the Scriptures. The Holy Ghost is joined with the Father and the Son, and
therefore He really exists and is called God. All the divine attributes
are given Him: omnipresence, omnipotence, and justice. He is therefore
God, and proceeds from the Father and the Son; He is the Spirit of God,
and also the Spirit of Christ. The Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and
the Son as the breath of the life of intelligence and love. "Because you
are sons, God hath sent the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying:
Abba, Father."--Gal. iv. 6. "But when He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He
will teach you all truth; for He shall not speak of Himself: but
whatsoever things He shall hear He shall speak: ... He shall glorify Me:
because He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it to you. All things
whatsoever the Father hath, are Mine. Therefore I said: that He shall
receive of Mine, and show it to you."--John xvi. 13-15.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


We cannot understand the mystery of the Blessed Trinity. We cannot
understand the persons of the Blessed Trinity, neither the Father, the
Son, nor the Holy Ghost; they are infinite. Still we can think of the
Blessed Trinity, and guided by what we know through revelation and
theology, try to go still further and discover more of the glory
surrounding it. One person of the Holy Trinity is as great as the other;
there is really no first nor second in dignity or power. There is,
however, a marvellous order in the unity of the Trinity, thus expressed in
the creed of St. Athanasius: "The Father is made of none, neither created
nor begotten. The Son is from the Father alone, not made nor created, but
begotten. The Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son, not made nor
created nor begotten, but proceeding." Thus the Holy Trinity exists from
all eternity, supremely happy in itself, not needing anything exteriorly
to assist in its existence.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Sixth Day.


God begets His Son by knowledge; the Son is the knowledge of the Father,
but the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son by way of love. The
Father and the Son, by an act of supreme natural love breathe forth the
co-eternal Spirit. The Spirit proceeds from both, the pledge of their
mutual affection, and the expression of infinite beatitude. The Father
loves the Son with such an infinite love as to breathe forth a divine
Spirit through His Son. As St. Bernard says, the Spirit is the sacred kiss
of the Father and the Son in their imperturbable peace, their firm
coherence, their undivided love, their indivisible unity. The Son proceeds
from the Father as the ray from the sun; the Holy Ghost from the Father
and the Son as the heat from the ray and the sun. The Son as the word, the
Holy Ghost as the breath; the Son as the river from the fountain; the Holy
Ghost as the lightning from the cloud. These expressions hardly convey
what is meant, because the ray is smaller than the sun; while in God the
ray is equal, the heat is consubstantial with its source. The word says
all, the breath is real, the fire burns always and is never extinguished.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


It will be part of the beatitude of the saints to know something of this
generation and procession of the Holy Ghost; they will be filled with
gladness inexpressible in the sight of God. They will see God as He is; in
their contemplation they will rise higher and higher, and by their studies
know more and more of God. As we are charmed with the beauties of
knowledge, the attraction of literature, so we will feel greater happiness
as we study the being of God in all its depths. "O the depths of the
riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are
His judgments, and how unsearchable His ways!"--Rom. xi. 33. The Church, in
the office and Mass of the feast of the most Holy Trinity repeats the same
words, as the expression of her awe and adoration in the presence of the
infinitely unsearchable ways of God in the Trinity. In adoring this life
of God, for life it is indeed, we are overwhelmed with awe, and are but
able in our astonishment to cry out with the Church, "O Blessed Trinity!"

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Eighth Day.


The Holy Trinity does all the work exterior to itself by the joint power
of all; for the persons of God cannot be separated from the one God. There
are certain things which in our human mind we ascribe more to one person
than to the other, but all the divine persons must necessarily be
participants in the work of each. For example, the creation is ascribed to
the Father, because it seems to be a parental act to call something into
existence, and so we say God the Father created us. God the Son redeemed
us, and God the Holy Ghost sanctifies us. And still we read that in the
creation, "The Spirit of the Lord moved over the waters," meaning that God
the Father was not only or singly engaged in the creation, but that the
other divine persons participated also. The same way, in the creation of
man, all the divine persons were engaged in this important work of God's
power. Human beings were to know God, and to become the temples of the
Holy Ghost; and consequently the Holy Ghost had early in the creation to
show His co-operation.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Ninth Day.


Hence, in the beginning of the world, God created a man, framing his body
out of clay and dust, but giving him a living soul by breathing upon him.
It was the Spirit of God that gave that soul the touch of life and
immortality. There is a wonderful similarity between that breathing into
man at his creation, and the time when, after the resurrection, the Lord
appeared to the apostles and breathed on them, saying: "Receive ye the
Holy Ghost." St. Athanasius says, "First by the Word of God, man was made.
And the Lord breathed into him the Spirit of life, and confirmed him with
a participation of His Spirit. The same God confers His Spirit on His
disciples, that we may be renovated in the same Spirit in Whom we first
were made." No doubt both the natural life, the life of the body, and also
the supernatural life, the love of God and participation in His glory,
were granted by the Holy Ghost at the creation.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Tenth Day.


The Holy Ghost infuses into our hearts sanctifying grace, by which we
become pleasing to God, and we can call Him Our Father. What a great grace
this is--to be pleasing to God! We had sinned and had become aliens to
God's kindness and grace. We did not live a simple, natural life, for our
existence was sinful after the fall of Adam and Eve. But the Holy Spirit
came again into our hearts, and we were created new beings. The old scars
of sin and condemnation disappeared, and our present supernatural
condition is nobler, perhaps, than was the condition of Adam before his
fall. It was this consideration which caused the Fathers of the Church,
and the Church herself, in her paschal song of the "Exultet," to exclaim,
"O happy fault, which gave the occasion to almighty God to rescue us from
eternal death, and to give us new life, in the resurrection of the Lord."
Great, then, is the love of the Holy Ghost for us. He wishes to claim us
as His temples.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Eleventh Day.


We are, therefore, different from Adam; since the Fall our condition has
been changed. Adam at his creation was constituted in the state of grace,
placed in that blessed condition by the goodness of the Holy Ghost. The
justice which Adam received was the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the
soul, which illuminated his mind to such a degree that he not only
understood the things about him, but it also gave him a sight of heaven
itself, and the perfections of God. Hence Adam, the pure creature, grand
and noble as he was, created and gifted by almighty God, was a favored
being indeed, and all mankind after him. For we also are created by God,
we have the Holy Spirit dwelling in us by Baptism, and therefore are
children of God by a still greater reason than Adam was. The power of the
Holy Ghost has thus been displayed in the creation of man, in the
continuation of his existence, and in all his work up to the present time.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twelfth Day.


By Adam's disobedience his glory and greatness were swept away. The
presence of the Holy Ghost was forfeited, and in His place reigned
ignorance, weakness, and passion. Man not only ignored God, but fell
deeper and deeper into a degrading ignorance until he lived a life not far
removed from the brute. Man became so weak and unreliable that even if
ignorance was removed by education, his will was subject to the
allurements of interest and passion. Terrible confusion ensued in the ages
after the fall of Adam and Eve. But God had mercy on the human race, and
promised a Redeemer, by Whom we were to regain salvation. Instead of
falling a prey to the devil after death, man had a means of reinstating
himself in the mercy and goodness of God, for, as the Apostle says in his
first epistle to Timothy: "God will have all men to be saved, and to come
to the knowledge of truth." We should appreciate highly this work of our
redemption. Mankind could do nothing of itself. It deserved to die, and
share with the evil spirits eternal damnation, but through the mercy of
God it was not consumed.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Thirteenth Day.


Our justification comes from Christ's redemption, by the operation of the
Holy Ghost. "But you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are
justified in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of Our
God."--1 Cor. vi. 11. It is still the operation of the Holy Ghost which
brings comfort to our souls. Since the Fall, the Spirit of God has
assisted every man that came into the world, so that there never yet was a
soul which had not sufficient grace to escape from eternal death, if it
only had fidelity to correspond with it. Even heathens may, according to
the mercy of God, find the means ready at hand by which to be saved. Every
soul is created in the likeness of God; the light of reason shining in the
soul is a means of salvation, the whole world reveals the existence of
God. Every living soul in the order of nature, then, has the illumination
of God's grace, and by the light of conscience, which is reason, can
rightly exercise its will in the performance of duty. "We hope in the
living God, Who is the Saviour of all men," and especially of the
faithful. The work of the Holy Ghost, even in the order of nature that is
outside of the Church, is going on, giving to all men grace to be saved.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Fourteenth Day.


When the disciples returned to Jerusalem, after the ascension of Our Lord,
they chose for their habitation the cenacle in which the Last Supper had
taken place. There they spent the eight days previous to the feast of
Pentecost, in a retreat of prayer and meditation. There they waited
patiently for the realization of the promise made by Our Lord, that the
Paraclete would come. Their souls were filled with that peace which the
Lord had given them; they had learned the lesson of charity and
submission, they had now one heart and one mind. No doubt, with them in
prayer, were Mary the Mother of Jesus and the pious women who also were to
receive the Holy Spirit. What a consolation was not the presence of Mary
to the apostles! She was now their Mother; Christ Himself desired that she
should be their comfort. The apostles loved the Mother of Jesus, consulted
her about the future of the Church, and no doubt learned from her the
secrets of divine love that filled her soul, learned from her the love
that Jesus bore to His holy Church. They honored her with reverence,
because she was the Mother of Him Whom they now knew to be God. It was the
beginning of the devotion to the Blessed Virgin--a devotion which has
continued in the Church ever since with unabated ardor.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Fifteenth Day.


The apostles persevered in prayer in the holy cenacle. They had learned
the necessity of prayer from Our Lord Himself. He inculcated it by command
and example, and now they put His precepts into execution; they made
prayer the chief preparation for the coming of the Holy Ghost. God was
present among them, and heard them, for they were assembled in the name of
Jesus. These long hours of supplication penetrated heaven and filled the
earth with consolation; bringing upon them the graces and benedictions of
Jesus. They had time to enter into themselves, and to cure their souls of
the weakness of human nature. They had much cause for anxiety. What a
battle, and apparently what a hopeless battle, was before them! They were
to preach to the world; to conquer and to teach it the maxims of the
Christian religion. They knew that the world was not willing to receive
the Gospel, and yet they had to observe the injunction of Our Lord, to
teach all nations, and to command them to observe all that Christ had
taught. The apostles were filled with a great love for the salvation of
mankind, and in the cenacle they began to be apostles of prayer, by which
they were to be victorious over all difficulties.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Sixteenth Day.


At length the retreat of the apostles was over; they were still assembled
in that upper room, the time for the appearance of the Holy Spirit had
arrived, the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity was to come in His
sevenfold power to dwell in the Church of God forever, as well as in the
hearts of all its faithful members. The Holy Ghost came like a mighty
wind, and filled the whole house, and descended on those present in the
form of fiery tongues. How devoutly did they receive the Holy Spirit! With
what acts of adoration did they greet the visible presence of the great
Comforter, the Paraclete, the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity! For
this they had been waiting and praying, for this they had remained away
from the distractions of the world, so that they might undisturbed feel
the power of God in themselves. The Holy Ghost came in the form of tongues
of fire, the same fire of which Our Lord spoke when He exclaimed, "I am
come to send fire on the earth, and what is My will but that it be
kindled?" It was the fire of charity--the charity of Christ, by which we
endeavor to save our souls, and the souls of others.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Seventeenth Day.


The Holy Ghost appeared under the form of tongues of fire, to show us that
out of charity we should raise our voice in the propagation and defence of
truth. The inspiration of the Holy Spirit obliges us to correct others,
and to lead them gently on in the way of salvation. Not only had the
apostles this obligation, but the priest must preach, the father and the
mother instruct their children, and the master guide those under him. It
is this sacred fire that will make the faithful listen with respect to
their pastors, and practise their religion; children will be induced to be
docile to their parents, and subjects will be respectful to those in
authority. This burning fire will purify all men, for the fire of divine
love has a power to consume the gnawing vices of selfishness, indolence,
and jealousy; it will burn up the materials on which our passions feed.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Eighteenth Day.


The apostles were certainly in a worthy condition to receive the Holy
Ghost; they received Him in His fulness, and the effects of His coming
were soon manifest in them. They could no longer contain themselves in
silence in that upper chamber; they were compelled to give utterance to
the truth. They received the gifts of the Holy Ghost, gifts which are the
result of the enlightenment coming from the Spirit of God. We do not
receive the Holy Ghost in the form of fiery tongues at Confirmation, but
we receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost: wisdom, understanding, knowledge,
counsel, piety, fortitude, and fear of the Lord. Let us see what these
gifts are, that we may know that we possess them, and by our study develop
them, that they may not remain idle in our souls. We must stir up the
grace that is in us; we must, during this month, pray that these gifts may
find opportunities for exercise. The apostles showed in their lives that
these gifts were theirs in all perfection. In a lesser or greater degree
we may possess them also, for these virtues should be in every Christian
soul as a result of the visitation of the Holy Spirit.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Nineteenth Day.


The gift of understanding enables us to appreciate the beauty of all
revealed truths. It is not like faith, by which we implicitly accept God's
revelation, but it gives us the reasons for making an act of faith; it
will show us that our faith is true, because it shows us on what
foundation the truth rests. Even after Our Lord's resurrection the
disciples showed that they did not understand what they had been told.
They did not understand the Scriptures, for Our Lord had to upbraid the
apostles for their incredulity and hardness of heart. Did He not reproach
the two disciples returning to Emmaus with a slowness of understanding,
because they were still wavering in the faith of the crucified Jesus? The
apostles needed the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, in order to comprehend
the Scriptures and the prophecies made concerning their Master. The gift
of understanding shows us the necessity of virtues in ourselves, so that
we may be willing to study them and to acquire them; it shows us the
goodness of others and makes us appreciate their labors; it gives us
insight into the order of things, that we may submit ourselves to
authority and be docile to the teachings of the Church.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twentieth Day.


The gift of wisdom is a superior discernment of good and evil; it gives
men a real taste and predilection for all that is good and holy, all that
is connected with God and divine things; it turns their eyes to God, and
teaches them to look at everything from God's point of view. It makes them
love prayer, recollection, good conversation, and good reading. This is a
great gift of the Holy Ghost, and one that seems to prefigure our
predestination, because it places before our minds so vividly the
necessity of doing good in order to go to heaven. How little of this
heavenly wisdom do we generally possess! Wise enough are we in the ways of
the world; we know how to make money, and to hoard it up; but we care
little how to gain spiritual treasures. Do we not class ourselves with the
children of the world by our smartness in gathering earthly goods? Our
Lord said the children of the world were wiser in their generation than
the children of light. He praises them, not to have us imitate them, but
to put us on our guard against the false wisdom which is so easily
acquired. The apostles, in the beginning of their election to the
apostolic life, had not that heavenly wisdom, for they had very worldly
ideas about the kingdom which they thought Jesus was to establish on
earth.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-first Day.


Knowledge is the possession of truth. When our mind is well stored with
information we are said to have knowledge. The same may be said of
spiritual knowledge, only it refers to spiritual things. We have
knowledge, then, in a spiritual sense, when we put together our
experiences and draw practical conclusions from them--when we realize that
God created the world, and that we were created to save our souls. Hence
we ought to use the world, not for our own exclusive enjoyment, nor for
the purpose of amassing wealth, but for the greater glory of God. We know
that we were placed on the earth, intelligent beings, to praise and serve
God. It was in virtue of this knowledge that St. Ignatius declared that
all the world around him recalled God to him. We too must see God in all
things, and never lose sight of the end of our creation; those who love
the world for its own sake cannot love God; we cannot serve God and
Mammon; we know from our own bitter experience that as soon as we love the
world, we have lost the love of God, and without the love of God it is
impossible to go to heaven. The absence of this spiritual knowledge makes
us impatient because we have not all the things we want, and we resist His
holy will.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-second Day.


The gift of counsel contains all that is good in human prudence, and much
more. It leads us always to pause and to turn our thoughts to God before
we act; we avoid precipitation, rashness, and inconsiderate impulses. It
makes us calm and deliberate, and teaches us never to act in any important
matter without seeking guidance from God. This gift also shows us that it
is God's will to run counter to what the world considers prudent. So
Abraham did when he left his home at God's command, and went to the land
which God chose for him, where the people of God were to live together and
he was to be their spiritual as well as their real father. So David, when
a poor boy, went out at God's command to fight the giant, armed only with
a stone and sling. Judith was moved by the same impulse when she went to
the camp of Holofernes, and brought his head back into the city. It is
also our duty that when we know the will of God we do it generously, no
matter what difficulties may beset our paths. The gift of counsel will
also put into our mouth that encouragement for others which will help them
to lead a life of virtue and patience, remembering that the trials of life
last but a short time.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-third Day.


The Holy Ghost also infuses into our soul the gift of piety--that loyal,
tender, filial affection towards God as Our Father. "You have received,"
says St. Paul, "the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba,
Father."--Rom. viii. 15. By this sacred gift we forget ourselves and cling
only to God, Who is our support and help. We love God, and serve Him with
alacrity, because He is Our Father in heaven. If I am a son of God, loyal
to my Father in heaven, every act of mine, every thought, is centred in
Him. Such was the intense love of the apostles for Our Lord; from the time
when He chose them, the virtue of piety was implanted in them, though it
was only perfected after the death of Christ. It was after the ascension
of Our Lord, when the Holy Spirit had fully inspired this virtue in their
souls, that they began to have a filial affection towards Our Lord, a keen
attachment of love and affection. Do we realize the meaning of the gift of
piety? We ought to be anxious to possess this virtue, because it makes the
burden of the service of God easy: "where there is love, there is no
labor."

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-fourth Day.


The gift of fortitude is necessary in some degree to one who is anxious to
save his soul. All Christians are called on, at some time or other, to
endure in the practice of their religion things for which mere human
courage will not suffice. Those who desire a high place in heaven have a
hard struggle before them, a struggle which would be beyond the power of
many of us if we did not rely on the Holy Ghost. The gift of fortitude is
the power to be strong of soul as the athlete is strong of body; for as a
man hardens and develops his frame by all sorts of physical exercises, so
also should the soul develop the good that is in her--which is the highest
good--by spiritual exercises. Of her own power she is not able to do great
things, but by the work of God the Holy Ghost she can do them. We can bear
heavy sorrows with patience and resignation; we can rise out of vices and
evil habits by means of fortitude, when without this virtue we would
remain slaves of Satan. How pusillanimous were the apostles in the
beginning of their apostolic career; there was a disgraceful weakness
exhibited at the Passion of Our Lord. Peter denied Our Lord, and the rest
fled and hid themselves.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-fifth Day.


The gift on which we wish to meditate to-day in honor of the giver, the
Holy Ghost, is the fear of the Lord. Remember that it is said that the
fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; we need then this holy gift,
that by it we may remain in subjection and reverence to the adorable
majesty of God. We acknowledge our littleness and leave ourselves entirely
in the hands of God; we are afraid of committing sin, we are cautious,
lest by an act or thought we may offend almighty God; we are careful to
submit ourselves to His holy will; we see our faults, and we lament that
we are so full of sin, when we ought, with His grace, to improve in His
service. We must stand in dread of the Judgment and also of ourselves,
because we fall so readily into sin that we know not whether we are worthy
of love or hatred from almighty God; but when we fall it is our own fault,
for we depend too much on ourselves; we are wicked because we prefer evil
to good, and would rather serve the devil than God. Let us learn this
salutary fear of God, and acquire a delicacy of conscience.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-sixth Day.


We have now meditated on the gifts of the Holy Ghost. We see how generous
the adorable Spirit is. He is constantly giving Himself and yet is never
exhausted, so that we are rich indeed by the goodness of the Holy Ghost.
Our mind is enlightened, and we pray to the Holy Spirit to open our hearts
and to enkindle in them the fire of divine love. Before all our actions we
call on the sacred Spirit to help us, so that our actions may be done
well, an honor to God and a source of merit to ourselves. On the feast of
Pentecost we celebrate other gifts: as the gift of "language," which is
the means by which the Gospel is spread all over the world. Again was
given by the Holy Ghost the gift of "healing." The first Christians were
able to work miracles. We have lost confidence; had we the same strong
faith many wonders would also happen at our bidding.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-seventh Day.


The Holy Ghost has also other gifts in store for us, gifts which are
called fruits--as if from this divine tree were growing a variety of
different virtues, diffused from united efforts. There must be some result
from this expenditure of power, and when we are good Christians we will
certainly enjoy these gifts and fruits: they will grow on the tree of the
Holy Ghost and will be reproduced in our hearts. These fruits are twelve
in number: Charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, long-
suffering, mildness, faith, modesty, continency, and chastity. Charity is
a love and kindness towards all mankind; we love all the members of the
human family and we are interested in their welfare; we are continually
searching for means to help them, and all for the one purpose: the good of
their immortal souls. By this virtue we are moved to share our goods with
others, contenting ourselves with what is necessary. Another beautiful
fruit of the Holy Ghost is eternal joy. Our souls are continually
rejoicing in God, Who is our great reward.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-eighth Day.


Peace is a gift of the Holy Ghost, somewhat similar to joy; if we have
peace nothing can disturb our soul; even if we are afflicted we are not
out of humor, for we see that it is the will of God, Who is our kind
Father, and that everything is for our special benefit. We are at peace
with our fellow-creatures, for we are not actuated by inordinate ambition,
nor by grasping avarice, so that we are loved by all. Patience is a gift
of the Holy Spirit by which we endure the ills of the flesh without a
murmur and with resignation. What a beautiful virtue and gift we have in
this. We love the virtue in others, and we must endeavor to possess it
also in ourselves, so as to be a spectacle of patience to men and angels.
With benignity, goodness, and mildness, we meet others and charm them with
our kindness; they are virtues that result from the thorough practice of
charity; it is the combination of these virtues that makes true Christian
politeness. What a beautiful world this would be if every one in it would
be imbued with these sentiments.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Twenty-ninth Day.


Faith is a holy gift of trust in God, in His holy revelation, in the
Church, her precepts and teaching, her discipline, and her devotions. We
realize and form our conduct on these matters of faith, so that they
become the foundation of our hope and our consolation in trials. God
becomes to us a living reality, not a vague speculation; and the Church
the representative of God on earth, the spouse of Jesus Christ. The just
man lives by faith and in the faith; he is full of the trust, the justice,
and the mercy of God. Modesty is a fruit of the possession of the Holy
Ghost, because by it we are retired, unassuming, caring nothing for the
show and allurements of the world. Prayer, meditation, and pious reading
should be our favorite occupations, in which we would find a great deal of
pleasure; our duties would be well performed, because we would set our
whole mind on them in all the quietness of our soul. Continency and
chastity are also the result of the presence in our soul of the Holy
Spirit; we abhor the pleasures of sensuality, and keep ourselves pure from
all contamination, according to the state of life which we have chosen or
in which we find ourselves.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Thirtieth Day.


The fruits and gifts of the Holy Ghost may be easily seen in the effects
the apostles experienced at the coming of the Paraclete. As we noticed,
the apostles were rather worldly in their perceptions of the divine
intentions; they manifested their frailty in many ways during the life of
Christ, so that they were even publicly rebuked by Our Lord. But now they
have become apostolic men; they love poverty, and are content to work at
their humble trade in order not to be a burden on the newly made converts.
As St. Peter asserts, "He desired the money of no man." They love
sufferings, from which they had so often shrank before. They understand
that to suffer for Christ was great glory and consolation--they who before
had been narrow, selfish, and ready to condemn others, now become full of
charity to all the world. Into their heart the Spirit of love has
descended, and their motto becomes charity towards others. The charity of
Christ is the one motive of all they think and do.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.



Thirty-first Day.


We see another great change in the apostles by means of the presence of
the Holy Ghost; they surprise us by the bold stand they take before the
Jewish authorities. We know they were timid and cowardly at the
apprehension of Our Lord, and were almost scandalized at His death on the
cross. Now they challenge the Jews with a freedom of speech that the chief
priests are unable to explain; they face the wrath of the Jewish council,
the Sanhedrim; and undismayed they say: "Judge for yourselves if it be
just in the sight of God to hear you, rather than God." If then the
apostles become such perfect men by the influence of the Holy Ghost, is it
not worth our while also to remain in prayer and meditation on the power
of the Holy Ghost, in order that we too may be changed from such weaklings
and become strong Christians? How little have we in us of this Holy
Spirit, how unwilling we are to suffer, how prone to avoid all that is
opposed to our natural inclinations! This should be different; and it can
only be different by heeding the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. With this
intention and for this purpose let us devote some time, now and then, to
the stirring up within us of the grace of the Holy Ghost.

Prayer.

Come, Holy Ghost, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, etc., etc.

Hymns to the Holy Ghost.



Veni, Creator Spiritus.


Come, O Creator, Spirit blest,
And in our souls take up Thy rest;
Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid
To fill the hearts which Thou hast made.

Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry,
O highest gift of God most high,
O Fount of life, O Fire of love,
And sweet anointing from above.

Thou in thy sevenfold gifts art known;
The finger of God's hand we own;
The promise of the Father Thou,
Who dost the tongue with pow'r endow.

Our senses kindle from above,
And make our hearts o'erflow with love;
With patience firm and virtue high
The weakness of our flesh supply.

Drive far from us the foe we dread,
And grant us Thy true peace instead;
So shall we not, with Thee for guide,
Turn from the path of life aside.

Oh, may Thy grace on us bestow
The Father and the Son to know,
And Thee through endless times confess'd
Of both th' eternal Spirit blest.

All glory, while the ages run,
Be to the Father and the Son
Who rose from death; the same to Thee,
O Holy Ghost, eternally! Amen.



Come, Holy Ghost.


Come, Holy Ghost, send down those beams,
Which sweetly flow in silent streams
    From Thy bright throne above.
Come, Thou, the Father of the poor,
Thou bounteous source of all our store;
    Come, fire our hearts with love.

Come, Thou, of comforters the best,
Come, Thou, the soul's delightful guest,
    The pilgrim's sweet relief.
Thou art our rest in toil and sweat,
Refreshment in excessive heat,
    And solace in our grief.

O sacred Light, shoot home Thy darts,
Oh, pierce the centre of these hearts,
    Whose faith aspires to Thee.
Without Thy Godhead nothing can
Have any price or worth in man;
    Nothing can harmless be.

Lord, wash our sinful stains away,
Water from heaven our barren clay;
    Our wounds and bruises heal.
To Thy sweet yoke our stiff necks bend,
To inflame our cold hearts Thy fire send;
    Our wandering feet repel.

Oh, grant Thy faithful, dearest Lord,
Whose only hope is Thy sure word;
    The seven gifts of Thy Spirit.
Grant us in life to obey Thy grace,
Grant us in death to see Thy face;
    And endless joys inherit. Amen.




Act Of Oblation To The Holy Ghost.


On my knees, before the great cloud of witnesses, I offer myself, soul and
body, to Thee, eternal Spirit of God. I adore the brightness of Thy
purity; the unerring keenness of Thy justice; and the might of Thy love.
Thou art the strength and the light of my soul. In Thee I live and move
and am. I desire never to grieve Thee by unfaithfulness to grace; and I
pray with all my heart to be kept from the smallest sin against Thee. Make
me faithful in every thought: and grant that I may always listen to Thy
voice, and watch for Thy light, and follow Thy gracious inspirations. I
cling to Thee, and give myself to Thee, and ask Thee by Thy compassion to
watch over me in my weakness. Holding the pierced feet of Jesus, and
looking at His five wounds and trusting to His precious blood, and adoring
His opened side and stricken Heart, I implore Thee, adorable Spirit,
helper of my infirmity, so to keep me in Thy grace that I may never sin
against Thee with the sin which Thou canst not forgive. Give me grace, O
Holy Ghost, Spirit of the Father and the Son, to say to Thee, always and
everywhere, speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth. Amen.

Novena to the Holy Ghost.


First Day: Fruits Of Charity And Joy.

_Veni Creator._

Let us prostrate ourselves before the majesty of the most Holy Trinity,
and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary, to obtain, by the merits of Jesus ascended, the fruits of the
Holy Ghost--charity and joy.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

O most holy Spirit, the Paraclete, we adore Thee with all humility; and
with the most lively affections of our hearts, we beseech Thee to assist
us in this Thy novena, that we may rightly prepare ourselves to receive
Thy heavenly gifts. We cannot, O divine Spirit, receive Thee without Thine
own aid preventing us. Without Thee we cannot please Thee. Do Thou then,
Who didst prepare the heart of Mary to receive the Word Incarnate,
vouchsafe so to dispose our hearts that we may happily conceive the
blessed flames of Thy love. Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him,
  The love of Sire and Son,
The consubstantial breath of God,
  The co-eternal One!

Ah! see, how like the Incarnate Word,
  His blessed self He lowers
To dwell with us invisibly,
  And make His riches ours.

Most loving Spirit! Mighty God!
  Sweet must Thy presence be,
If loss of Jesus can be gain,
  So long as we have Thee!

Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, and kindle in them the
fire of Thy love.

_V._ Send forth Thy spirit, and they shall be created.

_R._ And Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.

Burn, O Lord, with the fire of Thy Holy Spirit our reins and our hearts,
that we may serve Thee with chaste bodies, and please Thee with clean
hearts; through Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the unity of the same. Amen.

May the blessing of almighty God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, descend
upon us now, and abide with us always. Amen.

Second Day: Fruits Of Peace And Patience.

_Veni Creator._

Let us prostrate ourselves before the majesty of the most Holy Trinity,
and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary, to obtain, by the merits of Jesus ascended, the fruits of the
Holy Ghost--peace and patience.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

O sweetest and most dear Mother Mary, behold us at thy feet, and having
kissed them a thousand times with the lips of our hearts, we humbly
implore of thee a favor more needful for us than all else in the world.
Since thou art the spouse of the Holy Ghost, the dispenser of His
treasures, and His sweet stewardess, since thou hast been enriched beyond
all other creatures with His heavenly gifts, obtain for us, as thou didst
obtain for the apostles, His coming into our hearts; and for this end
obtain for us the grace to imitate, so far as in us lies, the examples of
thy humility, thy purity, thy charity. Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him, etc.

Come, Holy Spirit, etc.

_V._ and _R._ Send forth Thy Spirit, etc.

O God, to Whom every heart is open and every will speaketh, and from Whom
no secrets are hid, cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the infusion of
the Holy Ghost, that we may perfectly love Thee and worthily praise Thee;
through Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the unity of the same. Amen.

May the blessing, etc.

Third Day: Fruits Of Benignity And Goodness.

_Veni Creator._

and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary, to obtain, by the merits of Jesus ascended, the fruits of the
Holy Ghost--benignity and goodness.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

Most holy prince of the apostles, blessed St. Peter, behold us at thy
feet, to implore thy aid in obtaining the Holy Spirit. We, indeed, have
been unfaithful to Our Redeemer, not three times only, as thou wert, but
thousands and thousands of times; so that we could not hope that the
spotless Dove would vouchsafe to descend into our poor souls, stained with
so many sins; yet thine example, blessed apostle, gives us boldness. Thou
didst weep bitterly, and with thy tears wert so cleaned as to receive all
the gifts of the divine Paraclete. We too desire to bewail our sins with
bitterest grief like thine, while we humbly implore thine intercession to
obtain for us, first of all, cleanness of heart, and then the gift of the
Holy Ghost, for which we yearn most earnestly. Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him, etc.

Come, Holy Spirit, etc.

_V._ and _R._ Send forth Thy Spirit, etc.

O God, Who hast taught the hearts of Thy faithful by the light of the Holy
Spirit, grant us by the same Spirit to think the things that be right, and
ever to rejoice in His consolations; through the same Jesus Christ. In the
unity of the same. Amen.

May the blessing, etc.

Fourth Day: Fruits Of Long-Suffering And Mildness.

_Veni Creator._

Let us prostrate ourselves before the majesty of the most Holy Trinity,
and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary, to obtain, by the merits of Jesus ascended, the fruits of the
Holy Ghost--long-suffering and mildness.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

O blessed and happy apostles of Our Lord, who in the upper room did
receive the Holy Spirit with such fulness that thou wert sweetly
inebriated with divine love, we congratulate thee with the most humble and
lively affection, and contemplate thy graces with a holy envy. We beseech
thee, by that love which thou dost bear the Holy Spirit, Who thus filled
thee with His special benedictions, obtain for us efficacious aid rightly
to practise that brotherly concord, that continual prayer, and that tender
devotion to Mary, whereby we can obtain, even as thou didst obtain, the
coming of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him, etc.

Come, Holy Spirit, etc.

_V._ and _R._ Send forth Thy Spirit, etc.

May the infusion of the Holy Spirit, O Lord, purify our hearts, and by the
inward sprinkling of His gracious dew make them fertile in all good works;
through Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the unity of the same. Amen.

May the blessing, etc.

Fifth Day: Fruits Of Faith And Modesty.

_Veni Creator._

Let us prostrate ourselves before the majesty of the most Holy Trinity,
and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary, to obtain, by the merits of Jesus ascended, the fruits of the
Holy Ghost--faith and modesty.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

O eternal Father, how shall we ever bless and praise Thee sufficiently, or
thank Thy goodness as we ought? A thousand times blessed be Thine infinite
charity, Thine infinite providence, and Thine infinite mercy, which moved
Thee to repair our miseries, and to give unto us a gift wherein is
contained all the good that proceedeth from Thee! Thou hast given us also
the Holy Ghost, Who proceedeth from Thy will as Thine uncreated love. What
can we seek for more? And what shall we give unto Thee for so great a
gift? O Lord, vouchsafe, we beseech Thee, of Thy clemency to take for
Thine own all our understanding, all our will, all ourselves, and that
little for all eternity. Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him, etc.

Come, Holy Spirit, etc.

_V._ and _R._ Send forth Thy Spirit, etc.

We beseech Thee, O Lord, that the Paraclete, Who proceedeth from Thee, may
enlighten our minds, and, according to the promise of Thy Son, may lead us
into all truth; through Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the unity of the same.
Amen.

May the blessing, etc.

Sixth Day: Fruits Of Continence And Chastity.

_Veni Creator._

Let us prostrate ourselves before the majesty of the most Holy Trinity,
and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary, to obtain, by the merits of Jesus ascended, the fruits of the
Holy Ghost--continence and chastity.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

Most holy, most divine Spirit, if there be any souls in the world more
needful of Thine aid than others, it is surely ours, blinded by passions,
chilled with obstinate lukewarmness, and defiled with a thousand
imperfections. Come, then, O divine Spirit! come and enlighten us; kindle
our fervor, and destroy in us all that is displeasing in Thy sight. The
greater our miseries are, so much the more glorious will be Thy triumph
over our perversity. Come and create in us new hearts, which shall have
all for God, and nothing for the world. Create in us clean hearts, O God.
Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him, etc.

Come, Holy Spirit, etc.

_V._ and _R._ Send forth Thy Spirit, etc.

Grant unto Thy Church, O merciful God, that she, being gathered together
in the Holy Spirit, may be in no wise disturbed by the incursions of her
enemies; through Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the unity of the same. Amen.

May the blessing, etc.

Seventh Day: Descent Of The Holy Ghost Upon Mary At The Annunciation.

_Veni Creator._

Let us prostrate ourselves before the majesty of the most Holy Trinity,
and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary in honor of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the ever-blessed
Mother of God at the Annunciation.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

Most divine Spirit, the Paraclete, we hardly dare to beseech Thee to come
into our souls, knowing well how sinful and defiled they are. It seems an
intolerable boldness to invite God--yea, no less a one than God!--to be a
guest in a lodging so unclean. Yet Thou vouchsafest graciously to reassure
us by that infinite goodness of Thine, whereby Thou dost dispose with Thy
prevenient graces those hearts which Thou dost condescend to honor with
Thy presence. O blessed Spirit, deign to come into us, and delay not Thy
gracious coming, while we cease not calling upon Thee and beseeching Thee
to console us with Thy long-expected coming. Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him, etc.

Come, Holy Spirit, etc.

_V._ and _R._ Send forth Thy Spirit, etc.

We beseech Thee of Thy goodness, O Lord, to pour into our minds the Holy
Spirit, by Whose wisdom we were created, and by Whose providence we are
ruled; through Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the unity of the same. Amen.

May the blessing, etc.

Eighth Day: Descent Of The Holy Ghost Upon Jesus At The Jordan.

_Veni Creator._

Let us prostrate ourselves before the majesty of the most Holy Trinity,
and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary in honor of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon Jesus at the
Jordan.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

Most adorable Trinity, we venture with all humility and awe to approach
the lofty throne of your exalted majesty; with our heads prostrated in the
dust we adore you, and give you endless thanks for the immense blessings
which you have bestowed on us miserable men. We thank Thee, O eternal
Father, and Thee, O divine Son, for the gift which you have given us of
the Holy Ghost; for in giving us this Love, Who proceedeth from you, you
have given us your own selves. We thank Thee, O Holy Ghost, Who art at
once the gift and the giver of all gifts, and we most earnestly beseech
Thee to give us Thyself. No other gift but Thine own self can satisfy our
souls, and having Thee alone we shall have all things. But what can we
give Thee in exchange for so great benefits? O blessed Spirit, vouchsafe
of Thy mercy to accept for all eternity all our thoughts, all our
affections, and all ourselves. Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him, etc.

Come, Holy Spirit, etc.

_V._ and _R._ Send forth Thy Spirit, etc.

Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, that we may burn with that fire of the
Holy Ghost which Our Lord Jesus Christ sent upon the earth, and which He
desired to be vehemently enkindled; through Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the
unity of the same. Amen.

May the blessing, etc.

Ninth Day: Transfiguration And Ascension Of Our Lord, And The
Manifestations Of The Holy Ghost.

_Veni Creator._

Let us prostrate ourselves before the majesty of the most Holy Trinity,
and uniting our dispositions with those of our blessed Lady and the holy
apostles in the upper room at Jerusalem, let us say one Our Father and one
Hail Mary in honor of the transfiguration and ascension of our most dear
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the ineffable love of the Holy Ghost
in all His manifestations to His creatures.

Our Father, Hail Mary.

Most holy Virgin and exalted Mother of God, who wast above all creatures
disposed to receive the Holy Ghost, and who didst receive Him with greater
fulness than all others; dispose, we beseech thee, by thy gracious aid,
our cold hearts for the approaching solemnity of Pentecost. We fly to
thee, most benignant Mother of sinners, that thou mayest obtain for us a
lively contrition for our sins; so that although we cannot receive the
Holy Ghost, as innocent, like thyself, yet may we receive Him as true
penitents, together with those Gentile penitents who received Him in the
upper room. Grant this, most holy Mother, not for our merits, for we have
none, but out of thine own exceeding goodness, and that great love which
thou bearest to the same blessed Spirit, Who hast chosen thee for His
Spouse. Amen.

O let us fall and worship Him, etc.

Come, Holy Spirit, etc.

_V._ and _R._ Send forth Thy Spirit, etc.

Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty God, that the splendor of Thy brightness
may shine upon us; and that the light of Thy light may, by the
illumination of the Holy Spirit, confirm the hearts of those who by grace
are regenerate; through Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the unity of the same.
Amen.

May the blessing of almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, descend
upon us, and remain with us always. Amen.





SEPTEMBER. THE IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY.


This month is generally devoted to the consideration of the Heart of Mary
and her Seven Dolors. Not only should we have a special devotion to the
Sacred Heart of Jesus, but there are good reasons for us to have a
devotion to the heart of Mary, so full of love for us, and to her dolors
in connection with the redemption of mankind. Her life was full of sorrow,
because she was actuated by the same sentiments as Our Lord in His desire
to redeem us from the slavery of Satan. What heart, in fact, has ever been
so intimately identified with that of Jesus as was Mary's? He died on the
cross, and Mary stood beneath it, faithful to the end.

Our Lord, in His thirty years' ministry, labored among the people,
preaching and healing the sick, and Mary was certainly in perfect sympathy
with Him in His great work. We are struck with the adorable goodness of
His divine Heart, and for the same reason we are attracted to the heart of
Mary.

We will, then, during this month of September, pray to the heart of our
beloved Mother, setting before our minds the goodness of that loving heart
towards her children in this vale of tears. Let us love and honor these
two hearts so intimately united; let us go to God the Father through the
Heart of Jesus: and to the divine Saviour through the heart of Mary. We
can obtain all things from the Father and the Holy Ghost through the Heart
of Jesus; and all things from the Son through the heart of His blessed
Mother.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


Nowhere in the Old Testament, do we approach God more closely than in the
book of Job, where we see the great prophet of God enduring so patiently
the many sufferings that God has permitted; and nowhere do we recognize
Him as the great Father good and kind to His children as in the same book.
Job was a figure of Christ. There is something very holy in suffering
endured in compliance to the will of God. To-day, then, we are to begin to
think of Mary's sorrowful heart, and we will contemplate how the
mysterious ways of Providence, the love of God, His mercy and kindness,
inflicts chastisements on the Mother of His much loved Son. In the silence
of the thirty years of Christ on earth, in the silence of the hours of
agony on the cross, and in the silence of Mary underneath the cross, we
will see the silence of a heart filled with sorrow, which God is imposing
on His children for the good of mankind. The Church sets before our minds
the seven sorrows of Mary, telling us the principal causes of her great
grief in the life of Jesus.

Prayer.

O heart of Mary, I offer, I consecrate to thee my heart! Thou shalt be the
object of my veneration, love and confidence; I will pay thee my devotions
every day; I will celebrate thy feasts with joy; I will proclaim thy
greatness and thy goodness without ceasing. I will neglect no means of
obtaining for thee the honor and the homage which are due unto thee. I
will bring all the thoughts and affections of my heart into conformity
with thine, and I will make it my duty to imitate thy virtues, especially
thy purity and thy humility. Vouchsafe, O Mary, to open thy heart and
receive me therein. Amen.



Second Day.


Mary's sole enjoyment in this world was the presence of her divine Son.
One never reads of her enjoying what the world calls recreation. The life
of Mary was full of deep love and holy virtue, and when trials came she
patiently and sweetly endured them for the love of God. It was meet, she
knew, that she should suffer, for her intimate connection with the Son of
God made suffering necessary. The first sword of sorrow which pierced her
heart were the words of Simeon in the Temple. When the days of her
purification were passed, Mary, according to the Law of Moses, came to the
Temple, bearing in her arms the Infant Jesus. The spirit of God manifested
in Jesus and Mary was a spirit of obedience to the Law of the time in
which they lived. In comparison to Mary, the angels' purity became dim,
and still she subjected herself to the ceremony of purification. The law
presupposed impurity, but in Mary we know that there was not the least
stain of sin or imperfection. Humbly she carried the Lord to the Temple;
and humbly, too, Joseph walked by her side, bearing the two turtle doves
for a sacrifice and a ransom for the Child Jesus, which was also according
to the Law.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Third Day.


The aged arms of the feeble old priest embraced the Child, and all turned
to enter the building. Simeon bore the weight of the Creator of heaven and
earth, yet stood erect, strengthened and consoled. The advent of that
Child must have given the old man a manifestation of the greatness and the
glory of heaven, and unspeakable joy must have shone forth from his
countenance. Then old Simeon remembered the revelation which he had
received from the Holy Spirit: that he would not see death until he had
held in his arms the anointed of the Lord; and now he bears Him, a feeble
child. He finds it hard to return that precious burden to Mary, who stands
there with motherly solicitude, yearning to receive back again her beloved
Child. But the flood-gates of thanks to almighty God have been opened, and
Simeon's heart and lips break forth in a most sublime and prophetic song.
Zachary sang his _Benedictus_ at the circumcision of St. John; Mary sang
her _Magnificat_ at Elizabeth's home, and now Simeon pours forth his soul
in a sublime prayer: "Now Thou dost dismiss Thy servant, O Lord, according
to Thy word in peace: because my eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou
hast prepared before the face of all peoples: a light to the revelation of
the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel."

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


But now he changes his words of joy into a sorrowful prophecy; the aged
priest proceeds, "Behold, this Child is set for the fall and for the
resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be
contradicted: and thy own soul a sword shall pierce that out of many
hearts thoughts may be revealed." Mary was silent, but a cloud of fear for
the future passed over her, as Simeon foretold all that was to afflict
her. This was her first sorrow: to be told that her Child was to be set
for the fall and redemption of many. A sea of trouble flooded the soul of
Mary; it seemed as if Jesus Himself was causing that sorrow, and sent it
directly into her heart. But Mary was brave, as she was through all her
sorrows; there was no change in her. The Light of the world had burst out,
in the arms of Simeon, and then followed a dreadful darkness. Suddenly
Mary found herself far from the joys of Bethlehem in the darkness of
Golgotha, but she was just as resigned in her sorrow as she was content in
her joy. Mary understood now that the life of her divine Son was to be a
constant martyrdom, and that the end of it would be the death on the
cross.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


This was the great sacrifice that Mary made of her beloved Son. She was
resigned to the will of God, though she knew the unavoidable future. She
had given to God a sacrifice in every way equal to God; never had such a
sacrifice been made from the beginning of the world. She had surpassed the
angels in constant prayer, she had made a more acceptable offering than
the ancient priests of God: because here was offered to God, Jesus Christ,
the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, and the equal of God the Father.
It was in sympathy with her divine Son and out of love for mankind that
Mary offered this holy sacrifice. He was her Son, and yet, from this
moment, she was not to possess Him as her own; she was only to guard the
Victim for the day of the great sacrifice. Mary knew that it was not for
her joy and consolation that Jesus was born; it was for a higher purpose
that He came into the world. She resigned all the joy His coming brought
to her, and offered Him a sacrifice to almighty God. Her heart is full of
wounds as she sees the persecutions of the Jews, the infidelity and
hardness of heart of many.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Sixth Day.


What lessons may we draw from the first sorrow of Mary--from the prophecy
of Simeon, which changed her whole future life? The sorrows of Mary lasted
all her lifetime; she suffered without looking for consolation; she
suffered in the depth of her heart, supported only by God's goodness.
Mary's griefs were intimately united to the sufferings of Jesus; her
sorrows were caused by His sufferings, and with these Mary was in perfect
sympathy. It is in this way that we should live, and suffer our trials and
troubles in perfect union with those of Jesus Christ, Our Lord and
Saviour. We can make of them a perfect sacrifice to God, simply because
they are connected with a little pain. We must consider ourselves happy if
God chastises us in this world, because He intends to make us better; we
suffer because we have sinned; sin claims a punishment and we should be
satisfied to be punished for our sins, and to give some atonement for
them; they can hardly be called sacrifices when they are well-merited
punishments. Still it is possible, even while we justly suffer for our
sins, to make our sufferings more meritorious by uniting them to those of
Our Lord. With joy we can look up to the Mother of sorrows, and suffer,
like her, with patience and resignation.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


The second sword of sorrow that pierced the heart of Mary was the flight
into Egypt. Simeon was the author and instrument in the hand of God of the
first sorrow; Joseph was the great figure in her second sorrow. It seems
to heighten whatever sufferings we may have to undergo when they are
caused by those whom we love. This was the case now, and this sword of
sorrow was so much the more cruel as the visitation did not seem to come
from God, but from the cruelty of men. In this sorrow the hand of man was
raised against the Lord, to put Him out of the way. It was like the
crucifixion on Mount Calvary, for His death was intended, and on Calvary
really executed. Mary and Joseph had to make arrangements for the hasty
journey to an unknown country, in order to guard the Infant Jesus from the
persecutions of Herod. Mary had to go to a country where there was no
worship of the true God; there were temples only of impure idolatry.
Alone, destitute, and wandering about, there was no human consolation in
this exile; she was deprived of the practice of her religion, her spirit
yearned after the courts of the house of God, with the multitude of
worshippers gathered there on feast days; she loved the ceremonies of the
old synagogue. In this secret sorrow she passed the days of her exile,
until God relieved her by permitting her to return.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Eighth Day.


The most sorrowful feeling produced in the heart of Mary by her exile in
Egypt, was caused by the thought of the hatred man had conceived against
the Lord. This adorable Child carefully concealed every manifestation of
His divine power. There was never on this earth a more lovable object than
this Child, and yet man had turned against Him from the very first moment
of His birth. It caused her heart great suffering to see that mankind did
not appreciate the presence of the Incarnate Word; that it neglected the
consideration of God's goodness towards it. But how much more does she
suffer when she beholds Him an object of persecution! He is a fugitive
from the society of those very people whom He comes to save. All this Mary
must have felt; for she loved her divine Son with a great natural love,
and watched over Him with motherly solicitude. She loved Him also with a
divine love, for she knew He was the Son of God, the Redeemer of mankind.
This second sword of sorrow was not the transient realization of a
mystery, which took place and then was over. No, it was a lasting sorrow,
spreading itself over her whole life, for that persecution lasted until He
died on the cross amid the shouts of an unfeeling people.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Ninth Day.


The flight into Egypt has ever been a fruitful source of meditation for
devout souls; it is a beautiful but at the same time a sorrowful event in
the life of Christ. We, the descendants of the heathens, date God's
visitation to us from this time, because Our Lord fled from His own people
and visited those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death. With His
presence He sanctified the heathen country, and with it all the dark
continents of the world where God's name was not known. Amid these
benighted people He, at least for a time, found a refuge and found peace.
The three Wise Men had departed for their own country without notifying
Herod of the success of their search for the King of Jerusalem. This
stirred up his cruel spirit, and with a murderous will he tried to destroy
the Child. The streets of Bethlehem were stained with the blood of the
little ones, but the Child Jesus, as we know, was not harmed. What a
sorrow was caused by the coming of Christ! Mary knew of it, for the sound
of the wailings of desolate mothers had been carried to her ears, and her
heart must have been touched by their cries. But to these children what a
happy day it was, on which they gave their lives for the Infant Jesus! It
was their baptism of blood; the world was in sorrow, but there was joy in
heaven.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Tenth Day.


At the command of the angel, Mary and Joseph took the Child, and promptly
entered upon their journey to Egypt. Without anxiety for the future, they
were in no trepidation at leaving Bethlehem. Mary wrapped the Child in
clothing to protect Him from the cold and pressed Him to her bosom; they
then went forth into the starlit night. Poverty has not many preparations
to make. The secret path which they took in this flight was one indicated
by Providence. They at length arrived on the way that led to the desert,
passed the boundaries of the land of Palestine, and wandered then, quietly
on, until they appeared but moving specks on the wide expanse of the
sands. Joseph and Mary cared tenderly for the Infant Jesus on their
journey. He was the object of their continual love. Only scanty provisions
had they taken with them, and water was scarce in such a region. At last
they came to the shores of the Red Sea, and saw the waters that rolled
between their own country and their destination. The Holy Family remained
several years in Egypt, until the cruel tyrant, Herod, had died.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Eleventh Day.


The angel of the Lord again came to Joseph, and bade him take the Child
and its Mother and return to the land of Israel, for those who had sought
after His life were dead. Nobody took much notice of their departure; the
Holy Family were too insignificant from a human point of view to trouble
any one. They made the journey back again through the desert with the same
difficulties besetting the way, until at length their eyes fell on the
hills of their own country: that land which God had chosen for His people.
They would gladly have entered Jerusalem on their way to Nazareth, but
Archelaus, the son of Herod, was reigning there, and Joseph considered it
prudent to avoid that city. No doubt he had recourse to prayer for
enlightenment what to do, and had received a response from heaven that he
should continue without delay his journey to Galilee; then their
journeyings were to be at an end, and they could live peaceably and
without fear in Nazareth, a home chosen by God for the sojourn of His
divine Son for nearly thirty years.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Twelfth Day.


In this sorrow of the Blessed Virgin, her flight into Egypt, we should
call to our mind first of all, the poverty and destitution of the Holy
Family in their exile. We would not be her devout and loving children, nor
would we be followers of the Lord, unless we showed a sympathy for the
sufferings endured during this event of Our Lord's life; unless we
impressed them on our minds by pious meditation. This poverty which the
Blessed Virgin endured was a part of her sorrows, and we, her children,
will not forget what she must have felt for Our Lord in these reduced
circumstances. Think of the hot winds of the desert, and the thirst they
could not quench when, weary and footsore, they travelled on through that
sandy waste. Another great concern of Mary's was, that the sins of mankind
had deprived God of His glory in the incarnation of His divine Son. Good
souls feel this very much, that God is not known and honored as He ought
to be; still there is no comparison between the feelings of the saints and
that of the Blessed Virgin. She lived a divine life, and was intimately
concerned in the providence of God, and so felt the ingratitude of man all
the more.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Thirteenth Day.


What lesson may we draw from this second sorrow of Mary in Egypt? An
important one is this, that sufferings and trials, if they come from God,
are far better for us than great consolations. To be well convinced of
this truth we must be thoroughly imbued with a spirit of faith. Even pious
people rebel when they think they suffer without having deserved it. How
many, instead of profiting by tribulations, become almost blasphemous in
their murmuring against God! We may be sure that the little troubles sent
us by God, rightly endured, are better for our spiritual welfare than
hours of prayer in which the feeling of consolation has a prominent part;
who knows whether this luxury which our souls enjoy is not the object that
we look for, without regard to our real good or the glory of God?

We also learn from the flight into Egypt that we must not question the
designs of Providence in our sufferings. Would we find it amiss if God had
worked miracles so that the Holy Family might at least have comfort? But
no, He seemed to afflict them without mercy.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Fourteenth Day.


The third sorrow that our blessed Mother endured was the loss of the Child
Jesus for three days. According to the Law, the Jews living in the
neighborhood of the holy city had to make a pilgrimage three times a year,
in order to celebrate the great feasts. They had to go on the feast of the
Pasch, which was instituted to commemorate the deliverance from the
bondage of Egypt; the second feast was that of the weeks, corresponding to
our Pentecost, and the third feast was the feast of the tabernacles, where
the devout of the nation thanked God for all the mercies shown them during
the year. It was at one of these feasts of the Passover, or Pasch, that
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph journeyed to Jerusalem. The Pasch must have been a
feast of peculiar significance to the members of the Holy Family, for they
knew what it really meant to them. There was to come a Pasch at which the
principal actor of the feast would be Jesus, Our Lord. He certainly had
that last Passover before His mind, and no doubt St. Joseph was also
informed of the future. Mary, certainly, could not be ignorant of that
great event in the future life of her divine Son.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Fifteenth Day.


As they journeyed on to Jerusalem, that future Passover of the sorrowful
Passion must have been pictured vividly in their minds. They saw the boy
of twelve years at their side, and they loved the Saviour of mankind with
a sincere, adoring love; more and more did they love their good Jesus, Who
was already making a sacrifice of Himself to His heavenly Father. They
remained during the days of the feast in the neighborhood of the Temple,
fulfilling the duties of their religion; and when the time came for their
departure, Mary and Joseph travelled separately, Joseph with the men and
Mary with the women. Mary thought that Jesus was with Joseph, and Joseph
thought that He was with Mary. They journeyed a whole day without being
aware of His absence; but when evening came and they, on inquiry, found
that the Child was not with them, they were overwhelmed with grief. They
returned to Jerusalem, and for three days sought Him through the city; at
length, on the third day, they went to the Temple, and there they found
the divine Child, sitting among the doctors, as the Scriptures say,
teaching them, and asking them questions.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Sixteenth Day.


During the days of His sojourn in Jerusalem, what was the occupation of
the Lord? He prayed long and fervently in that Temple, in that Holy of
holies, in that house which His Father had chosen as His dwelling-place on
earth. Our Lord's whole occupation was prayer. He prayed for the people of
God, that they might acknowledge Him as the Redeemer of mankind. The
doctors of the Law were there, picturing to themselves and to their
audience the greatness of the coming Messias, from the very Scriptures
which described His humiliations and modesty. Did Our Lord set them right
by making them explain the discrepancies which they could not help
noticing in the prophecies? The modesty of the Lord won all hearts, and so
His time passed in the service of God. Mary and Joseph ran with joy to
their beloved Son, and the Mother, embracing Him, remonstrated with Him,
saying, "Son, why hast Thou done so to us? Behold, Thy father and I have
sought Thee, sorrowing." Then He answered, "Did you not know that I must
be about My Father's business?" He then went home to Nazareth with them,
there to continue to do the will of His Father.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Seventeenth Day.


The sorrow of this event consisted mainly in the fact that Mary and Joseph
had lost, perhaps through their own fault, the Child Jesus. They did not
know whether it would be according to divine Providence that He would ever
return to them; they thought that perhaps He had gone to the desert, as
had St. John. This separation caused Mary terrible agony. It shows us how
hard it is to lose Jesus, Our Lord, because He is absolutely necessary to
us. By sin we lose Jesus; by love we regain Him, and the danger that we
may again lose Him is enough to make us feel very sad. Mary's great
suffering in this separation makes us understand the magnitude of the evil
of losing Jesus. But how little do we feel that separation, especially
when it is caused by our sins! It is always our own fault when Jesus goes
away from us. He would not leave us, only that we force Him from us, and
the means we use to conquer God, to make Him capitulate, is sin. To bring
Him back again we must be active in our search, regret the evil we have
done, and weep tears of real sorrow. Thus we invite our friend Jesus back
again into our soul.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Eighteenth Day.


Let us now consider the fourth sword of sorrow which pierced the heart of
Mary. No wonder we venerate in Mary a goodness of heart so great. We have
seen how this noble heart has been moved by the contemplation of the
future sorrows of her Son; how she was so intimately united with Him, that
she suffered for our sake as He did. And we know that Our Lord suffered
and died for no other cause than our redemption. In the fourth sorrow we
come closer to the Passion. We are transferred to the time when Jesus,
after the Last Supper, was apprehended by the cohort, judged by Pilate,
and delivered over to the Jews for crucifixion. The cross was laid on His
bleeding shoulders, and, crushed under its weight, He painfully makes His
way towards Calvary in company, or rather in a procession of curiosity-
seekers, of friends and of foes; the object of derision to some, of pity
to others. On His journey He meets His holy Mother. The cruel soldiers
allow the meeting, and a temporary rest. A painful scene takes place
between the Mother, and the Son Who is being led to execution.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Nineteenth Day.


Mary enjoyed the wonderful grace of being intimately united with Our Lord
in His sufferings. She was present in spirit when Jesus was in the agony
in the Garden of Gethsemani. She knew of the betrayal of Judas; she felt
the ingratitude of that apostle, and the pain it gave the good Master.
Mary sympathized with Jesus when He was scourged and cruelly treated the
night of His Passion. She could count the strokes of the scourges; she saw
the soldiers crown Him with thorns and strike Him in the face. She knew
that Our Lord was placed before the people that they might look on His
miserable condition, and feel compassion for Him; and she heard the voice
of Pilate, "Behold the man!" She heard the mob demand His death, not
satisfied by the tortures inflicted upon Him. Into the depths of her soul
went the cry, "Crucify Him, crucify Him! His blood be upon us, and upon
our children." St. John, the beloved disciple, came at last to the Blessed
Virgin, and brought the news of the condemnation of the Lord and of His
immediate crucifixion; they went out to meet Him in His painful journey to
Calvary.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Twentieth Day.


We have seen how sufferings of the Lord were communicated to Mary. Mary's
tears are mingled with His. Have we no share in them? Are we not to think
of them, and feel them? We have been the cause of Mary's sufferings,
because being sinners we brought about the death of Jesus Christ. Should
we not then, when we have recognized this fact, make the contemplation a
source of shame, repentance, and sorrow? We have been the cause of this
grief to Mary, and certainly we should, at least, have a devotion to her
sorrowful heart. How can we do this better than by performing all our
daily actions for the greater glory of God? Every day is a step nearer
eternity, and every day we should meet Jesus, and work with Him. When we
are in doubt and perplexity Jesus approaches us of His own accord, as He
did the disciples on their way to Emmaus. What crosses shall we meet on
our way each day? We know not. But this we know, that when we meet Jesus,
we will meet our cross, for He is bearing His. How many meet the Lord, but
turn away from Him when they see Him in such a pitiable condition? They
would rather be with Him in His joy than in His sorrow.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Twenty-first Day.


The world is a mystery. Life, death, time, good, evil and miseries, are
mysteries to us. The crucifix is the solution of them all. It is a
consoling contemplation when we are in trouble. When we have sinned it
brings tears of repentance to our eyes, and gives us the hope of
salvation; it is a source of love; it is a light in darkness; it is a
solemn exhortation without words. O blessed cross, cause of the fifth
sorrow to Mary! help us to have a joy in the cross in this life, that we
may be led by it to a happy eternity. The way of the cross is now ended;
the summit of Mount Calvary is reached about midday. The city of David is
close by and the crown of glory of this city is now to be taken away. But
the life of Christ is to crown it by its end, making it a still holier
city than it ever has been. The soldiers tear the garments off the body of
Jesus, and prepare for the execution by nailing Him to the cross. Mary
hears the strokes of the hammer as the nails are driven through His hands
and feet into the wood. Every stroke is a dreadful wound inflicted on her
sorrowing heart; who should feel it more than this Mother witnessing the
execution of her Son?

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Twenty-second Day.


The first hour of the three during which the Lord hung on the cross was
passed in silent endurance; in prayer, in offering the sacrifice of His
life for all mankind. Then darkness begins to gather. Mary approaches the
cross, and stands near the suffering Saviour. The executioners mock Him,
they cast lots for His garments; their cruel words and their coarse jokes
fall on Mary's ears and fill her soul with pain. Mary was to see and feel
everything, as well as the Lord. The whole hour passed, and Jesus was
silent; the second hour began its martyrdom and we hear the voice of
Christ, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," a prayer
which soothed the heart of Mary, for it was the voice of mercy. The third
hour Jesus began to grow weaker; the loss of blood produced a great
thirst, and He cried out, "I thirst." And Mary knew that Jesus thirsted
for souls; and that she could help this thirst by her prayers. Thus during
those three hours Mary stood beneath the cross; it was the fifth sword of
sorrow that pierced her soul.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Twenty-third Day.


At this time Mary became our Mother, for Jesus recommended us to her in
the person of St. John; it was His last will and testament; it was the end
of thirty years' communication between Mother and Son. Mary, like Jesus,
had at heart the salvation of mankind, and now she feels authorized to
have an interest in all humanity. She takes all under her protection; new
sources of inexhaustible love were opened in her heart. Our Lord gave her
the grace to love humankind as He loved them. Another circumstance to be
considered in the sword of sorrow which Mary endured beneath the cross was
her silence. She did not faint, nor cry out in despair. She was perfectly
resigned to the will of God. What God demanded of her she performed
without a murmur, and so she stood at her sorrowful post, determined to do
His holy will as she had done it all her life; the more God asked of her,
the more she was willing to give.

There is a great lesson in this sorrow of Mary: that we must learn how to
bear our crosses in this life. We must not throw them away; we must not
come down from Calvary until we are crucified, and then we and the cross
are inseparable. Calvary is a place where much impatience is manifested;
many go up well enough, and carry their cross with perseverance, but when
it comes to lie down on that cross, and be nailed to it, they go away
again, forgetting their duty, though it was duty that brought them that
far; they are only half-crucified souls. We do not rob them of the merit
of what they have done, but they might have done more. They have lost
their courage because they did not observe the silence that Jesus
preserved in His crucifixion; they were too much distracted; silence is
the atmosphere of the cross. We shall contemplate two individuals on
Calvary: Jesus and Mary. They teach us how to die. Jesus would certainly
have spared His Mother the scenes of His sufferings unless it were good
for her to witness them. She is to be with Jesus in His hour of death; she
is also to be with us in our last hour. Then we too will thirst, and our
soul will yearn for strength, which we will draw from the last sacraments
and from Mary's presence.

Twenty-fifth Day.


We can never understand the crucifixion unless we study it under Mary's
guidance, because she is part of it and it cannot be represented without
her. Oh, let us have a filial pity for her in her sorrows; let us feel a
sympathy for her, especially as she stands beneath the cross. Let us pray
to this sorrowful Mother, and imitate her in the very important lesson
there taught: that is, to pray for the poor departing souls. Every moment,
throughout the world, several souls pass from this life; it is their last
opportunity to make their peace with God. Let us have the devotion, which
is so charitable, to pray for the departing souls and recommend them to
the mercy of God. If our prayers may be effective for a special grace in
their regard, why should we not pray with fervor and for the love of God?
Send Mary to them; she is continually saving souls. We also should be
zealous to save them by frequently praying to God for this intention.

Twenty-sixth Day.


The sixth sorrow in the life of the Blessed Virgin was the taking down of
Our Lord from the cross. We read in the Scriptures, "They shall look upon
Him Whom they have pierced." Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus boldly, as
is said, went to Pilate, and demanded the body of Christ, that they might
give Him a decent burial. They drew the nails from the wounds of the hands
and feet of Our Lord, and respectfully took Him down from the cross and
placed Him in the arms of Mary. With great respect did these men and their
servants approach the cross and handle the body. Who can describe their
feelings during the pious work in which they were engaged? It was like the
respect and adoration we show to the Blessed Sacrament. Each instrument of
the Passion, still moist with the blood of Jesus, was laid near the
sorrowful Mother, who kissed them and preserved them. Who had a better
right to them? They were the first and holiest relics which the Church
venerated. Now the body has been lowered far enough, that St. John may let
His head rest on his shoulder. Mary knelt, and stretching out her arms she
received the precious weight of His body on her breast. At last she held
Him again, Whom as an Infant she had fondled in her arms! O Mary, now thou
lookest upon the beautiful but disfigured face of thy Jesus!

We must admire in Mary her wonderful steadfastness in her terrible
sorrows. She might have allowed herself to be so overwhelmed with grief
and despair that she would break out into shrieks and lamentations to
relieve her heart; but she was a silent, kind, sweet sufferer. The saints
have always loved the Passion of Our Lord, and have become familiar with
it. Mary was familiar with it; she had suffered just this very torture,
long before receiving the body of her beloved Son in her arms after the
crucifixion. She knew it was the will of God, and that was the only thing
she regarded. She was resigned to its operations. We too must think of the
Passion of Our Lord, and meditate upon it until we grow as familiar with
it, and love it, as did the saints. Why should we do so? Because we have
sinned, and by sin have caused all these sufferings to Our Lord and to His
blessed Mother, Mary. She was innocent of the sufferings of her Son; she
had never committed a fault. We, who are guilty of sin, ought to do
penance, ought to suffer, and be resigned to both.

Prayer.

Twenty-eighth Day.


The burial of Our Lord was the source of the seventh sorrow of Mary. When
the tomb had been prepared, the sheets spread out, and the ointments
placed, Joseph, Nicodemus, John, Magdalen, and Mary, the Mother, in the
depth of the night wended their way slowly from the height of Calvary, to
the burial place of Joseph, which was just outside the walls of the city.
Everything at the burial proceeded with great care and caution and in
silence, the scene lit up by the dim light of a solitary torch. There lay
the body, pale in death; the eyes closed, the lips set. All bent down in
adoration before that adorable body. Joseph, then, with the help of the
others, rolled the stone to the mouth of the tomb, and silently went to
the city. Mary and John again visited the place of crucifixion, and
gathered up the nails and crown of thorns; they also, that Friday night,
went into the city of Jerusalem. The guard of soldiers sent by Pilate were
already at the tomb, and sealed the stone so that the least interference
might be detected.

Twenty-ninth Day.


What was particularly sorrowful, in this seventh affliction, was the great
sense of desertion that Mary felt, as if left by God; her good and
adorable Son gone from her sight and buried. The days of the Passion, the
death and the burial, must have so exhausted the life of the good Virgin
that now she was near giving up the spirit. Every suffering that she had
to endure seemed to culminate in this supreme moment. It is the last sword
of Simeon's prophecy. No one can describe the sufferings of Mary, and no
one can describe the sanctity with which she bore up in all these trials.
But, O Simeon, thou didst assert that having seen the Lord, thou wert now
ready to leave this world. But this last sorrow did not announce the end
to Mary; she was to suffer on for years. There seems to be nothing human
or frail in Mary's sufferings. Her character grows upon us, in nobility
most exalted, and in patience never wavering. Man shows his feebleness at
some time, but Mary seemed to grow stronger, purer, and more beautiful.

Prayer.

O Heart of Mary, I offer, etc., etc.



Thirtieth Day.


What lessons are we to learn from this seventh sorrow of Mary, the
culmination of all her troubles and trials? One is that we should love God
and be faithful to Him, with a more unselfish attachment. Mary left the
tomb in which Our Lord was hidden from her sight without a murmur,
resigned to the will of God. She might have persuaded herself that she
should remain there, but God desired it otherwise, and she departed from
the place which held her all. It is hard, but true, that God's will must
be done in everything. Another lesson from the contemplation of the sorrow
caused by the separation from Our Lord was the bitterness of the
separation. Oh, how bitter it is to be away from Jesus! Is there anything
to make up for that loss? Terrible is the darkness of the hour when Christ
is absent. It is a hell upon earth. And thus we have made a history of the
life of Mary, and have followed her through her wearisome pain, until now
we leave her ripe for heaven. The time has come in which God will call her
to an eternity of honor and glory.

OCTOBER. THE ANGELS.


Both in the Old and in the New Testaments the Holy Scriptures teach us
that the angels exist and protect us: many examples are cited and facts
related, from which we may conclude that this is so. True, we do not see
the angels, and rare are the actual manifestations of their power, or
their existence; hence some people deny that order of spirits.

But by a merciful dispensation of divine Providence, we know that the
angels are active among us, that they shield us from evil, and draw
heavenly favors upon us. They are ever ready to serve God; there are also
spirits who care for each individual on earth--guardian angels.

Suarez is of opinion that Our Lord, in His adorable humanity, had a number
of angels to wait on Him. Our guardian angel does his work not less
effectively, for Our Lord tells us to be in dread of scandalizing a child,
because of his angel who is always at his side.

At the time of the birth of Our Lord a multitude of the heavenly choir
sang, "Glory to God on high, and peace to men of good-will." During this
month we celebrate the feast of the angel guardian; it has been considered
so important that the whole month is set aside to the devotion of the
angels. The Church encourages us in this devotion, for in the breviary she
has authorized a votive office in honor of these heavenly spirits, on
every Monday when there is no special festival to be celebrated, so that
we may be continually reminded of the great truth that our guardian angel
is always at our side.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


The name angel means a messenger; this name is given to these spirits
because they have been used by almighty God for that duty; they have been
sent by God to disclose His will to man. God could, of course, do His will
by His own power. He needs no angel, but for that matter He needs no
creature. Still, in His infinite kindness, He called rational creatures
into existence, and has given them a most honorable employment. Their
ordinary work is like what our own will be, or like that of the saints now
in heaven: "to see, love, bless, and enjoy God forever by a blessed
immortality." Penetrate, then, in your mind, the eternity of time, when
God in His love created pure rational creatures, who had a spirit like His
own, intelligence unencumbered with a body, and having no necessities. He
placed them near His throne in heaven, and now they announce in their
celestial adornments the omnipotence, love, and wisdom of their almighty
Creator. They sing perpetually of the sanctity of God, and render Him
glory. "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of armies." Hence the Council of
Lateran teaches authoritatively, "God created together, at the beginning
of time, out of nothing, both classes of creatures, spiritual and
corporal, the angelic and material, and then the human."

Prayer.

O angel of God, my guardian dear,
To whom His love commits me here.
Ever this day be at my side,
To light, to guard, to rule, and guide.



Second Day.


God, says the great preacher Bossuet, wished to create spirits like
Himself, pure and immaterial, living by intelligence and love. Spirits
that would know and love Him as He knows Himself and loves Himself, and
who would be happy in simply knowing and loving this first great Being.
For that very reason they bear on their natures a divine character, after
God's image and likeness. O God, who can doubt that Thou could create
spirits without a body? or is there need of a body that one might
understand, love and be happy? Thou, O God, Who art Thyself a pure spirit,
art Thou not incorporal and immaterial? Are not intelligence and love
spiritual and immaterial operations, which can be exercised without a
body? The creation of the angels, then, was a manifestation of God's
omnipotence, as it is also omnipotence to call human individuals into
existence, and to give them knowledge, so that they can serve and glorify
God.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Third Day.


The angels are part of the universal creation outside of God, and were
created in the beginning of time. St. Thomas, the great theologian, says
"The angels are a part of the universal creation, and form a regular grade
in that creation." Now no part can be perfect when separated from its
belongings, and we are sure God's works are perfect; but the angelic world
would have stood by itself, separated and isolated from the rest of
creation, if it had been made before the sensible world. The number of
angels is very great. God did not stint Himself in giving lavishly of His
benefits. These pure spirits inhabit space, and move about in choirs of
immense numbers. "Thousands upon thousands ministered to Him, and ten
thousand times a hundred thousand stood before Him."--Dan. vii. 10. These
figures certainly point to an almost infinite number. Count if you can the
sands on the seashore, the stars in the firmament, and when you think you
have reached a definite calculation, you are far below the real existing
number. God pours out lavishly the abundance of His omnipotence and love.
Prodigality is a characteristic of all the divine works. We cannot
meditate on the countless multitude of the angels without astonishment.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


God has not made all the angels alike. We know from the Scriptures that
there are distinctions which we do not exactly understand. Some are
angels, others archangels, others dominations, virtues, etc. St. Jerome
writes, "Among the invisible creatures there is a manifold and an
indefinite diversity." It is natural to suppose that not only did God
exert His omnipotence in the production of myriads of beautiful spirits,
not only did He make them the most perfect of their kind for the purpose
for which they were intended, but that He also diversified them. God
almighty not only gave these intellectual beings existence, but He also
gave them a knowledge by which, with their own intelligence, they could
rise to a most exalted contemplation of His infinity. What glory do not
these intelligent beings bring to God's throne! What beautiful homage do
they not pour forth in His presence! What exultation there must be in
their study of God, constantly discovering something new and unnoticed,
going deeper and deeper into the depths of the wonders of God! Let us also
rejoice with the angels, and love to study the adorable perfections of
God: let us be fond of reading of and hearing about God.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


The angels speak to one another, and their conversation is concerning holy
things. The Scriptures tell us that the seraphim cry "one to another,
Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts."--Isa. vi. 3. The angels also
speak to God in prayer and adoration; they praise His power, they extol
His majesty, they beseech His clemency, they consult His wisdom. And they
can also speak to men, as the archangel Gabriel did to Mary. Faber tells
us, in wonderful words, what he thought of the power of the angels: "Cast
your eye over that outspread ocean, whose shores lie so faintly and far
off in the almost infinite distance. It gleams like restless silver,
quivering with life, and yet such multitudinous life! It flashes the light
with intolerable magnificence. Its unity is numberless, its life is purest
light. Into the bosom of its vastness the glory of God shines down, and
the universe is illuminated with its refulgence. It is an ocean of life.
Who can count the sum of being that is there? Who but God can fathom its
unsearchable caverns? What created eye but is dazzled with the blazing
splendor of its capacious surface? Grand storms of voiceless praise hang
over it forever, whose very silence thrills the soul of the human saints."

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Sixth Day.


The power of the angels is immense. The Scriptures tell us that they
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, by raining fire and brimstone upon them.
They destroyed the army of Sennacherib, when every soldier felt the keen
edge of the angel's sword; they strangled the first-born of the Egyptian
people in one night. The devil, by permission from God, raised storms that
tore down the houses in which Job's sons and daughters were feasting,
burying all in the ruins. He afflicted Job with a most filthy disease, and
robbed him of all his possessions to try to make him revolt against God.
When Our Lord freed those who were possessed by the devil, the evil spirit
asked to be permitted to enter a herd of swine, and when it had received
the permission the swine rushed headlong down the hill into the sea and
were destroyed. If then, the power of these spirits is so great for evil,
the angels are more powerful for good. We will be friends with our good
angels whom God has sent to perform favors for us--favors both temporal and
spiritual; we will hate the devil, and with the help of God's grace resist
his power.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


The angelic world is most beautiful. St. Augustine says in his "City of
God," "The angelic world in its natural dignity surpasses all other things
the Lord has made. Consider this intelligence by which they know so many
things so perfectly, the great power by which they can do good to their
fellow-creatures, the brightness of those wonderful spirits shining like
the glorious luminaries of our universe, the wonderful gifts which
almighty God furnished them, and we have a picture of such harmonious
glory that all the beauty of the world, all the magnificent actions of the
human kind, dwindle into insignificance before this great creation of
angelic spirits." In Ezechiel we read of the admirable beauty of the devil
that had fallen: "Thou wast the seal of resemblance, full of wisdom, and
perfect in beauty. Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of God:
every precious stone was thy covering ... gold the work of thy beauty: ...
Thou wast a cherub stretching out thy wings and covering, and I set thee
in the holy mountain of God, thou hast walked in the midst of the stones
of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation, until
iniquity was found in thee."--Ezech. 12-15. And Isaias the prophet
exclaimed with regret at the fall of Lucifer, "How art thou fallen from
heaven, O Lucifer, who didst arise as the morning."

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Eighth Day.


Faber speaks in the following terms of the rational creatures of God,
including men and angels: "God became a King by becoming a Creator. Thus
He gained an empire over which His insatiable love might rule." Nature is
very beautiful, whether we think of angelic or human nature. Created
nature is a shadow of the uncreated nature, so real and so bright that we
cannot think of it without exceeding reverence. Yet God created neither
men nor angels in a state of nature. This is, to my mind, the most
wonderful and most suggestive thing which we know about God. He would have
no reasonable nature, even from the very first, which should not be
partaker of His divine nature. This is the very meaning of the state of
grace. He would not have it to breathe for one instant in a merely natural
way. The very act of creation was full of fondness, of paternal jealousy.
O that majesty of God, which seems clothed with such wonderful
tranquillity in the eternity before the creation!

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Ninth day.


Not only do the angels praise almighty God, pray to Him, and converse with
Him, but they do it much more effectually than we do because of their
greater purity, and because they know God better than we do. Hence the
question might be asked, what do the angels know of God, and of religion
as it is among us? The answer is that they know what we know, and much
more; still there are some things too great because too infinite, even for
the intelligence of angels. Can the angels understand God? No, indeed. God
is infinite, and no finite mind can comprehend Him. They know that God is
one, because even we, in our inferior intelligence, know that there can be
but one God; they know too, that there are three divine persons, but it
will ever remain a mystery to them as well as to us, because it is a truth
of such infinite dimensions; but they understand it much more distinctly
than we do. It is probable that the angels knew the mystery of the
incarnation by divine revelation, and they believed in it. St. Thomas and
other theologians are of opinion that the bad angels fell because they
would not submit to the belief in the hypostatic union. It was therefore
fitting, for the glory and honor of the Son of God, Who was to be made
flesh, that the angels should know this mystery.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Tenth Day.


Father Faber speaks thus of their knowledge of the precious blood during
their term of probation: "The angels wonder more than man at the goodness
of God in sending us His divine Son to die for us, because they understand
it better. From the very first He invited the angels to adore it. He made
their adoration a double exercise of humility--of humility towards Himself,
and of humility towards us, their fellow-creatures. It was the test to
which He put their loyalty. He showed them His beloved Son, the Second
Person of the Blessed Trinity, in His sacred humanity, united to a nature
lower than theirs, and in that lower nature crowned their King and Head,
to be worshipped by them with absolute and unconditional adoration. The
Son of a human Mother was to be their head, and that daughter of Eve to be
herself their Queen. He showed them in that blood the source of all their
graces." The precious blood was as the dew of the whole kingdom of the
angels. Well, then, may the angels claim to sing the song of the Lamb: to
Whose outpoured human life they also owed so much.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Eleventh Day.


The angels merited the crown of a happy eternity in union with God: "For
he also, that striveth for the mastery, is not crowned except he striveth
lawfully."--Tim. ii. 5. Such is the law of God, not only for men but for
angels also. Pope Gelasius says, "That the angels were so constituted as
to merit an increase of eternal glory, is sufficiently indicated by the
fact that they stood in need of nothing more, that none of them could have
committed evil." And St. Prosper says of their trial, "It was the action
of the will of the holy angels, that while their companions with their own
free will rebelled, they themselves remained faithful in the dignity
wherein God had placed them; and hence it came to pass by a divine and
most just judgment, that what was only up to that a holy desire of
remaining with God, became thereafter a voluntary and a most blessed
necessity of remaining with Him forever." We too should strive continually
to merit our crown in heaven; we are placed on trial here on this earth, a
place of pilgrimage, and we should remain faithful to the conditions of
that trial until our journey is over.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twelfth Day.


Almighty God loved His angels, and made them His friends and favorites.
The Blessed Virgin is placed above them all, as the Church on the day of
her assumption proclaims: "She is exalted above the choirs of angels in
the heavenly kingdom." Here we have to adore the liberality of almighty
God, and the mysterious and adorable way in which He distributes His
gifts. He fashions the angels in a natural order, and endows them with
greater natural perfections than others. Next He raises them in the first
instant of creation to the supernatural order by the gift of sanctifying
grace. Then comes the time of probation, and He confirms the good forever
in glory, bestows on them the beatific vision, happiness, enlightenment,
and splendor according to their acts, but still more in proportion to the
natural powers, dignity, and excellence of His own divine hand. Here
indeed is the potter and the potter's clay spoken of by St. Paul. To man
God acts differently: "But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen
that He may confound the wise: and the weak things of the world hath God
chosen, that He may confound the strong ... that no flesh should glory in
His sight."--2 Cor. i. 27-29.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Thirteenth Day.


Oh, what a glory, what a happiness and consolation, were granted to the
angels when they had done the will of God! God received His faithful
followers with goodness and love, and introduced them into His place of
glory, and there He manifested Himself to them and will do so for all
eternity. And so the beautiful life of the angels in heaven may furnish us
with ample materials for meditation. Our Lord calls our attention to them
when He bids us pray that we may do His will on earth, as do the angels in
heaven. Faber says, "Grace is a better portion than nature for loving God;
by grace God can communicate Himself to us supernaturally, by it He gets
more love from us, and makes us more able to love Him. O that we had the
hearts to know the meaning of this! Surely His love of us should be our
measure of love for Him. Well might St. Francis run about the woods crying
out, 'Oh, God is not known! God is not loved!' " The angels will ever
remain in heaven, loving and honoring God, in supreme happiness, in the
infinite light of God Himself. Let us also, as some saints have done,
offer to God the love of the first choir of seraphim in reparation for all
the outrages going on in the world.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Fourteenth Day.


We have seen the great reward the good angels received for remaining
faithful to God. What did the bad angels lose by their infidelity? It was
to them a final impenitence, which means the loss of the power of ever
turning to God; which will in its turn be an eternal regret at the loss of
God. Listen to the sentence of the reprobate: "Depart from Me, ye
accursed, into everlasting flames, which was prepared for Satan and his
angels." In Holy Scripture we often read of the worm that gnaws and dies
not; by this is meant the continual anguish and grief of a soul which has
lost God--a passionate regret that will seize on it, and never leave it,
because the loss is an everlasting one. God spoke, and the depths of hell
sprang into existence. Bossuet says that the curse of God against the
reprobate contains within itself an imprecation against the unhappy soul,
which tears out from the minutest fibres of its being all the capacity it
once had to receive enjoyment from bliss, as well as the power to perform
the least good action capable of meriting any mercy. This example of the
fall of the angels should strike terror into our hearts, and should incite
us to pray to the good angels, especially to our guardian angel, so that
we may ever remain faithful to the service of God.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Fifteenth Day.


It is an inexhaustible subject, the marvels which theology teaches of the
holy angels; who can properly describe the power of these pure spirits,
the greatness of their intelligence, the fire of their holy love? Their
graces, their powers, their gifts, their operations, their works, are so
diversified that it is with difficulty the mind of man can conceive them
and intelligibly speak of them. In several places in the Scriptures we
read of the choirs of angels, archangels, principalities, powers, virtues,
dominations, thrones, cherubim, seraphim. Dionysius teaches that there are
three orders of angels--three superior, three inferior and three middle:
the superior, cherubim, seraphim, and thrones; the middle, dominations,
principalities, and powers; the inferior, virtues, archangels and angels.
These names are given to them, not for their own sake but for ours; and
the individual orders are called from the gifts of grace which they
possess. O that we realized that our future eternity is to be with the
angels in heaven; that our glory depends on our life here; greater glory
for greater work! We should strive to deserve a great place in heaven for
the glory of God.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Sixteenth Day.


The angels are engaged in praising and loving God; what this really
includes who can tell?--or it means a variety of occupation and the
greatest liberty of using their free will for the glory of God. The angels
occupy themselves according to the meaning of their names. God, in His
relations to Himself, is represented by seraphim, cherubim and
thrones--angels that are devoted to His service particularly; who rejoice
not so much in doing their own will, as they are happy in the close
association with the splendor of God in heaven. A seraph is a great, pure
angel, who shines and burns in honor of God. He represents the love of
God; that great love for His creatures which is forever active in our
behalf. The seraphs are put in the highest place, as created
representations of that wonderful attribute, the charity of God for
Himself. The cherubim are placed second; they represent knowledge and
wisdom: "He was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh
into this world." This is Jesus, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity,
represented by the cherubim. The thrones represent God in His majesty,
sitting on His throne of glory in heaven.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Seventeenth Day.


Thus we may say that the seraphim represents the Holy Ghost; the cherubim,
the Word, the Son of God; the thrones, the Father. These choirs of angels
are in the immediate presence of God. They are before His throne, and they
see Him day and night in His temple: "and He that sitteth on the throne
shall dwell over them." M. Olier says: "The seraphim proceed from God, as
flames proceed from a furnace, and their circle surround Him as with a
fiery blaze." The cherubim are the rays of the divine wisdom, and are, so
to say, the eyes of God, under which He seems to regard Himself, and all
the external world. The thrones are the image of His sanctity. This
hierarchy expresses the three great perfections which we adore in God,
namely: His love, His knowledge, and His holiness. These typify also those
beautiful operations of grace whereby God draws to Himself intelligent
beings; by detaching them from creatures and attaching them to Himself,
enlightening them interiorly by His heavenly wisdom, so that they freely
follow the guidance of God, and making His throne in their hearts, in
their affections, abides there forever.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Eighteenth Day.


Let us consider to-day the angels of the second choir. They are the
dominations, principalities and powers. Again their names are given to
them for the virtues they represent, and not from their angelic nature.
The three choirs of the first hierarchy were typical of the essential acts
of God. The three of the second represent the external acts of God. The
dominations represent the power of God. He is the absolute Lord of the
universe; He is the Creator, the Maker, and therefore the possessor of all
that is. The principalities govern the world, under God, and according to
His divine providence. "By Me kings reign, and lawgivers decree just
things." Hence the duty of this choir of angels is to praise God for the
wisdom displayed in His ruling and legislating of the external creation.
The angels of power put the laws of God into execution. They reward and
punish; they are the representatives of executive power. They praise God
in the power manifested in the carrying out of the laws impressed on the
material and spiritual world. Should we not learn from these angels to
praise the Almighty in all He has done?

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Nineteenth Day.


The third choir of the hierarchy of the angels are the virtues,
archangels, and angels. The virtues are the first of these, and represent
the acts of God towards individuals. Those works of God which surpass the
power of man, such as miracles, or inward movements of grace, are
performed by the virtues of the Most High; they hold an intermediate
station between heaven and earth. Archangels are the great messengers,
whom God has sent to His intelligent creation. The name is given because
the goodness and kindness of God have distinguished them from the myriads
of other angels, and given them an office, that of bearing to men the
words of God; they also carry the prayers of the faithful on earth, and
lay them before God's throne in heaven; and they are sent to conduct souls
to the portals of heavenly bliss. The archangels have the duty of
protecting the Church; those who occupy high positions in the Church or
State are said to be under the guidance of an archangel. In this manner
the higher grade of archangels represents the higher degree of providence
shown by God towards individuals. Let us unite ourselves with the choir of
the archangels and praise God in them--those glorious spirits, that have so
perfectly conveyed God's messages to men.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twentieth Day.


It is a belief which we may prove from the Scriptures, which is
corroborated by many facts in the history of the world, and by the belief
of ancient people, that God governs the world, even the natural world,
through the agency of spirits; to each of whom He was pleased to depute
certain offices. He made use of the good angels to maintain order in
general, to watch over empires, to protect men, to carry His blessings to
them, and to be the executives of His justice. Everywhere Scripture
recalls this wonderful ministry of the angels; and there is not an epoch
of time in which such a tradition did not exist. We read in the Gospel
that Our Lord Himself was tempted by the devil, the fallen angel. Our
blessed Lord teaches us that little children are dearer to Him than they
are to their own mothers, and He has appointed angels to be their
guardians. So great is a human soul in the eyes of God. We have to
struggle not alone against flesh and blood, but against principalities and
powers, against those who have dominion in this world, and against evil
spirits scattered in the air. But in this struggle we shall be assisted by
the good spirits, whom God commissions to look after His beloved
creatures.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twenty-first Day.


In the book of the Apocalypse, we read of the activity of the angels. We
see them coming from heaven to earth; they bring down from almighty God
orders for salvation as well as for punishment; hence the angels are
called ministering spirits, sent for the ministry of our salvation.
Especially may we conceive that in the service of the Church the angels
are particularly active--that there are angels who intervene in the
oblation, and bear it to the sublime altar of Jesus Christ, angels who are
called angels of prayer, and who present before God the petitions of the
faithful. St. Michael is the defender of the Church. The ancient Jewish
people were protected by St. Michael, also. Other nations had their
superior spirits, which are mentioned in the Scriptures as protectors; for
the prophet Daniel speaks of the prince of the Greeks, the prince of the
Persians, angels who preside spiritually and invisibly over these nations.
Are we not also important as a nation, in the designs of God? Whom has God
appointed over the affairs of our country? We know there is such a spirit;
let us pray to him even without knowing him, for we are sure that our
prayers will reach the one appointed by God to protect us.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twenty-second Day.


To each man an angel is appointed for his care: this we can prove from the
Scriptures. "Their angels in heaven always see the face of My Father Who
is in heaven."--Matt. xviii. 10. St. Paul says, "Are they not all
ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the
inheritance of salvation?"--Heb. i. 14. Fallen man needed some help, and
almighty God entrusted him to the care of the angels. Even God's power,
God's wisdom, and God's mercy demand it. First of all, the power of God
demanded that the angels should not only serve Him, but serve His glory in
His creatures. God's wisdom demanded that each human being coming into the
world should receive a guardian; for the devil has great power over us,
and we would not be able to battle against the devil or the flesh without
help. God desires to preserve His work: hence God's mercy moves Him in
favor of the fallen or those in danger of a fall, like unto a mother full
of tenderness for her children. God gave His only Son for the redemption
of mankind; precious, indeed, then, is this human soul, if worthy to be
purchased by the blood of the Lamb; certainly precious enough, too, to be
guarded with care by a superior intelligence.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twenty-third Day.


Not only the just, but also sinners, have guardian angels. Indeed it would
appear that sinners and infidels need them more, for the sinner is so
wayward, and yet God in His kindness wishes to bring him back to good
ways, and so the gentle persuasion of a guiding spirit is necessary. The
Scriptures do not limit the attendance of the guardian angels to those
only who are in a state of grace; therefore it is likely that even after
sin the ministering angel remains. While we are good we hardly need the
presence of a good spirit; it is when we have turned to evil that we need
that precious guide. The belief that a guardian angel attends us ought to
impress itself deeply on our minds; we are never alone, we are taken care
of by the ministers of God Our Father, and we have nothing to fear. Even
though the world has turned against us, and we are surrounded by trouble
on all sides, we are sure that this angel will bring comfort to us.
Children should be taught from their early childhood that a guardian angel
attends them; it will have a very good effect in shaping their lives.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twenty-fourth Day.


The guardian angels have certain duties to perform, and we can put them
down in this wise. First, the angel guardian defends us from all evil. He
can put thoughts into our minds which will put us on our guard against
sin. Second, the angels oppose the cunning of the devil, who wants to
destroy us. The devil argues in a very crafty manner, and unless we are
strengthened by the love and the goodness of God we would be led astray by
the devil's superior intelligence. But our guardian angel brings light to
the mind, and holds the soul in the desire of good. Third, they offer our
prayers to almighty God, as we read in the Apocalypse, "There was given to
[the angel] much incense, ... and the smoke of the incense of the prayers
of the saints, ascended up before God, from the hand of the angel." Our
angel intercedes for us with God with a personal and special interest, and
we, on account of our great sinfulness, need an angel to help us to obtain
grace and mercy from almighty God.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twenty-fifth Day.


We do most assuredly deserve punishment from God, because we do not behave
ourselves as we should; like a naughty child, who, notwithstanding good
advice and most tender interest, will go wrong, be obstinate and sulky.
The good mother chastises the child in the same manner the spirit of God
shows his disapprobation, in a gentle manner, for the angel of light would
not resort to force, as the demon does in his attacks. We ought to be glad
that we have a spirit of wisdom about us that will tell us of our sins;
that excites the qualms of conscience, and will give us no rest until we
make our peace with God. We often turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of the
good spirit; we trample our conscience under foot and abuse it, bring up
reasons to combat its correction: we argue with ourselves in obstinacy,
and being left alone, who will gain the victory? The devil and our evil
inclinations will gain the day assuredly. Docility to the interior voice
is a necessary quality for a good life; to listen to God and spiritual
influences ought to be, to say the least, the very natural consequence of
a rational soul, tending to God with all its power.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twenty-sixth Day.


The influence of the angels in bringing us to heaven should be marvellous
for that purpose. They have been assigned to our service, to bring our
wandering spirits back to God. What a glorious conquest when an angel can
snatch a soul from eternal perdition by his prayers and exertions! If the
devil is active to gain us, would it not be against reason that the good
angel would stand back and remain inactive? The last hours of a man, his
judgment, and entrance into heaven, are the moments of the great and final
duties of the guardian spirits; and if the soul be detained in purgatory,
then the duty of the angel will be to offer the prayers of friends,
relatives and of the Church to almighty God for the good of that soul. And
perhaps by the kind possibility of the mercy of God, the angel will
descend into the fires of purgatory and will speak consoling, comforting,
and encouraging words to the soul whose greatest torment is the separation
from God for a time, until its purgation is complete.

Prayer.

O angel of God. etc., etc.



Twenty-seventh Day.


St. Bonaventure has written extensively on the holy angels, and has
meditated on their ways. It was a useful practice to him and helped to
sanctify him. He gives us twelve effects consequent to the duty of taking
care of us, which these angel guardians manifest and perform. First, they
accuse of sin, as we read in Judges ii. 1. Second, they absolve from the
debt of sin by inspiring sorrow in the soul, and a firm purpose of
amendment. Third, they remove the obstacles that stand in the way of doing
good; for the angels strangled the first-born of the Egyptians, who
opposed the going away of the Israelites. Fourth, they drive away demons,
as is related in the twelfth chapter, of Tobias. Fifth, they teach us in
matters of religion. Sixth, they reveal the secrets of God to us. "Can I
hide from Abraham what I am about to do?"--Gen. xviii. 17. Seventh, they
console us. Eighth, they strengthen us in the way of God. Ninth, they
convey and bring back, as we read in Tobias, "I will conduct him thither
and bring him back to thee." Tenth, they overthrow our enemies.--Is.
xxxvii. Eleventh, they mitigate the violence of temptations. Twelfth, they
pray for us, and bear our prayers to God.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twenty-eighth Day.


During this month we have thought of the nature of the angels, and their
work for human kind; now let us reflect on what we ought to do in return
for these attentions. Ought we let them pass, accept them as a matter of
course, and pay no attention to them? Many do this. Yet we owe them
something--how much, is left almost to our own generosity. We certainly owe
them friendship; they are our friends, and are solicitous for our welfare.
If I have a friend that does a great deal for me, supplies my wants, and
satisfies every wish of mine, I am certainly proud of his friendship, and
I will seek every opportunity to be in his company. So should we treat our
truest friends--our guardian angels. We should also reverence the angels,
because they are greater beings than we are; they are the favorites and
friends of God. Then we must have a devotion to them. This devotion we are
endeavoring to practice during the month of October.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Twenty-ninth Day.


What goodness does not God evince in giving us angels to watch over us!
The princes of earth choose the most learned to train the heirs to the
crown; and God gives us guides full of wisdom, science, and purity. He has
deputed the princes of His court to watch over us. What high ideas we
should conceive of our dignity, then, and how we should realize that we
are called to great sanctity! Even a mother's love cannot equal the
angels', and when we go to heaven we will be astonished on reviewing their
services. St. Bernard exclaims, "O excess of goodness and love! O
admirable condescension! He has given His angels charge over us." The
great God of heaven and earth has sent those elevated dignitaries of His
heavenly court to watch over us, poor miserable sinners. Why does He do
this? What can be His object in so caring for us? It is to His goodness
alone we owe all. Let us prove ourselves grateful, then, to Him and to His
holy angels, and may we one day join them in their songs of praise and
gladness!

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Thirtieth Day.


St. Bernard teaches that we ought to honor and respect our angels on
account of their excellence; to love them for their care of us, and to
have recourse to them in all our necessities. However weak or miserable we
may be, or however terrible the dangers that surround us, we should not
fear under the protection of such guardians. There is no better way of
securing the protection of the angels than by avoiding all sin, but
particularly mortal sin; for when we are at enmity with God they are ready
to exterminate us at His command. But they will ever prove faithful
friends to the servants of God. How can the angels help loving and aiding
those whom they know are dear to God? Our guardian angels often ward off
accidents that would cut us off unprepared; after interceding for us to
prevent God from calling us out of life, they try to make us bring forth
worthy fruits of penance. O holy angels, I entreat you to extend your
special care to me during the rest of my life, that I may live in God's
friendship and die in His love.

Prayer.

O angel of God, etc., etc.



Thirty-first Day.


When the figure of this world shall have passed away, the angels will come
and call us to judgment; every human being will then rise again, and
hasten to the valley of Jehosaphat. The good will go to the right side,
the wicked to the left, the separation made by the angels. Then will the
Lord appear in the glory of heaven, surrounded by His angels, and the
judgment will take place. Happy shall we be if we are judged to be as pure
as the angels, and will ascend with them to paradise, ever to be
associated with them. Then will come our exceeding great reward; we shall
see God face to face for all eternity. We shall form choirs for the praise
of the Almighty, alternating with the angels. We shall know God, love Him,
rejoice in Him, and praise Him. Then, for the first time, we shall love
God above all things, our joy shall be without measure because we shall
have a particular joy for everything that is in God. We will praise God
with all our heart, with all our strength, with all our power, with all
our faculties. "Happy are they that live in Thy house, O Lord, for they
will praise Thee forever and ever." Here youth never grows old; here there
is life that knows no end, beauty that never fades, love that never cools,
joy that never ceases. Let us then, while on earth, lead the life of
angels, be as pure as they, as obedient to God's will as they, and pray to
them daily that they help us to this much-desired perfection.

Prayers To St. Michael, St. Gabriel, And St. Raphael.


Glorious St. Michael! prince of the heavenly host, protector of the
universal Church, defend us against all our enemies, visible and
invisible. Do not permit that we should ever fall under their tyranny.

St. Gabriel! thou who art justly called the strength of God, since thou
hast been chosen to announce to many the mystery of the incarnation, in
which the Almighty has displayed the power of His arms, make us know the
treasure contained in the person of the Son of God, and be our protector
with His august Mother.

perfections; that He has sanctified thee by His grace, and crowned thee
with glory, after having persevered in His service. May God be praised
forever for all He has done for thee! Be thou blessed for all the good
thou hast procured me and my companions. I abandon to thee my body, soul,
memory, understanding, will, inclination, and senses. Govern all, dispose
of all, purify, enlighten, perfect all. Beg Our Lord to shed upon me and
my companions His abundant benedictions; that, persevering until death in
His grace, we may deserve to possess Him eternally with thee in glory.
Amen.



Prayer To The Holy Angels During The Month Of October.


O pure and happy spirits, whom the Almighty selected to become the angels
and guardians of men! we most humbly prostrate ourselves before you, to
thank you for the charity and zeal with which you execute this commission.
Alas! how many pass a long life without ever thanking that invisible
friend to whom they a thousand times owe its preservation! O charitable
guardians of those souls for whom Christ died! O burning spirits, who
cannot but love those whom Jesus eternally loved, permit us to address you
in behalf of all those committed to your care, and to implore for them
all, in general, a grateful sense of your many favors, and the grace to
profit by your charitable assistance. O angels of those happy infants, who
are as yet without spot before God, preserve their innocence, we earnestly
conjure you. Angels of youth, who are exposed to so many dangers, conduct
them in safety to the bosom of God, as Tobias was conducted back to his
father. Angels of those who are employed in the instruction of youth,
animate them with your zeal and love; teach them to emulate your purity
and incessant view of God, that they may worthily and successfully co-
operate with the invisible guardians of their young charges. O angels of
the clergy, who have the eternal Gospel to preach, present their words,
their actions, and their intentions to God, and purify them in that fire
of love which consumes you. Angels of infidels, whom the true faith has
never enlightened, intercede for them; that, practising what they know,
they may at length discover the hidden secrets of the kingdom of God. O
angels of all those who, throughout the world, are deprived of religious
instruction, open for them some source of salvation; raise up some one to
break for them the bread of the Word. And you, O guardian angels of
sinners, charitable guides of those unhappy mortals, whose persistence in
sin would embitter even your unutterable joys were you not established in
the peace of God, oh, join us, we ardently beseech you, in imploring their
conversion. Angels of all those who at this moment struggle in the agonies
of death, strengthen, encourage and defend them against the attacks of
their infernal enemies. O faithful guides, holy spirits, ardent adorers of
the Divinity, guardian angels of all creatures! protect us all, teach us
to love, to pray, to combat on earth, and rather obtain for us instant
death than permit us to commit one mortal sin. Amen.





NOVEMBER. THE SOULS IN PURGATORY.


A truly Christian soul will, during this month, think with love of the
faithful departed. There is nothing more pleasing to God, or more
profitable to ourselves, than the practice of praying for the souls in
purgatory, that He may relieve their sufferings and speedily admit them to
His glory. We see our friends dropping from the ranks of the living, and
entering that state which is so mysterious. The Church tells us that we
can help them on their way to heaven by our prayers, if they have been
detained in purgatory to atone to God's justice for their transgressions.

St. Alphonsus says, "It is a duty, for Christian charity commands us to
relieve our neighbors who stand in need of our assistance; but who among
all our neighbors have so great need of our help as these holy prisoners,
deprived for a time of the sight of God?" Many indulgences, both plenary
and partial, are applicable to them; let us gain them, so that the mercy
of God may be moved in their favor. Let us also remember the poor souls
who have no one to pray for them. And in return these blessed souls will
not neglect to obtain for us many graces from God, particularly the grace
of eternal life.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


Often meditate on the sufferings of the souls in purgatory. The thought
will inspire you with the proper and holy fear of God's justice, which
requires expiation in purgatory for sins unatoned for in this life. It
will also move you to have compassion on the poor souls, and to relieve
them by your good works. The souls in purgatory endure dreadful
punishments; it is the opinion of theologians that they suffer the pains
of fire. They also suffer the pain of loss, which is more severe than that
of sense. You should ask yourselves: Shall we suffer these dreadful pains
in purgatory, or shall we escape them? Let us take warning from the
unhappy souls who are to be miserable for eternity, and cultivate a
salutary fear of God's justice and so avoid sin. Let the happiness of the
saints encourage us to lead virtuous lives, and confide in the mercy and
goodness of God. Standing between the eternity of happiness and the
eternity of misery, we must make our choice. Through God's grace and the
intercession of the Blessed Virgin and the members of the heavenly court,
let us resolve, in future, to avoid not only mortal but also venial sin.
Let us resolve also to atone for our past sins, and pay the debt which we
owe to God's justice, so that when our souls are separated from our bodies
we may go at once to enjoy God in heaven.

Prayer.

Release, O Lord, the souls of all the faithful departed from the bonds of
their sins; and by the assistance of Thy grace may they escape the
sentence of condemnation, and enjoy the bliss of eternal light. Amen.



Second Day.


We are told that few of those who save their souls, except children who
have not lost their baptismal innocence, go to heaven without passing
through purgatory. How many are surprised by death in venial sin! how many
who receive forgiveness for the guilt of mortal sin still owe some
temporal debt for it! how few leave this life without some stain on their
souls! Yet every stain must be wiped away, every farthing of the debt
paid, before the soul can leave the prison of purgatory. We have no time
to lose, death may be at our doors. Why not now use the means of avoiding
purgatory? Why do we count a suffering in the future which in the present
we would be in no way ready to accept, but would employ every effort to
escape? How soon must we leave this world never to return! How soon will
day and night have no meaning for us! Our bodies, mouldered into dust,
will come to life again only at the sound of the last trumpet, and then
only for judgment. Friends who love us, possessions on which we have set
our hearts, will be taken from us. We will leave as we came, alone. Why,
then, attach ourselves to those things in such a way as to bring upon us
the displeasure of God, and the sufferings which His displeasure entails?
Better far to live here with the thought of the bitterness which goes with
wrongdoing and a sense of security for the future, than thoughtlessly to
incur the punishment which is to be found in purgatory.

Prayer.

Release, O Lord, etc., etc.



Third Day.


The earth is only a vast cemetery. Our ancestors are mixed up with its
clay, whether they lie beneath the surface or have had their ashes
scattered to the four winds. How soon were they forgotten! Of all the
generations which have gone before us how few individuals are known! Of
some history tells the noble deeds, of others the dark ones. The really
wise and great men of every age are the virtuous, now the friends of God.
Their names come down to us in benediction. History may record the names
of the wicked, but their memory is held in execration. What matters it to
all those who are dead whether men speak of them or not? The one thing of
importance is how God has regarded their lives. We too will soon be
forgotten. The birds that will sing near our graves will be listened to
and admired by the visitor to the cemetery, but we will not receive even a
passing thought. Even those for whom our hearts throbbed with anxiety,
those for whose happiness we strove with so much labor, will scarcely
think of us. We will have been gathered to the dead, our term of activity
will have passed, our day will have ended, and with it all interest in us
will also end. We will be one of the millions laid away in the cemetery.
Has this thought no meaning for us? It ought to suggest the importance of
giving more attention to that which God had in view in creating us. Not
ambitious of what men may think of us, but ambitious of securing that
which we alone can obtain for ourselves, happiness in the life to come.
Then will our lonely and forgotten condition matter very little.

Prayer.

Release, O Lord, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


You have, perhaps, stood at the grave, and seen the earth cover the
remains of a dear one. It may have been the remains of the most beloved
one you ever knew. Oh, how you stood in need of consolation! There were
moments when you felt as if your heart must break. Yet when faith came to
your aid, and you remembered that the separation was only for a time, that
the moment of reunion would come, and you would again see the dear one,
only purified, glorified, and free from all the blemishes life on earth
entails, there was an awakening, a consolation, a strengthening, which no
other thought could bring. With this new feeling came the resolve to help
the one gone by such gifts as your love would dictate and your faith
direct. What if that dear one was condemned to tarry in a place of
purgation? What if you by your good works and prayers could assist, but
instead spent your time in fruitless lament and regrets? Then it was that
you felt all your old love quicken, and the eagerness which had led you to
care for the loved one in life, received a new incentive. You recollected
that the time in which he could help himself had passed, and he had to
rely entirely on the good services of his friends--that the hand of God was
to lay heavy upon him until the full measure of expiation had been paid.
There is comfort in the reflection that we can still be of service to
those we loved in life; we can be charitable to them, and improve
ourselves by the practice of that charity. The true Christian mourns his
friends, but he mourns over them, not with a vain hope, but with a
prayerful appeal to the throne of mercy.

Prayer.

Release, O Lord, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


The doctrine of purgatory implies two truths. First, that after a mortal
sin is forgiven in the Sacrament of Penance, and the eternal punishment
due to it is remitted, there still remains some debt of temporal
punishment to pay, either in this life--by deeds of penance--or in the next
in purgatory. Second, even venial sins are a stain which prevent the soul
from entering into heaven. These stains, therefore, must first be wiped
off, if the soul is to enter the abode of all holiness. Now, purgatory is
the place where the souls predestined to eternal glory are detained for a
time, and this period is fixed by God's justice for the purpose of
expiation and purification, until they are quite worthy of the everlasting
bliss prepared for them. Until the end of the world, until the last Day of
Judgment, there will be an intermediate place between heaven and hell.
Heaven is the place where only the just and holy are admitted. Hell is the
dungeon into whose depths are plunged the souls of the impious and
unrepenting. But purgatory lies between the two, and is meant to receive
for a time those souls of the just who will require some further
purification. And I am hurrying to one or the other place. Which shall it
be? Whichever it is it will be of my own making and choice. God is now
giving me time and opportunities sufficient to gain the one and avoid the
other. Let me reflect whither my course is leading me. Let me do it
now--to-morrow may be too late. God has given me only one life in which to
accomplish my salvation. According to the eternal decree that life will
end at the appointed time.

Sixth Day.


The Church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ, of which He is the Head,
and all the faithful are the members. It is divided into three parts: the
Church Militant on earth, consisting of the faithful who are still
fighting for their faith and struggling for their salvation; the Church
Triumphant, consisting of the saints in heaven; and finally, the Church
Suffering, consisting of the souls in purgatory. All the dead, then, who
die in the Lord, belong to the great mysterious body of Christ, either as
members glorified already, or as still awaiting the glory to come. But all
are united among themselves and form one great communion of saints.
Therefore when we consider what faith teaches us concerning the Church
Suffering, or purgatory, we cannot help exclaiming: "O faith! how
beautiful thou art! How touching is the communion of saints!" We children
of the Church Militant stretch forth one hand towards our brethren of the
Church Triumphant for help and protection; and with the other extended we
supplicate by our prayers, our alms, and patient sufferings, that the time
of probation for our brethren of the Church Suffering may be shortened. We
feel they entreat us to alleviate their torments, and their gratitude for
our good services will incline them to help us in our infirmities and
weakness. How often does this thought occupy our attention? It should
engage us frequently. As we are now so once were the souls in purgatory;
as they are now so we hope to be--for once in purgatory it means that
heaven is within our reach.

Prayer.

Release, O Lord, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


The Bible, in its very first pages, shows us that a custom of praying for
the dead existed among the people of the earliest centuries. This implies
the existence of purgatory, because it stands to reason that we do not
pray either for the saints in heaven or for the damned in hell. For, says
St. Thomas Aquinas, those prayers would be useless and in vain, if there
were no purgatory, because prayers cannot be offered up for those who have
already arrived at their end, but only for those who have not yet reached
their final destiny. When Jacob and Joseph were about to depart from this
world they earnestly besought those who stood around their death-beds,
especially their own children, to convey their mortal remains to
Palestine. For those pious patriarchs well knew that their descendants
there would offer sacrifices of expiation, and they hoped these offerings
would gain for them the longed-for peace and rest. On the announcement of
the death of Saul all the inhabitants of Jabes imposed upon themselves a
seven days' fast. The inspired poet-king takes part, not only in the
sorrow, but also in the sacrifices. He himself sings in touching, elevated
strain, the doctrine of purgatory, when describing the inexpressible joy
and delight of those souls who have happily passed through the fire and
water of tribulation, and have arrived at the ardently longed-for joy and
refreshment of the Lord. The prophet Micheas says: "I shall arise, when I
sit in darkness, the Lord is my light. I will bear the wrath of the Lord
because I have sinned against Him, until He judge my cause and execute
judgment for me: He will bring me forth into the light, I shall behold His
justice."

Eighth Day.


Instructed by holy and exalted prophets, the people of Israel, from the
earliest times, made sacrifices and offerings for the dead, and thereby
clearly showed their belief in purgatory. The records of all the past
centuries referring to the subject clearly show that not the smallest
doubt can be entertained on this point. When the star of the Jewish
civilization began to fade, the heroic line of the Machabees gathered all
their force once more together, in order to inaugurate a new epoch of
power and glory. In the description of their noble and heroic actions we
come across the unmistakable proof of their universal tradition and
belief. Judas, the mighty hero, having lost a great number of soldiers in
battle, did not confine himself to merely giving them an honorable burial.
He commanded a collection to be made, and sent the sum to Jerusalem for a
sacrifice to be offered for the fallen heroes. Holy Scripture concludes
the narrative with the words: "It is therefore a holy and a wholesome
thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from their
sins"--that is from all temporal punishment due to those sins. This thought
is justly called holy, because it springs from a holy source, that of
faith and charity. It is called wholesome, in the first place to the poor
souls themselves, because it comforts and encourages them in their
sufferings, in the next place to those who pray for them, because they
increase their own merits thereby, and gain new, faithful friends in
heaven.

Ninth Day.


The Holy Scriptures imply, in the narration of the action of the great
leader Judas, the existence of purgatory, or some such place of
purification in the next world, where the souls of the departed can be
assisted by our prayers and sacrifices, and be cleansed from their sins.
Certainly it would have been impossible, in such heavy time of war, to
gather from the people such large sums of money, or to all at once
introduce an innovation in religious practice of that kind, if this belief
in purgatory had not been long and firmly implanted in their hearts. All
the passages from the Old Testament clearly prove the truth of the
Catholic doctrine, which teaches us that there exists a place for the
purification of such souls as die in a state of grace, but have not yet
fully expiated all their sins; and that those souls can be delivered by
the prayers and good works of the faithful. The son of Sirach bears
witness to the same when he says: "A gift hath grace in the sight of all
the living, and restrain not grace from the dead," which means that we
should pay our dead the last respects and offer up sacrifices for them.
This passage supports the general belief of the Jews, that we can assist
the departed by good works. The Jews even now believe in the existence of
some place of purification, and are in the habit of praying for their
dead. The Jewish belief in purgatory rested on a very firm foundation.

In the fulness of time the divine Saviour Jesus Christ appeared on earth.
While disowning in His teaching all the false theories and erroneous
traditions of Scribes and Pharisees, while condemning with the greatest
precision their errors on the subject of death and resurrection, He never
uttered one syllable against the general belief in purgatory, or against
the public practice of praying for the dead. On the contrary He left it
just as it existed under the Old Law. Could the Son of God, Who had come
down to make known the will of His Father, have acted thus if this were
not a holy, just, and pious custom? The Redeemer did not find it necessary
to give lengthy proofs of the existence of this place of punishment. It
was enough to simply remind the people of it. For, in truth, He addressed
a people who had never entertained the smallest doubt on the subject. In
one of His sermons He unmistakably alludes to purgatory, where He speaks
of a prison from which no one can be delivered except on the payment of
the full debt. What other prison but purgatory can here be meant? Heaven
cannot be meant, and out of hell there is no redemption. The Gospels have
preserved another saying of the Son of God which presupposes the existence
of purgatory: "And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
shall be forgiven him; but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it
shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to
come." There are, then, sins which can be atoned for in the next world.

With regard to the doctrine of purgatory the apostles taught as their
divine Master did. St. Paul says: "For other foundation no man can lay but
that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus. Now if any man build upon this
foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's
work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because
it shall be revealed in fire, and the fire shall try every man's work of
what sort it is. If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereon, he
shall receive a reward. If any man's work burn he shall suffer loss: but
he himself shall be saved, but so as by fire."--1 Cor. iii. 12. He who
appears before the Judgment Seat of God with works still stained and
imperfect, will reach indeed his happy end, but not before those stains
and imperfections have been cleared away by a process which is like unto
the crucible of fire. The fire which the Apostle speaks of cannot be the
fire of tribulation, or the sufferings of this life; for he speaks of a
fire which burns on the Judgment Day; that is, after this life. Again, it
cannot mean the mere ordeal of the Judgment, because here the soul is not
only tried, but also burns and suffers from the burning. Nor can it mean
the fire of hell, because he who burns in the fire will come out of it and
be saved, which cannot be said of those in hell. The Apostle could only
have had the fire of purgatory in view--that fire which burns for the
purification of souls not quite spotless, and which will continue until
the Day of General Judgment.

Tradition excludes every doubt, even the least shadow of doubt, as to the
existence of purgatory. We have testimony from a whole army of renowned
writers of the Church: Sts. Augustine, Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Jerome,
Cyril, Gregory, up to Tertullian who lived in the second century. The
tradition is contained not only in the writings of the Holy Fathers, but
also in the practice of the Church reaching down to the apostolic age,
according to which prayers and sacrifices were at all times offered up to
God for the souls of the departed. Tertullian speaks of the sacrifices for
the dead as of an apostolic tradition, and St. John Damascene says, in his
sermon on the dead: "The apostles and disciples of our divine Saviour, who
had seen the eternal Word with their own eyes, and had converted the
multitudes of the living world, taught that in the awful, immaculate and
life-giving mysteries of the Eucharist, remembrance should be made of
those who died in the Lord." In confirmation of it he alleges the
testimony of St. John Chrysostom in these words: "That John, who on
account of his eloquence was called the golden-mouthed, teaches that not
inconsiderately or accidentally was it ordained by those wise disciples of
God and transmitted to the Church, that the priest should offer prayers
for the dead in the celebration of the awful divine mysteries."

We will now hear from the great St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo. I am
quoting from his treatise on the care for the dead. Mark how beautifully
he writes: "We read in the book of Machabees that there were sacrifices
offered up for the dead, but even if there had been no mention made of the
subject in the pages of the Old Testament, the authority of the Church
would be sufficient as manifested in her practice, according to which the
priest at the altar makes commemoration of the faithful departed." By her
funeral rites, offices and commemorations of the dead, as well as her
ancient Ordos, the Catholic Church has at all times clearly and definitely
testified to, and declared her belief in, the existence of purgatory.
Further, she has solemnly declared it an article of faith in several
Councils--as, for instance, in the General Council of Trent, which defines
that there is a purgatory, and that the faithful can come to the
assistance of the souls suffering therein by their prayers, and oblations
of the most holy sacrifice of the Mass. And it even threatens with
excommunication from the Church all those who maintain that every penitent
sinner, having received justification, is forgiven as to his guilt and
eternal punishment in such a way that there remains no temporal punishment
to be expiated in purgatory.

What a touching proof we have of the faith in the intercession of the
living for the dead, in the story of the life of St. Monica, the mother of
St. Augustine! As her son stood by the bedside of his dying mother, and
with difficulty tried to restrain his tears, Monica said to him: "Only one
thing I beg of thee; remember me always at the altar of God, wherever thou
dost chance to be." St. Augustine, therefore, often offered up the holy
sacrifice for his mother, and in his "Confessions" he entreats God in the
following touching prayer: "O God, grant that all Thy servants, who are my
brothers and to whom I have dedicated this book, grant that all who read
these prayers may, in their prayers before Thy altar, think of Thy
handmaid, my dearest mother, and pray for her in loving remembrance." When
St. Paul says that at the mention of the sacred name of Jesus every knee
shall bend in heaven, on earth and under the earth, by this last
expression "under the earth," according to the general opinion of the Holy
Fathers of the Church, he pointed to that temporal, intermediate place,
wherein imperfect souls must abide until they are purified from all stain
of sin, but even yet, while still there, are united in common adoration
with the saints who are in the full enjoyment of heaven, as well as with
all the Christians of the Church Militant on earth. But St. Paul teaches
us no less by example to offer up prayers and petitions to God almighty
for the souls of those who have died in the Lord.

Fifteenth Day.


We may, without great difficulty, infer the existence of purgatory from
the truths known by faith. Our faith teaches us that in the Sacrament of
Penance our sins are forgiven, together with the eternal punishment due to
them. The temporal punishment due to them is not always forgiven, however,
and consequently it remains to be endured either in this world or in the
next. Call to mind the examples of David, Moses, Peter and Mary Magdalene.
They were all forgiven their sins and the eternal punishment due to them,
and yet how much did those dear servants of God bewail their offences
during their whole lives and expiate the temporal punishment due to them!
Again there is another argument and ground on which our reason demands the
existence of a purgatory. It may be that a soul just departed this life is
free from all mortal sin--even free from all temporal punishment due to
grievous sin, but perhaps not free from certain light and venial sins,
which, though not destroying the grace of God in the soul, still darken
and stain its full splendor. It may be that all those venial sins are
atoned for and wiped away by the patiently borne agony of death, but how
often it happens that the Christian is suddenly surprised by death in
different forms, and when least expecting it. It would be contrary to
God's mercy and justice to cast that soul into hell, or to receive it at
once into heaven.

Sixteenth Day.


The doctrine that sinners, even after the guilt and eternal punishment due
to sin are remitted, have still, as a rule, to satisfy the justice of God
in some way, has been acknowledged by the Church both in deed and by
express word. By deed, because of her severe penitential discipline in the
early days of the Church, because of the works of penance enjoined in the
confessional, and the granting at all times of indulgences. By express
word because of the definition of the Council of Trent. Now if according
to the certain doctrine of faith, some temporal satisfaction remains to be
made after the remission of sin and eternal punishment, what, we ask, will
become of those souls who are suddenly called away before they have done
such penance as their sins required--before they have given full
satisfaction? Into heaven, where nothing impure can enter, they cannot be
received until the full debt is paid. Into hell they cannot be cast,
because they died in a state of grace and are friends and children of God.
Therefore, reason says, there must be a place where those just and holy,
though not yet thoroughly cleansed souls, must linger till purified
completely, and fully worthy of God's sacred presence. Were it otherwise
our reason would be darkened and troubled by doubts, either as to the
justice or as to the infinite mercy of God. Reason tells us that there is
a state of virtue not good enough for heaven, and a state of vice not bad
enough for hell. Common sense tells us that there is a difference between
sin and sin, and that consequently there must be a difference in the
punishment.

The souls in purgatory suffer. They are sent there to suffer. They are
detained there to suffer. The time of action is gone; the time of passive
suffering has come. Their whole existence, or life, is, as it were, taken
up with suffering. What are they suffering? Of what kind and character are
their sufferings? The pains of purgatory are just the same as the torments
of hell, with the exception of eternity and despair. The difference
between the two is, that the pains of purgatory come to an end, and are
not severed from the sweet hope of eternal happiness. Like the pains of
hell, so also the pains of purgatory are of two kinds. They are the pain
of loss and the pain of sense. These two kinds of pain correspond to the
twofold disorder contained in every sin. For every sin is first of all an
aversion or turning away from God, the highest and uncreated good--either a
complete aversion as in the case of mortal sin, or a partial aversion as
in the case of venial sin. Second, every sin is a conversion to, or a
turning towards, a created, real or apparent good as our highest good,
which is, of course, a disorderly conversion. Now this twofold
inordinateness must be expiated by a twofold corresponding punishment. For
wherein a man sins, says the Scripture, therein is he punished.

Man sins, and thus turns away from God; the punishment, therefore, must be
an eternal or temporary deprivation of God, the highest good of man. He
sins, and thus turns towards a created good, and derives pleasure and
satisfaction from it; the punishment, therefore, for this illicit, sensual
pleasure, is the pain of sense, the pain inflicted by created things. Now
fire is a pain of sense; and it is a doctrine sufficiently warranted by
Scripture and tradition, that the fire of purgatory is a real fire, by
which the souls are chastised and purified. The Holy Fathers explain that
the greatest imaginable sufferings here on earth, the most dreadful
martyrdom of the holy confessors of Christ, the worst pains of the most
terrible illness, can bear no comparison with the torments and pains
suffered by the poor souls in purgatory. Well known is the exclamation of
St. Augustine, "Here burn, here cut, here crucify, but spare me in
eternity, O God!" The sufferings of this life can be soothed by
consolation, can be softened by many distractions; now and again there is
a respite granted to the greatest sufferer, and time heals many woes. But
the sufferings of purgatory continue without any alleviation or
interruption.

According to the writings of the Fathers, the pain of loss is the greatest
of all the pains of purgatory. Together with the bitter remembrance of
having done evil and omitted to do good, is the consciousness of being
deprived of the beatific vision, than which there can be no greater pain.
St. Alphonsus says: "Far greater than the pains of the senses are the
pains of loss arising from the deprivation of the presence of God."
Because the poor souls are inflamed with not only the natural, but the
supernatural love of God, they are almost violently drawn towards Him,
their supreme good; and because they have the consciousness of being
debarred from perfect union with God by their own sins and imperfections,
they feel such exceeding great pain that it would kill them were it
possible for them to die. "Therefore," says St. Chrysostom, "is this pain
of loss greater than that of sense, and the greatest of all pains. A
thousand fires of hell could not produce greater pain than that which is
caused by the fully realized loss of God." Here on earth, while confined
in their bodies of sin, their souls could not enjoy the beatific vision;
but once delivered from their mortal bodies, the time is come when they
are able to see God, Who would be their everlasting joy were it not for
their own fault. It is this pain of separation that makes the pain of
purgatory a cleansing fire in the fullest sense of the word.

In this valley of tears the sighs of holy persons are full of pain and
sorrow, of pining after God and heaven. How painful must have been this
burning love and yearning desire in such souls as St. Paul's, St.
Augustine's and St. Teresa's! Yet what was their suffering compared to the
consuming fire of yearning in the souls of purgatory? For, however much we
may pine after God, our only good, still while on earth we have many
things that comfort us and deaden our pain. The very burden of our body,
the distracting events of life, the possibility of great age, or larger
store of merit, all these things are so many means of comfort to us. But
the poor souls in purgatory have none of these consolations; there is
nothing to assuage their pain of yearning and unfulfilled desire. More
than the panting hart do they thirst after the fountain of eternal light
and life. This unspeakable thirst is, in their case, all pure pain,
unmingled with any soothing alloy. Oh, what a burning sea of sorrow those
poor souls are plunged into! Flames within, flames without, flames all
around them! Were it not that God's omnipotent hand upheld them, their
spirit would almost be consumed by those flames of fire. As you have
noticed I have left you to draw from the proofs, as also from the
description of the flames of purgatory, your own pious deductions and
resolutions. But now I ask is there a doctrine in the Church which calls
for more serious and pious consideration than this belief in purgatory,
for your own spiritual benefit, and then for the help you can afford those
whom God's justice has condemned there?

It has always been a doctrine of the Church, no less than a practice, that
by our prayers and good works we can help the souls in purgatory. For the
Church not only taught the doctrine, but from the earliest times
encouraged the faithful to offer up the holy sacrifice for them. It was at
the great Council of Trent that the doctrine became an article of faith.
We are united to them in the communion of saints. This community is like
the members of one body. As in the body all the members help each other,
so in the communion of saints all have a share in the common goods, as the
Psalmist says, "I am a partaker with all them that fear Thee." If Christ
could make vicarious atonement to His heavenly Father for our sins, and
the eternal punishment due to them, then, also, the members of the
community founded by Him can, through His power and merits, assist and
make satisfaction for one another as regards the temporal punishment due
to their sins. So that, as the Apostle says, the abundance of one may
supply the want of the other, so that there may be an equality. The souls
in purgatory, then, since they are souls departed in the love of God,
belong with us to that great brotherhood, the communion of saints. So we
can come to their assistance, and by our efforts help to discharge the
debt they are still owing to God's justice. Or united to them by the bonds
of love, we form as it were one person. We pass the value of our good
works to them, and our heavenly Father looks upon the price we pay for
them as if paid by themselves.

Let us consider more particularly by what means we can assist the poor
souls. We can greatly and powerfully assist them, and the holy Council of
Trent expressly points out the means we should use. It says particularly
that the faithful can help the poor souls detained in purgatory by their
prayers, and by the most holy sacrifice of the Mass. This, as you will
perhaps observe, has been said several times already in this book. True,
but it is in order that I may point out the conditions which are required
to make those means effective that I again speak of them now. What is
necessary, primarily, is that we have the intention of helping the poor
souls, otherwise our good works are all put down to our own account, or if
we do not stand in need of them, they are put into what is called the
treasury of the Church, and then they are beyond our disposition. It is
not, however, necessary to make a new intention before every action. It is
sufficient to make once for all an intention of doing certain things for
the sake of the suffering souls, and then not withdrawing it again. Still
it is advisable to renew it now and again, as for instance at morning
prayers or at Mass. It is necessary to be in a state of grace if we wish
to help the souls by our good works or by our own personal prayers,
penance, indulgences, and so forth. He who is in a state of sin cannot
make satisfaction for himself; how then can he do so for others? How can
he who is a captive redeem himself, or give freedom to others?

The giving of alms for the benefit of the souls in purgatory, is one of
the means over which the Fathers of the Church grew eloquent. Nor indeed
is it necessary to make use of the sayings of the early Fathers, for we
can find abundant proof of the efficacy of alms related in the Holy
Scriptures. The angel Raphael said to Tobias: "Alms delivereth from death,
and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find mercy and
life everlasting." Elsewhere we find: "Water quencheth a flaming fire, and
alms resisteth sin." But let us listen to the Fathers of the Church. St.
Leo writes: "Alms atone for sin, destroy death, and extinguish the flames
of eternal fire." St. Chrysostom calls alms-giving "a heavenly ladder,
leading to God's right hand, and a sure refuge for those who give as well
as for those who receive." St. Paulinus praises a Roman nobleman, who on
the death of his beloved wife assembled all the poor and destitute of the
city in St. Peter's Church, and distributed food among them in order to
comfort and help her whose loss he bewailed. And St. Hieronymus, speaking
of the same nobleman, says that while other husbands adorn their wife's
graves with violets, roses and lilies, this one pours the balm of alms
over the sacred dust and venerable remains of his beloved wife. The
petition for alms from the worthy poor is like the knocking at your door
of a poor soul in purgatory.

What a beautiful Catholic practice is this of giving of the goods which
the good God has entrusted to us, for the benefit of the poor souls! Could
we not also set aside something for such a noble purpose? The alms we give
to the poor souls in purgatory may be likened to so many checks signed by
names dear to God, and which when presented He will not dishonor. When it
is difficult for us to give money in alms, we can at least give other
things of less value--even things that are no longer of use to us. How many
things there are in our homes that are not of the least use to us, which
if given in alms for the suffering souls might be of the greatest benefit
to us as well as to them! We give them in alms to the poor and forsaken
ones on earth, that they may benefit them as well as the poor forsaken
souls in purgatory. Perhaps you have a list of debtors, and perhaps in
that list there are many from whom you never expect to recover anything.
Why not make a promise, in case of the recovery of certain sums, to give
half to the deserving poor for the benefit of the suffering souls in
purgatory? It is not impossible that the guardian angel of purgatory may
help to restore to us money otherwise lost. Remember it is not the wealthy
alone who can give alms for this purpose, but the poor as well; at least
they can give their good-will. Do you remember that the angels sang at the
birth of the Redeemer: "Peace on earth to men of good-will"?

We have the authority of Holy Scripture for the efficacy of prayers: "It
is a holy and a wholesome thought to pray for the dead." It is holy
because it is most pleasing to God; it is wholesome because we have reason
to believe that through the infinite mercy and compassion of His Sacred
Heart, Our Lord accepts prayers offered in atonement for the sins of those
suffering in purgatory. If the prayers we offer for temporal goods are
often heard and granted, how much more so when we offer them for spiritual
goods, for the souls tenderly loved by God? Well might St. Augustine say:
"One cannot conceive a holier or more wholesome practice than praying for
the dead." The "Imitation of Christ" has the following: "Full of love and
charity, we must remember in our prayers the souls of the faithful
departed, but particularly the souls of our parents, friends and
relations, and those who have been our benefactors on earth. For that is a
work of real love and charity. As we entertain the most earnest hopes that
we shall be remembered when we shall have departed this life, we ought to
make every effort in our power to assist them to arrive speedily at their
promised abode of bliss, and by our prayers shorten the weary days of
their pilgrimage in purgatory. And we must remember that every one who
actively assists in the deliverance of these poor souls, gains for himself
the greatest advantages. By offering his prayers for their eternal repose,
he by no means loses the fruits of those prayers, for they are remembered
to him, and are before him when his time comes to die. And moreover one is
rewarded even in this life for such prayers."

The holy sacrifice of the Mass is the surest and most effectual means we
possess for procuring the eternal repose and happiness of the departed.
"The sacrament of love, the revelation of unity, and the bond of
friendship," says St. Augustine. "We pray for all who have departed this
life, with the most confident conviction that the prayers at the altar are
the most profitable to them," says St. Cyril. And again: "Supposing a king
who was offended by a subject has banished him from his kingdom, and the
friends of the outlaw wish to restore him to the king's favor, and for
that purpose form a deputation to the royal personage, and presenting a
costly gift, venture to plead for pardon for the offender; would not the
king comply with their request, and either grant the pardon, or mitigate
the punishment to some extent? Well, in like manner we, although sinners,
plead for pardon from the King of heaven and earth for our banished
friends, and with much surer hopes of success, for the gift we offer is
not an earthly crown, but is the body and blood of His own well-beloved
Son, Who has bled for the sins of the whole world." The holy sacrifice is,
I again repeat, the most effectual and the most powerful means we have for
assisting the suffering souls in purgatory.

Let me now suggest how you may act and pray during the holy sacrifice. At
the _Confiteor_ let us imagine the souls in the depths of purgatory; place
ourselves in the midst of them and hearken to their entreaties for help.
At the _Elevation_ let us say: "O my God, in memory of the painful death
Thou didst endure, have compassion on these poor souls for whom I pray. O
my God, behold Thy precious blood, which was shed for their deliverance.
Oh, let the saving fruits of this precious blood come to the poor souls,
let its cleansing streams flow into purgatory. Remember with what great
love Thou didst shed it for Thy elect, so many of whom are now languishing
in the fiery dungeon." We can fix our eyes on the crucifix placed over the
altar; it will help us to make our supplications more direct. The thorn-
crowned head will remind us of our superiors, spiritual and temporal,
perhaps in purgatory. The wounded right hand our parents, friends and
benefactors. The left hand the souls of those who have wished to do us
harm in life. Nor would it be amiss, while contemplating the wound in Our
Saviour's side, to recommend one's own soul. At the _Communion_ when we
see the sacred Host in the hands of the priest, let us consider that it is
the body of Him Who commanded us to pray for the dead. For it is He Who
said: "If you ask the Father anything in My name He will give it to you."
Let us remind Him of His words, and implore Him by His love. This is a
favorable moment to have our prayers heard.

The Catholic doctrine of the intercession of the saints must not be lost
sight of in this series of thoughts on the November devotion. In our
wants, personal wants, spiritual and temporal, we, true to our Catholic
instinct, first address ourselves to our Mother Mary for help. We must not
forget her in the matter of the poor souls. Mary's loving heart is not
less loving for the souls in purgatory than it was for the same souls
while in life. How can she abandon them? She never abandons a sinner on
earth. For a stronger reason she does not forget the souls of the just.
Mary loves them still, for her love is eternal. She is the Mother of Him
Who said, "I was in prison and ye visited Me;" of Him Who descended into
hell. Therefore it is an opinion well worthy of acceptance and respect,
founded on trustworthy revelations and authentic declarations, that the
Blessed Virgin assists in a most special manner the souls in purgatory.
They are souls and are poor, and therefore the Blessed Virgin loves them.
They are souls and are suffering; souls are the magnet of Mary's heart.
Priceless is the value of a soul, and no one has better shown it than Our
Lord Himself. Satan, by offering Him the whole world, could not prevail
upon Him to fall down; but by trying to rob Him of souls he caused Him to
bow down even to the earth under the weight of the cross. But, after
Jesus, who could better know the value of a soul than Mary, who comes next
to Him in the work He did for souls?

Mary stood by when her Son died for the redemption of souls. But through
her whole holy life she had constantly before her mind the work He had
come to accomplish. Now she sees those souls red with the divine blood by
which they were purchased. She lives in the joys of heaven, to which all
souls are likewise destined. Her Son gave His life for the souls of men;
but she as Mother gave her Son for that purpose. Therefore the love of her
heart embraces also purgatory; and therefore she is also the loving Mother
of the souls in purgatory. The woman in the Gospel who so eagerly and
persistently sought after her lost groat, is but a faint symbol of the
love of Mary for the souls which she has lost--though only for a time--which
she sees separated from heaven, from her Son, and from herself, and
suffering in the flames of fire. She burns with love for those poor souls,
well remembering the words of her divine Son, when He said that even a cup
of water given in His name would be rewarded with the joy of heaven. And
if Jesus, while hanging on the cross, cried out, "I thirst," which,
according to the opinion of the Holy Fathers, meant "I thirst for souls,"
can we suppose that Mary will not satisfy His desire, and still His
thirst? "Those who love and truly serve this most gentle Mother can indeed
be called fortunate, for not alone here on earth, but also hereafter in
purgatory, will she be their helper and comforter."

All the great servants of God had a great devotion to the souls in
purgatory, as we have seen. But as Our Lady is Queen of the heavenly host,
we cannot better conclude the treatment of the month than by giving the
last consideration to her. Mary loves the poor souls in purgatory, because
she has gone through a fire of tribulation--not in punishment for her sins,
for she had none--but that she might have more compassion for us, and be
more fully entitled to the name by which she is so well known, "Comforter
of the afflicted." For this reason her life was a sea of sorrow; for this
reason she endured tribulation, poverty, exile, and persecution. For this
reason she suffered tortures of mind and soul, in the three days' loss of
her Child, and in the more tragic separation on the cross. All these
sufferings were a real purgatory to her. Let us therefore venerate Mary,
and beg of her even now, while we still sojourn in this valley of tears,
to daily increase our ardor and give us perseverance in good works, to
obtain for us a happy death. But the best means to obtain this grace is to
imitate the love of the Blessed Virgin for the poor souls. Let us try and
be zealous in the cause of the poor souls, and often have recourse to this
Mother of mercy for the same purpose. In the recitation of the holy Rosary
we have a spiritual bunch of roses, which we can often offer to her for
the faithful departed. Let us scatter these spiritual roses plentifully
over the graves of our departed parents and friends. Mary, the Mother of
poor souls, will find them fragrant, and not only accept our offering but
also protect and guard us when our turn comes to die.

Mass for the Souls in Purgatory.


Before Mass.

O merciful Lord, we offer Thee the precious blood of the spotless Lamb, in
behalf of the suffering souls in purgatory, whose sole desire is to see
and glorify Thee in heaven. Open to them, O Lord, the infinite treasures
of Thy merits; apply to them the fruits of Thy Passion and death, and
through the adorable sacrifice of the Mass, release them from the debt due
to Thy sovereign justice. Amen.

Confiteor.

We confess our sins, O merciful God, in humility and sorrow of heart, and
we acknowledge that in Thy sight no one living is justified. Woe to us, if
Thou judge us according to Thy justice. To appease Thy anger, O Lord, we
recur to the unbloody sacrifice of Him Who was nailed to the cross for our
salvation, and who ceases not to intercede for us in heaven. O God of all
clemency! forgive us our sins, we entreat Thee, and forgive also the sins
committed by our deceased brethren, in the days of their mortal
pilgrimage. Let Thy mercy prevail over Thy justice, and let the voice of
the blood of Jesus plead more loudly for pardon than the voice of our
iniquities cries for vengeance. Amen.

Introit.

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon
them. "To Thee is due the hymn, O God, in Sion, and to Thee shall the vow
be paid in Jerusalem." Oh, hear my prayer: to Thee shall all flesh come.

"And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are
asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope. For if
we believe that Jesus died and rose again: even so them who have slept
through Jesus, will God bring with Him. For this we say unto you in the
word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the
Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept. For the Lord Himself shall
come down from heaven with commandment, and with the voice of an
archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ,
shall rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up
together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so
shall we be always with the Lord. Wherefore comfort ye one another with
these words."--1 Thess. 12-17.

resurrection, at the last day. Jesus said to her: I am the Resurrection
and the Life: he that believeth in Me, although he be dead, shall live:
And every one that liveth, and believeth in Me, shall not die forever.
Believest thou this? She saith to Him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that
Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God, Who art come into this
world."--John xi. 21-27.

Lord Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of the faithful
departed from the flames of hell, and from the deep pit. Deliver them from
the lion's mouth, lest hell swallow them; lest they fall into darkness.
And let the standard-bearer, St. Michael, bring them into holy light,
which Thou didst promise of old to Abraham and his posterity. We offer
Thee, O Lord, a sacrifice of praise and prayer: accept them in behalf of
the souls we commemorate this day, and let them pass from death to life,
which Thou didst promise of old to Abraham and His posterity. Remember, O
Lord, Thy compassion, and Thy tender mercies, which are from the
beginning. For ourselves also we pray: "One favor I have asked of Thee,
and this I will seek; that I may dwell in Thy house all the days of my
life. That I may see Thy beauty, and dwell forever in Thy temple. Amen."

Have mercy, we beseech Thee, O Lord, on the souls of Thy servants [_name

Jesus Christ Our Lord. Amen.

Preface.

It is truly just, and reasonable, and salutary, to return Thee thanks at
all times, and in all places, O almighty Father, eternal God. Through
Jesus Christ Our Lord, and through His merits, we hope for a glorious
resurrection; so that if the sentence of death alarm and deject, the
promise of immortality consoles and animates us; for to Thy faithful
servants death is only a passage from this life to a better. Therefore we
unite with all the blessed citizens of the heavenly country in singing a
hymn to Thy glory, and saying without ceasing: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
of Sabaoth: heaven and earth are full of Thy glory. Blessed is He that
cometh in the name of the Lord; His blood pleads for pardon, and His voice
rises ever to the throne of mercy in behalf of His miserable creatures.
Amen.

Canon.

O Father almighty, Whose kind providence extendeth to all creation, cast
an eye of pity on the souls that ardently love Thee, and whose greatest
suffering is to be separated from Thee. Remember, O Lord, that they are
the work of Thy hands, and that they have been purchased by the infinite
merits of Thy Son, Jesus Christ. Oh, will not the sound of that sweet name
move Thee to pity and forgiveness? We offer in their behalf, the precious
blood which streamed from the sacred side of our dying Redeemer on the
cross; we offer Thee the powerful intercession of the most blessed Mother
of Jesus and Queen of martyrs; we offer Thee the prayers of St. Joseph,
St. Peter, St. Paul, and all the saints, together with the earnest
supplications of Thy Church on earth; and we beseech Thee to take pity on
the souls Thou lovest so tenderly. Show them Thy glory, receive them into
Thy heart, and inundate them with that torrent of bliss, of which Thou art
the inexhaustible fountain. Amen.

Elevation.

O sacred Host! Victim of man's salvation! be propitious to us and hear our

Pater Noster.

O divine Jesus! at Whose name every knee doth bend, in heaven, on earth,
and in hell! Sovereign Judge of the living and the dead! may Thy name be
honored by the deliverance of the souls for whom we pray. May the gates of
heaven be open to receive them, and may Thy will, which desires the
salvation of all men, be this day perfectly done in their regard. Grant
that, after having been fed on the bread of sorrow, they may be fed with
the living bread of heaven in the possession of Thyself. We implore Thy
forgiveness of the sins of our parents, friends, and benefactors,
particularly of the sins to which we unhappily have been accessory.
Preserve us from those avenging flames, which we have but too well merited
by our repeated abuse of grace, our tepidity in Thy service, and our
negligence in resisting temptation. Deliver us from sin, the greatest of
all evils, and enable us to feel and understand that it is a dreadful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Amen.

Agnus Dei.

Lamb of God, Who by death didst trample on the devil, about to seize his
helpless prey, have mercy on the souls in purgatory! Lamb of God, Who wast
offered as a sacrifice of expiation, that by Thy death we might be rescued
from the slavery of sin, have mercy on the souls in purgatory! Lamb of
God, Who wast immolated for love of us that we might pass from the region
of malediction to the true land of promise, grant eternal rest to the
souls in purgatory! Amen.

Communion.

May eternal light shine on them, O Lord, together with Thy saints forever,
for Thou art merciful. Grant them, O Lord, eternal rest, and let perpetual
light shine upon them. Amen.

Post-Communion.

O God, Who willest that while we pray for the souls in purgatory, we
should at the same time remember the most essential of our duties, grant
us through Thy infinite merits and unbounded charity, the pardon of our
past negligences. We will not defer the all-important duty of penance,
lest it soon be too late to discharge our debts to Thee. We will fervently
and perseveringly pray for the souls in purgatory, and apply to them also
the fruits of our almsdeeds and exercises of mortification. O bountiful
God! bless these resolutions, and strengthen us to observe them
faithfully. Amen.

Last Gospel.

"I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the Last Day I shall rise out of
the earth: and I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I
shall see my God. Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and
not another. This my hope is laid up in my bosom."--Job xix. 25-27. After
having sat in darkness, and dwelt amidst the shades of death, we shall
rise to the contemplation of eternal life forever! "In Thee, O Lord, have
I hoped: let me never be confounded!" Amen.

O God, come to my assistance: O Lord, make haste to help me.

Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul.

O God, Whose property is always to have mercy and to spare, receive our
humble petition, that we, and all Thy servants who are bound by the chain
of sin, may, by the compassion of Thy goodness, mercifully be absolved.

Graciously hear, we beseech Thee, O Lord, the prayers of Thy suppliants,
and forgive the sins of them that confess to Thee; that, in Thy bounty,
Thou mayest grant us both pardon and peace.

Show forth upon us, O Lord, in Thy mercy, Thy unspeakable loving kindness;
that Thou mayest both loose us from all our sins and deliver us from the
punishments which we deserve for them.

O God, Who by sin art offended, and by penance pacified, mercifully regard
the prayers of Thy people making supplication to Thee, and turn away the
scourges of Thine anger, which we deserve for our sins.

Almighty, everlasting God, have mercy upon Thy servant [N.], our Sovereign
Pontiff, and direct him, according to Thy clemency, into the way of
everlasting salvation; that by Thy grace he may both desire those things
that are pleasing to Thee and perform them with all his strength.

O God, from Whom all holy desires, all right counsels, and all just works
do come, give unto Thy servants that peace which the world cannot give;
that our hearts being devoted to Thy commandments, and the fear of our
enemies being taken away, our times, by Thy protection, may be peaceful.

Inflame, O Lord, our reins and heart with the fire of the Holy Ghost; that
we may serve Thee with a chaste body, and please Thee with a clean heart.

O God, the Creator and Redeemer of all the faithful, give to the souls of
Thy servants departed the remission of all their sins; that through pious
supplications they may obtain the pardon which they have always desired.

Prompt, we beseech Thee, O Lord, our actions by Thy inspirations, and
further them with Thy continual help; that every prayer and work of ours
may always begin from Thee, and through Thee be likewise ended.

Almighty, everlasting God, Who hast dominion over the living and the dead,
and art merciful to all whom Thou foreknowest will be Thine by faith and
works: we humbly beseech Thee that they for whom we intend to pour forth
our prayers, whether this present world still detain them in the flesh, or
the world to come hath already received them stripped of their mortal
bodies, may, by the grace of Thy loving kindness, and by the intercession
of all the saints, obtain the remission of all their sins. Through Thy Son
Jesus Christ Our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee, in the unity of
the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.

_R._ Amen.

_V._ O Lord, hear my prayer.

_R._ And let my cry come unto Thee.

_V._ May the almighty and merciful Lord graciously hear us.

_R._ Amen.

_V._ And may the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

The Seven Penitential Psalms.


Ant. Remember not, O Lord, our offences, nor those of our parents, and
take not revenge on our sins.

Psalm VI.

_Domine ne in furore._

O Lord, rebuke me not in Thy indignation, nor chastise me in Thy wrath.

Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak: heal me, O Lord, for my bones are
troubled.

And my soul is troubled exceedingly: but Thou, O Lord, how long?

Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: Oh, save me for Thy mercy's sake.

For there is no one in death that is mindful of Thee: and who shall
confess to Thee in hell?

I have labored in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I will
water my couch with my tears.

My eye is troubled through indignation: I have grown old amongst all my
enemies.

Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord hath heard the
voice of my weeping.

The Lord hath heard my supplication: the Lord hath received my prayer.

Let all my enemies be ashamed, and be very much troubled: let them be
turned back, and be ashamed very speedily.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

Psalm XXXI.

_Beati quorum._

Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are
covered.

Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in whose
spirit there is no guile.

Because I was silent my bones grew old, whilst I cried out all the day
long.

For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me: I am turned in my anguish
whilst the thorn is fastened.

I have acknowledged my sin to Thee, and my injustice I have not concealed.

I said I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord; and Thou
hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.

For this shall every one that is holy pray to Thee in a seasonable time.

And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto Him.

Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me: my joy,
deliver me from them that surround me.

I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way in
which thou shalt go: I will fix My eyes upon thee.

Do not become like the horse and the mule, which have no understanding.

With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not near unto Thee.

Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass him that
hopeth in the Lord.

Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, ye just: and glory, all ye right of
heart.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

Psalm XXXVII.

_Domine ne in furore._

Rebuke me not, O Lord, in Thy indignation; nor chastise me in Thy wrath.

For Thy arrows are fastened in me: and Thy hand hath been strong upon me.

There is no health in my flesh, because of Thy wrath: there is no peace in
my bones, because of my sins.

For my iniquities are gone over my head: and, as a heavy burden, are
become heavy upon me.

My sores are putrefied and corrupted, because of my foolishness.

I am become miserable, and am bowed down, even to the end; I walked
sorrowfully all the day long.

For my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no health in my
flesh.

I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: I roared with the groaning of my
heart.

Lord, all my desire is before Thee, and my groaning is not hidden from
Thee.

My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of my eyes
itself is not with me.

My friends and my neighbors have drawn near, and stood against me.

And they that were near me stood afar off: and they that sought my soul
used violence.

And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits
all the day long.

But I, as a deaf man, heard not: and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.

And I became as a man that heareth not: and that hath no reproofs in his
mouth.

For in Thee, O Lord, have I hoped: Thou wilt hear me, O Lord, my God.

For I said: Lest, at any time, my enemies rejoice over me; and whilst my
feet are moved, they speak great things against me.

For I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is continually before me.

For I will declare my iniquity: and I will think for my sin.

But my enemies live, and are stronger than I: and they that hate me
wrongfully are multiplied.

They that render evil for good have detracted me, because I followed
goodness.

Forsake me not, O Lord, my God: do not Thou depart from me. Attend unto my
help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

Psalm L.

_Miserere._

Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy.

And according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies, blot out my
iniquity.

Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.

To Thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before Thee: that Thou
mayest be justified in Thy words, and mayest overcome when Thou art
judged.

For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my mother
conceive me.

For, behold, Thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things of Thy
wisdom Thou hast made manifest to me.

Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed: Thou shalt
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

To my hearing Thou shalt give joy and gladness; and the bones that have
been humbled shall rejoice.

Turn away Thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.

Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right spirit within my
bowels.

Cast me not away from Thy face; and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.

Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and strengthen me with a perfect
spirit.

I will teach the unjust Thy ways: and the wicked shall be converted to
Thee.

Deliver me from blood, O God, Thou God of my salvation: and my tongue
shall extol Thy justice.

O Lord, Thou wilt open my lips: and my mouth shall declare Thy praise.

For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: with
burnt-offerings Thou wilt not be delighted.

A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled heart, O
God, Thou wilt not despise.

Deal favorably, O Lord, in Thy good-will with Sion: that the walls of
Jerusalem may be built up.

Then shalt Thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole
burnt-offerings: then shall they lay calves upon Thy altar.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

Psalm CI.

_Domine exaudi._

Hear, O Lord, my prayer: and let my cry come to Thee.

Turn not away Thy face from me: in the day when I am in trouble incline
Thy ear to me.

In what day soever I shall call upon Thee, hear me speedily.

For my days are vanished like smoke: and my bones are grown dry like fuel
for the fire.

I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered, because I forgot to eat
my bread.

Through the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my flesh.

I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness: I am like a night-raven
in the house.

I have watched, and become as a sparrow, all alone on the house-top.

All the day long my enemies reproached me: and they that praised me did
swear against me.

For I did eat ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.

Because of Thy anger and indignation: for having lifted me up, Thou hast
thrown me down.

My days have declined like a shadow, and I am withered like grass.

But Thou, O Lord, endurest forever: and Thy memorial for all generations.

Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion: for it is time to have mercy on
it, for the time is come.

For the stones thereof have pleased Thy servants: and they shall have pity
on the earth thereof.

And the Gentiles shall fear Thy name, O Lord, and all the kings of the
earth Thy glory.

For the Lord hath built up Sion: and He shall be seen in His glory.

He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: and He hath not despised
their petition.

Let these things be written unto another generation: and the people that
shall be created shall praise the Lord.

Because He has looked forth from His high sanctuary: from heaven the Lord
hath looked upon the earth.

That He might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: that He might
release the children of the slain.

That they might declare the name of the Lord in Sion, and His praise in
Jerusalem.

When the people assemble together, and the kings, to serve the Lord.

He answered Him in the way of his strength: Declare unto me the fewness of
my days.

Call me not away in the midst of my days: Thy years are unto generation
and generation.

In the beginning, O Lord, Thou foundest the earth; and the heavens are the
works of Thy hands.

They shall perish, but Thou remainest: and all of them shall grow old like
a garment:

And as a vesture Thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed. But
Thou art always the self-same, and Thy years shall not fail.

The children of Thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall be
directed forever.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

Psalm CXXIX.

_De profundis._

Out of the depths I have cried to Thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.

Let Thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.

If Thou, O Lord, wilt mark iniquities, Lord, who shall stand?

For with Thee there is merciful forgiveness; and by reason of Thy law I
have waited for Thee, O Lord!

My soul hath relied on His word: my soul hath hoped in the Lord.

From the morning watch even until night, let Israel hope in the Lord.

Because with the Lord there is mercy: and with Him plentiful redemption.

And He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

Psalm CXLII.

_Domine exaudi._

Hear, O Lord, my prayer: give ear to my supplication in Thy truth: hear me
in Thy justice.

And enter not into judgment with Thy servant: for in Thy sight no man
living shall be justified.

For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: he hath brought down my life to the
earth.

He hath made me to dwell in the darkness as those that have been dead of
old: and my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is
troubled.

I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all Thy works: I meditated
upon the works of Thy hands.

I stretched forth my hands to Thee: my soul is as earth without water unto
Thee.

Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit hath fainted away.

Turn not away Thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into
the pit.

Cause me to hear Thy mercy in the morning: for in Thee have I hoped.

Make the way known to me, wherein I should walk: for I have lifted up my
soul to Thee.

Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord; to Thee have I fled: teach me to do
Thy will, for Thou art my God.

Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the right land: and for Thy name's
sake, O Lord, Thou wilt quicken me in Thy justice.

Thou wilt bring my soul out of trouble: and in Thy mercy Thou wilt destroy
my enemies.

And Thou wilt cut off all them that afflict my soul: for I am Thy servant.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

_Ant._ Remember not, O Lord, our offences, nor those of our parents, and
take not revenge of our sins.




Efficacious Prayers for the Souls in Purgatory.


A Daily Exercise For The Relief Of The Poor Souls.

O most loving God, Father of mercies, God of infinite goodness, behold me
humbly prostrate before Thy throne; I pray and beseech Thee to have pity
on the holy souls that are in the pains of purgatory. Cast on them a look
of mercy, free them from their pains, and put them in possession of the
inheritance of heaven. Remember that they are the work of Thy hands,
redeemed by the most precious blood of Thy divine Son Jesus: deal with
them according to Thine infinite mercy. Hear, O Lord, the prayer I make to
Thee with all confidence, through the merits of the Passion and death of
Thy most dear Son Jesus, that they may be consoled, and may enjoy without
delay that immortal glory which Thou hast prepared for Thine elect. O
merciful Lord, have pity upon them, according to our trust in Thee. Amen.

O Lord God almighty, I supplicate Thee, through the precious blood which
poured forth from the side of Thy divine Son Jesus, in the sight and to
the exceeding suffering of His most holy Mother; set free the souls in
purgatory, and especially, among them all, the one which was most devout
to this great Queen; in order that it may speedily come to Thy glory to
praise Thee in her, and her in Thee for all eternity. Amen.

An Invocation of the Most Holy Trinity for the Souls in Purgatory.


O God of all goodness, Father of mercies, Who, at the prayers and fastings
of Thy faithful people, didst vouchsafe to send Thy angels to break
asunder the fetters of Thy holy apostle Peter, and to open the doors of
his prison; hear even also on this day the prayers and supplications of
Thy Church, and send Thy angel to the souls for whom we pray, that, the
doors of their prison being opened wide, they may be happily received into
the bosom of Thy mercy.

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father, etc., etc.

O Son of God, Saviour of souls, Who didst refresh the three children in
the burning fiery furnace, pour down upon the souls that cry to Thee from
the flames, Thy heavenly dew. Thy precious blood alone can quench the
flames of purgatory; oh, let it now flow down upon these suffering souls,
and do Thou, O Lord, have mercy upon them.

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father, etc., etc.

O Spirit of love, have compassion on the cruel torment which these souls
endure, that are filled with the purest charity, and, aspiring without
ceasing towards their God, cry aloud in their distress, "I thirst: I
thirst after my God!" and yet cannot attain unto the object of their love,
nor receive the least drop of that torrent of pure delights. O Holy
Spirit, grant that, having felt the fiercest pangs of love, they may taste
its heavenly delights in a blessed eternity. Amen.

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father, etc., etc.

Prayer that may be used by Surviving Friends.

Grant, O Lord, we beseech Thee, that while we lament the departure of Thy
servant, we may always remember that we are most certainly to follow him
[her]. Give us grace to prepare for that last hour by a good and holy
life, that we may not be taken unprepared by sudden death, but may be ever
on the watch, that, when Thou shalt call, we may go forth to meet the
Bridegroom, and enter with Him into glory everlasting. Through the same
Jesus Christ Our Lord. Amen.

O most wise and merciful Lord, Who hast ordained this life as a passage to
the future, confining our repentance to the time of our pilgrimage here,
and reserving for hereafter the state of punishment and reward; vouchsafe
to us who are yet alive, and have still the opportunity of reconciliation
with Thee, the grace so to watch over all our actions, and to correct
every slightest wandering from the true way to heaven, that we may not be
surprised with our sins uncancelled or our duties unfulfilled; but when
our bodies shall go down into the grave, our souls may ascend to Thee, and
dwell with Thee forever in the mansions of eternal bliss. Through Jesus
Christ Our Lord and only Saviour. Amen.

DECEMBER. ADVENT.


Christ Jesus, Whom we are going to seek this month, has two thrones: one
of grace and one of justice. While we live we can always approach the
throne of grace. This throne is placed for our refuge, and the pardon of
our sins. Ask and you shall receive; if your sins are as black as jet,
they shall be made white as snow.

When we approach the throne of God's mercy, love and grace, we must come
deeply penetrated with the knowledge, "Without Me you can do
nothing."--John xv. 5. We have not the grace, nor the strength, nor the
willingness, nor the intelligence to do good of ourselves without the help
of Jesus. Let us then go with confidence to the throne of grace, that we
may obtain mercy and find grace.

Let us have great confidence in God's mercy; let us feel, in the depths of
our hearts, a conviction that the only source whence a poor sinner can
expect effectual help is from God's love. "Although He should kill me I
will trust in Him." We need aid, and we will get that help without fail.

The Church shows her wisdom by not showing us the manger during Advent;
for one entire month she tells us, "Prepare yourselves that you may be fit
to approach the Infant Jesus at the time of His birth. You must prepare
your heart by meditation, by a lively faith, a fervent love, a true
humility, a sweetness of character, and a spirit of penance and
recollection." On Christmas day the Lord is not born corporally, as He was
at Bethlehem; but He will be born spiritually in our hearts, if they have
been well prepared for His reception.




Considerations and Prayers for Every Day.



First Day.


Advent is the season in which we are taught to look forward to the coming
of Our Lord into the world at Christmas, and also to His second coming at
the end of time, to judge the living and the dead. His first coming was to
seek and to save that which was lost; the second will be to gather in the
fruits of His labors, the souls that are saved. The sacred time of Advent
is therefore a preparation for Christmas, established by the Church, and
at the same time it leads us to look for the coming of Christ at the end,
and to conform our lives to the life of Christ, so that when we meet Him
on the Last Day it will not be in fear and trembling, but with joy,
because we have been selected to return with Him to heaven. We will, then,
with alacrity enter into this employment during this month, knowing that
if we have prepared well for His first coming, we shall be in a fit state
to receive Him at His second advent. The time of Advent, according to the
Church, is a time of penance, not so great as Lent, but the spirit should
be the same. Every morning, if possible, attend Mass in honor of the
coming of Christ, and on Fridays impose a slight penance on yourself.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, vouchsafe to reduce Thy
incarnated divinity and most divine humanity to the humiliating state of
birth and infancy: grant that we, acknowledging Thy infinite wisdom in Thy
infancy, Thy power in Thy weakness, and Thy majesty in Thy littleness, may
adore Thee, a little one on earth, and behold Thee great in heaven. Who
livest and reignest with God the Father, in unity with the Holy Ghost,
world without end. Amen.



Second Day.


Of all the miracles in the world, never was there one to be compared to
that of the coming of the Son of God on earth, in the humble form of a
child. It was a miracle so entirely above our reasoning, that unless we
knew it by faith established by revelation, we would say it was impossible
and believe it as little as many of the unbelieving Jews did. That the
infinite God should take the form of a poor creature: that God should so
unite Himself to that creature of His, as to assume its lowliness, clad in
the dust and clay of the earth, is a very great miracle. It was, however,
the infinite power of the Almighty that did this. "For us men, and for our
salvation, He came down from heaven. He humbled Himself, and became
obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross." Who can now refuse
to believe in the love of God for His creatures? Men looking at life in a
certain light, have doubted God's goodness to humanity; but let them once
contemplate the world from our point of view and they will necessarily
admit that He loved us to excess, and that He still continues to love us.
Oh, shall we not then return Him love for love?

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Third Day.


What was it that induced God to work such a miracle in behalf of mankind,
as to send His only-begotten Son to this world? It was man's sin. From all
eternity the Blessed Trinity had decreed that in consequence of sin there
was a necessity of redemption; that the eternal Word should be born into
the world, if man was not to be left to the fate of everlasting perdition.
Man could not redeem himself; an angel could not give sufficient
satisfaction; none but God Himself could offer atonement for man. Hence,
God, in His great goodness and mercy, resolved to do this work of
redemption. He provides a remedy for all the sins and follies of men, even
before they are committed. We do the harm, and God has to undo it. Has He
not often thus averted from me the consequences due to my evil deeds? What
have I done in my life but wickedness, and very little good? My life has
been so filled with iniquity, that shame fills my heart when I think of
the past. I have not only to bear the sins of Adam and Eve, but I have to
atone for my own sins. So great have these sins been, that the Son of God
had to descend very low to reach our level.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Fourth Day.


The Fathers of the Church, and the Church herself, exclaim, "O happy
fault, that caused the Word to be made flesh, and to dwell among us! O
happy transgression, which earned a Redeemer such as this!" We gained more
than we lost. Adam and Eve were perfect for a time in the sight of God,
but when they fell, they lost all. Then came the redemption, and we were
admitted into the Church of God, a fountain so full of graces, by means of
the sacraments. Our places were secured in heaven by the blood of the
Lamb. What a great gift was that blood of Jesus Christ, poured over our
soul! What a glorious wound was that which was cured by so adorable a
power! We have hope once more, again we breathe freely in the bright trust
of being children of God, and heirs of the kingdom of heaven. So that from
the time of Adam and Eve, there had been a hope in the human breast that
God would come to redeem mankind. Adam and all his children were ever
looking and praying for His coming; and now during Advent we are preparing
for the coming of Him Who is to rejoice every heart. "Come quickly, O Lord
Jesus."

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Fifth Day.


The children of Adam had to lament the deadly effects of the evil they had
committed. As generation followed generation, thicker grew the darkness in
the minds and hearts of the people, and farther and farther away did they
wander from that eternal Light, which was to guide them to heaven. Thus it
is that sin goes on, spreading its painful consequences throughout the
world, even long after the evil-doer is dead and gone. Gradually the world
lost all regard for virtue, or for God, until it became so wicked that
unless the Redeemer appeared when He did, mankind would have been plunged
into absolute barbarism, and worked its own destruction. If I had lived
then, what kind of a human being would I have been?--who even now, while
enjoying the light of civilization and the freedom with which God has
enriched me, am such a poor specimen of a Christian. I who have been made
by God, for God, and in the image of God.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Sixth Day.


Our life is a circle. We came from God, and to God we must return. If we
have deserted Him we must go back, if our life is to be a success in the
end. We can never find repose or lasting satisfaction in anything but God.
Until we make Him the end and aim of our life, we shall feel that we are
wandering about in the dark. This was the case with the world, which had
gone from its Creator; deeper and deeper it sank in the mire of iniquity.
We must do as Christ bids us, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God." We seek
Him by a thorough preparation for His coming, for He will come to meet us,
and will be ready to receive us and take us back into His affection. God
comes to us repeatedly in life; but we do not know His fulness. Yet it is
a sad loss that we are so blind. It is the only real misery in life, that
we are meeting God every day, and do not know Him when we meet Him.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Seventh Day.


At length, on the distant horizon, can be discerned the dawn of the Sun
that has been so long desired to enlighten the world. The happy Mother of
the Messias was to be born before He could come. This is the eve of the
feast of the Immaculate Conception; the earth has now a pledge that the
coming of the Messias will no longer be delayed, the Son of man is near at
hand. The conception of Mary takes place under the direct providence of
God; she receives the breath of life from God, without any stain of sin.
The feast of the Blessed Virgin's Immaculate Conception is the most solemn
of all those which the Church celebrates during the holy season of Advent.
We will, then, honor the feast of the Blessed Virgin with joy. The
intention of the feast is not only to celebrate the anniversary of the
happy moment in which began, in the womb of the pious Ann, the life of the
ever glorious Virgin Mary: but also to honor the sublime privilege by
which Mary was preserved from the stain of original sin--which, by the
curse of God on our first parents, darkened the souls of all the
descendants of Adam and Eve at the very first moment of their conception.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Eighth Day.


The faith of the Catholic Church on the conception of Mary, is this: that,
at the very instant when God united the soul of Mary, which He had created
with a special regard to the Mother of His divine Son, to the body which
it was to animate, this ever blessed soul not only did not contract the
stain of that curse which defiles every human soul, but was filled with an
immeasurable grace, which rendered it from that moment the mirror of
sanctity of God Himself, as far as this is possible to a creature. It was
due to His own infinite sanctity that God should suspend, in this
instance, the law which His divine justice had passed upon all the
children of Adam. The relations which Mary was to bear to the divinity
could not be reconciled with her undergoing the humiliations of man's
punishment. She was not only the Daughter of the eternal Father: she was
destined also to become the very Mother of the Son, and the Bride of the
Holy Ghost. Nothing defiled could be permitted to enter, even for the
shortest time, that sacred structure.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Ninth Day.


St. Anselm, a Doctor of the Church, tells us, in his time, when the
doctrine of the Immaculate Conception had not yet been declared, that, "It
was just that this holy Virgin should be adorned with the greatest purity
which can be conceived, after that of God Himself, since God the Father
was to give her as her Child that only-begotten Son, Whom He loved as
Himself, as being begotten to Him from His own bosom, and this in such a
manner that the self-same Son of God was by nature the Son of both God the
Father, and of this Blessed Virgin. This same Son chose her to be
substantially His Mother: and the Holy Ghost willed that in her womb He
would operate the conception and birth of Him from Whom He Himself
proceeded." When we remember that Mary is the "Mother of God," so far from
being surprised at the privileges which we see the Church giving her, we
approve of all. That the Almighty would shower down upon her the choicest
graces of heaven, and by special privileges distinguish her from all the
children of God, seems only just. Mary was so surrounded and strengthened
by grace that she never committed the least sin during her life.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Tenth Day.


The closeness of the tie between Mother and Son gave Mary all the
privileges and distinctions which she enjoys. This closeness was to unite
the Son of God with Mary, and was to elicit from Him the most tender love
and the most filial reverence. All this had been present to the thought of
God from all eternity, and the conclusion forces itself upon our mind,
that therefore the divine Word had, for His future Mother, a love
infinitely greater than that which He bore for all other creatures. Mary's
honor was infinitely dear to Him, because she was to be His Mother, chosen
to be so by His eternal and merciful decrees. The Son's love protected the
Mother. She, indeed, in her sublime humility, willingly submitted to
whatever the rest of God's creatures had brought on themselves, and obeyed
every tittle of those laws which were never meant for her. "O Mary, O
marvellous, mystical creature! O resplendent mote, lost almost to view in
the upper light of the supernal fountains! Who can sufficiently abase
himself before thee, and weep for the want of love to love thee rightly,
thou whom the Word so loved eternally?" (Faber.)

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Eleventh Day.


Mary was conceived without sin, because the eternal Father would not do
less for the second Eve than He had done for the first; yet the latter was
created, as was also the first Adam, in the state of original justice,
which she forfeited by her disobedience. The Son of God would not permit
that Mary, from whom He was to take the nature of man, should be deprived
of that gift which He had given to Eve. The Holy Ghost, Who was to
overshadow Mary, and through whose operation she was to become the Mother
of the Incarnate Word, would not permit that foul stain of sin in which we
are all conceived to rest even for an instant on His Bride. All men were
to contract the sin of Adam. The sentence was universal, the condemnation
went out against all the race; but God's own Mother could not be included.
God, Who is the Author of that law; God, Who was free to make it as He
willed, had power to save her from its effects; His omnipotence could
exempt her, and it was nothing more than proper, even according to our
frail reason, that she was exempted.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Twelfth Day.


Certainly God's omnipotence came into active operation when He created the
soul of Mary. When Adam and Eve stood before Him in the garden of
paradise, the Lord said to the woman, "Why hast thou done this?" She
replied, "The serpent deceived me, and I did eat." Then God was angry, and
turning to the serpent He said, "I will put enmity between thy seed and
her seed; she shall crush thy head." Thus was salvation promised to the
human race, under the form of a victory over Satan, and it is to be gained
by the woman. The second Eve is to be worthy of the second Adam,
conquering Satan and sin. The human race is one day to be avenged, not
only by God made man, but also by the woman miraculously exempted from
every sin, in whom the primeval creation, which was in justice and
holiness, will thus reappear, as though original sin had never been
committed. Raise up your hands then, ye children of Adam, and shake off
your chains. On this day of the Immaculate Conception the humiliation
which weighed you down so heavily is annihilated.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Thirteenth Day.


The dignity of the human race is well portrayed when we see that God so
blessed its members. The Lord loves the human race, and was pleased to be
called the Son of man. He still loves this guilty earth, since He has
deigned to enlighten it with one of the brightest rays of His Mother's
glory. How the world ought to exult on this feast of the Immaculate
Conception! The present generation will never forget the enthusiasm with
which the entire universe received the tidings of the definition of the
dogma. It was an event of mysterious importance, which thus marks this
second half of our century, and we shall look forward to the future with
confidence. For the Holy Ghost bids us tremble for the days when truths
are diminished among the children of men. He would consequently have us
look on these times as blessed by God, in which we receive an increase of
truth, and an increase both in light and authority. The Church always
professed belief in the Immaculate Conception; it is not a new doctrine.
She had always kept the 8th of December as the feast of the conception of
Mary. Now we add, "Immaculate" Conception.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Fourteenth Day.


There have been no new doctrines added to the dogmas of the Church. People
are sometimes scandalized when they hear, from Protestant and infidel
sources, that the Church is continually adding to her faith without any
warrant from God. Such, however, is not a fact. The present living Church
can add nothing to the revelation of Our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
St. Bernard and the Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas, both teach that the Church
cannot celebrate the feast of what is not holy. From time immemorial the
feast of the Immaculate Conception has been celebrated; it was considered
holy then, and is now no new doctrine. The nativity of the same holy
Virgin is kept as a solemnity in the Church, because Mary was born full of
grace. Therefore, had the first moment of Mary's existence been one of
sin, as that of all the other children of Adam, it never could have been
made the subject of reverence by the Church. O Mary, thou bright ray of
hope, penetrate our hearts, that we may rejoice in thy motherhood; thou
art the dearest, purest, holiest Mother, whom we love most tenderly.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Fifteenth Day.


How thy gentle light gladdens our weary eyes, sweet Mother! Generations
had followed generations on this earth of ours; men looked up to heaven
through their tears, hoping to see on the horizon the Star which they had
been told should disperse the gloomy horrors of the world's darkness. O
thou fair Morning Star, which dost shed thy blessed rays on the sea, and
dost bring calm after long stormy night, prepare our eyes, that they may
behold the divine Sun which will soon follow in thy path, and give to the
world His reign of light. To see Jesus in truth our hearts must be pure;
purify them, then, O Mother, especially during this sacred time of Advent,
that we, the children of the Church, reflecting on the jealous care
wherewith God preserved thee from every stain of sin, because thou wast to
be the Mother of His divine Son, might prepare to receive this same Jesus
by the most perfect renouncing of every sin, and every attachment to it.
Cease not to bless and protect all these that honor thy great privilege of
being conceived without sin. May this feast fit us for the birth of Jesus
in Bethlehem. Thou art all beautiful, O Mary, and there is no stain of sin
in thee.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Sixteenth Day.


The Church cries out a welcome to the advent of Christ, during this time;
making us feel as if we sat in darkness, as if we were as degraded as was
man before the coming of the Messias: "O Wisdom," she cries out, "Who
camest forth from the mouth of the Most High, reaching in Thy strength
from end to end, and sweetly disposing all things, come teach us the way
of prudence." The first title given to Jesus is that of Wisdom, the
eternal Wisdom of God, and the source of all wisdom to men for all time.
The eternal Word disposes all things sweetly: everything that happens in
heaven and on earth is arranged by Him, not unkindly, nor harshly, but
sweetly. We invite Him to come and teach us the ways of prudence, because
where there is prudence all must be well. Teach me, O Jesus, the lesson of
prudence, which will guide me safely to the kingdom of heaven. The prophet
Micheas says of the Child to be born in Bethlehem: "His going forth is
from the beginning from the days of eternity." O divine Wisdom, how strong
art Thou, in thus reaching Thine ends by means which are infallible though
hidden!

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Seventeenth Day.


O Adonai and Leader of the house of Israel, Who didst appear to Moses in
the fire of the flaming bush, and didst give him the Law on Sinai, come
and save us with a stretched forth arm! O sovereign, almighty Lord, come
to redeem us! Heretofore Thou didst show Thyself to Moses in a fiery bush,
Thou didst give Thy Law to Thy people amidst thunder and lightning on
Mount Sinai; come and redeem us now in the goodness of Thy Heart, in
kindness and love. Thy chaste Mother, having heard the emperor's edict,
which obliges her and Joseph, her spouse, to repair to Bethlehem, prepares
everything needful for Thy divine birth. She makes ready the humble
swaddling-clothes which are to cover and protect Thee from the cold of
that midnight hour. Thus it is that Thou willest to deliver us from the
slavery of pride, and to show man that Thy divine arm is never stronger
than when he thinks it powerless. Everything is prepared for Thy
reception, except our hearts, which still await Thy holy grace, which is
to change them, and make them fit temples for Thy abode.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Eighteenth Day.


The expectation of the birth of Our Lord is a fact which is celebrated
throughout the Church. The expectation of the world is now at its greatest
tension. Nobody knows whether the event of the birth of Christ is going to
take place to-day, or to-morrow; but soon it will be accomplished.
Everything is in readiness; the earth groans for need of the Lord, the
holy people pray that they may see the great day; we, too, on this feast,
will pray for the coming of the Lord. We wish with all our hearts that the
Messias would come. Most just indeed it is, O holy Mother of God, that we
should unite in that ardent desire thou hadst to see Him, Who had been
concealed for nine months in thy chaste womb; to know the features of the
Son of the heavenly Father; to come to that blissful hour of His birth,
which will give glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace to men of
good-will. Yes, dear Mother, the time is fast approaching, though not fast
enough to satisfy thy desires and ours. Make us, O Mary, redouble our
attention to this great mystery; complete our preparation by thy powerful
prayers for us, that when His hour has come, Jesus may find no obstacle to
His entry into our hearts.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Nineteenth Day.


O Root of Jesse, Who standest as the standard of the people, before Whom
kings shall not open their lips; to Whom the nations shall pray, come and
deliver us: tarry now no more. At length, O Son of Jesse, Thou art
approaching the city of Thy ancestors! The ark of the Lord has arisen, and
is journeying with the God that is in her to the place of rest. "How
beautiful are thy steps, O thou daughter of the Prince," now that thou art
bringing to the cities of Juda their salvation! The angels escort thee,
heaven delights in thee, and earth thrills with joy to bear thus upon
itself, its Creator and its Queen. Blessed is the womb of the Virgin Mary,
which bore the invisible God; there did He deign to dwell, Whom even
thrones cannot hold, and she bore Him as a light weight. Our hearts, O
Mary, are with thee. Like thy royal ancestor, David, "we will enter not
into the dwelling, our house, nor go up to bed whereon we lie, nor give
sleep to our eyes, nor rest to our temples," until we have found the place
in our hearts for the Lord Whom thou bearest, a tabernacle for this God of
Jacob. Then will be silenced the enemies of thy name, and nations will
offer thee their prayers.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Twentieth Day.


O Key of David and Sceptre of the house of Israel! Who openest and no man
shutteth; Who shuttest and no man openeth; come and lead the captive from
prison, sitting in darkness, and in the shadow of death. O Gabriel! blest
messenger of heaven, thou camest through closed doors, and didst announce
the word "Thou shalt conceive and bear a Son, and He shall be called
Emmanuel"! O Jesus, Son of David, heir to his throne and his power, Thou
art now passing over, on Thy way to Bethlehem, the land that once was the
kingdom of Thy ancestors, but now is tributary to the Gentiles. Not an
inch of this ground about Bethlehem, historic for many centuries, but has
witnessed the miracles of the justice and mercy of Jehovah, Thy Father, to
the people of that Old Covenant which is so soon to end. Before long, when
Thou hast come from beneath the virginal cloud which now hides Thee, Thou
wilt pass along this same road, doing good, healing all manner of sickness
and every infirmity; and yet having not whereon to lay Thy head. Thou art
now about to come forth, Thou art now to shine in the midst of this
world's darkness. Open the gates then, with this all powerful Key of
David.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Twenty-first Day.


Orient Splendor of eternal light, and Sun of justice! Come and enlighten
them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death. O Jesus, bright
light from heaven, the brightness of God Himself, the Splendor of the
early Sun: we welcome Thee. We need Thy light, for we sit in darkness: all
are in darkness who commit sin, and the world is full of sin. Jesus, the
great Sun, must rise over this darkness, that it may be dissipated, and a
new life may be infused into it; then the angel of darkness will fly away;
then will grow the life of light. Nothing prospers in darkness; man sleeps
and does not work, plants fade and die; so that, O Light of the splendid
Orient, arise in our hearts! We beseech Thee, O God, to remove from us all
that resists Thee, so that with a believing heart we may in such a manner
bring forth the branches of Thy gifts bestowed on us, that the root of
humility may never dry up within us.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Twenty-second Day.


O King of nations and their desired One, the corner-stone that joinest the
two walls! Come and save man, whom Thou didst form out of slime. O King of
peace! Thou wast born before all ages! come by the golden gate; visit
those whom Thou hast redeemed, and lead them back to the place from whence
they fell by sin. The journey of Our Lord to Bethlehem is nearly over, and
our blessed Mother is engrossed entirely in the expectation of the coming
of her divine Son. She adores His majesty; she gives thanks for His mercy;
she rejoices that she has been chosen for the sublime ministry of
motherhood towards the Son of God. Mary longs for that happy day when her
eyes will look upon Him, and yet she fears that moment, too. How will she
be able to serve her God in His human life? How will she dare to raise Him
up in her arms--the King of nations, and she but a humble Virgin? When she
reflects that the hour is approaching in which she is to see the Light of
the world, her heart almost fails her, for on the one hand she knows that
she bears her God, and on the other she is full of love because she is His
Mother. Come, then, speedily we beseech Thee, come and save us!

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Twenty-third Day.


O Emmanuel, Our King and Lawgiver, the expectation of the Gentiles and
their Saviour, come and save us, O Lord, Our God! O Jerusalem, city of the
great God! lift up thine eyes round about, and see thy Lord, for He is
coming to loose thee from thy chains. As Mary and Joseph passed Jerusalem
they surely did not omit to visit the Temple of the Lord. This was the
first visit which Our Lord paid to His Father's house. Then was fulfilled
for the first time the prophecy of Aggeus. "Great shall be the glory of
this last house, more than of the first." Now was standing in this second
Temple the Ark of the New Covenant, greater by far than the Ark of Moses.
The angels that lived in the Temple were roused to special prayer on that
occasion. Mary and Joseph, when their devotions were ended, hastened on
their way in order that they might seek suitable shelter, but they were to
be disappointed everywhere. Thus Jesus Christ, the Son of God, comes into
the world.

Prayer.

O Lord Jesus, Who didst, for the love of us, etc., etc.



Twenty-fourth Day.


Mary and Joseph arrived in Bethlehem. They knocked at several doors for
admittance or for information, but were invariably turned away; for great
was the crowd that was going the same way. The rich had their houses
engaged; the poor had to look for shelter in any place. Joseph, mindful of
Mary, his spouse, was much concerned for her comfort, and he did the best
he could. After great industry he at last found a cave where she might
have shelter from the open sky, and the darkness and chilliness of the
night. This holy eve is indeed full of grace and hope, and we ought to
spend it in spiritual communion and joy. Let us enter into the spirit of
the Church, and prepare ourselves in all the joy of our hearts to meet the
Saviour Who is about to be born to us. Let us dispose our hearts with
great simplicity, for to-morrow we shall see the glory of God. Let us
delight in the thought that before we lie down again to rest, we shall see
the promised Redeemer born in the solemn midnight: "Sanctify yourselves
to-day, and be prepared, because in the morning you shall see the majesty
of God among you."

Prayer.

O God, Who makest us to rejoice in the yearly expectation of the feast of
the redemption: grant that we, who joyfully receive Thy only-begotten Son
as a Redeemer, may behold without fear the same Lord Jesus Christ, coming
as our Judge: Who livest and reignest world without end. Amen.




Special Devotions to Mary, the Mother of Jesus, during the Time of Advent.


    The devotion of the forty Hail Marys, which St. Catharine of
    Bologna introduced, has been enriched by Pope Pius VII. An
    indulgence of forty days is granted to the faithful who recite it
    during the month of December.


Daily Prayer.

O Mary, great Mother of Our God, and merciful intercessor for us poor
sinners! we throw ourselves humbly at thy feet, and we beg thee by the
sacred blood of Thy divine Son, which He has shed for us, and by the
prayers of St. Catharine of Bologna, that thou wilt infuse into our hearts
the true spirit of devotion in this little exercise and give us the grace
to imitate the virtues of that saint, under whose protection we say this
prayer. Think not of our unworthiness and our ingratitude, but let us feel
the depth of thy great love for us; and in the contemplation of the love
with which thou didst consider thy servant Catharine, obtain for us from
God the remission of our sins, that we have a cause to expect the grace of
God for our salvation. Amen.

Prayer For Each Day.

Let us now take this devotion of this saint of God, Catharine, and every
day during this month before Christmas, say a prayer in preparation for
the coming of Christ, by reciting forty Hail Marys in honor of the great
Mother of God, who was so well prepared to receive the Lord at His birth.
We will have sorrow for our sins, for that will purify our souls, which is
a necessary quality for the reception of the Lord at His coming.

_The First Ten Hail Marys._

After each Hail Mary say:

"Blessed be the hour, O Mary, in which thou becamest the Mother of Jesus,
the Son of God."

Then consider the great mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God, the
greatest miracle of God's mercy, also the great dignity of Mary in the
Christian world and in heaven, because she became the Mother of God and
yet remained a Virgin.

_The Second Ten Hail Marys._

After each Hail Mary say:

"Blessed be the hour, O Mary, in which thou didst give birth to Jesus, the
Son of God."

Then consider the humility of Mary, the Queen of heaven, who was content
with the will of God and became the Mother of God in a lowly stable.

_The Third Ten Hail Marys._

After each Hail Mary say:

"Blessed be the hour, O Mary, in which thou didst nourish and care for the
Child Jesus."

Then consider the solicitude of Mary, with which she looked after the
Child Jesus in all the temporal necessities of a newly born infant, when,
according to His own will, He was not able to help Himself. She loved that
Child, and spent upon it her tenderest care.

_The Fourth Ten Hail Marys._

After each Hail Mary say:

"Blessed be the hour, O Mary, in which thou didst screen Jesus, the Son of
God, from the persecution of Herod."

Consider here that as soon as Jesus was born He became the object of the
persecution of men. Herod sought to murder Him, and Mary had to take the
Child and flee into Egypt.

Daily Prayer After These Devotions.

Praised be God, that we have undertaken this devotion according to the
instruction of St. Catharine. We beg of thee, Mary, Mother of the expected
Child, and Queen of angels, that thou deignest to obtain for us especially
two graces. First, to really bewail our sins and our past infidelities,
and second to attain after our death eternal salvation. We will cry out
from the bottom of our heart according to the example of Catharine: "Turn
then, Mary, thine eyes of mercy towards us, and after this, our exile,
show us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O blessed, O pious, O sweet
Virgin Mary!"

Then recite the Litany of the Blessed Virgin.(1)

_V._ Make us worthy to praise thee, O Blessed Virgin, Mother of my God.

_R._ That I may have power against my enemies.

_Let Us Pray._

O God, Who, after the announcement of the angel, didst create a body for
Thy divine Son in the bosom of the Blessed Virgin Mary, grant us the grace
that we, who acknowledge her great privilege, may be assisted by her
intercession. We pray Thee, O God almighty, that Thou mayest purify our
hearts and consciences by Thy heavenly visitation, that Thy divine Son
Jesus Christ, when He shall come with all the saints, may find a fitting
habitation prepared for Him. Who livest and reignest, one God, world
without end. Amen.




Mass for Advent.


In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

Introibo.

O Jesus, the true and infinite sacrifice, I adore Thee in the Blessed
Sacrament, and I make an offering of Thy sacred body, which Thou didst
deliver for us unto death on the cross, and Thy sacred blood, which Thou
didst shed for our sins, in union with the priest who is about to say
Mass. Eternal and merciful Father, the Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ, as
well as Our Father! With the priest I offer Thee a pure, holy, immaculate
sacrifice, the sacred bread of eternal life, the chalice of salvation, the
body and blood of Jesus Christ, Thy Son. Deign to accept it, and be
merciful to me a sinner. In the spirit of humility and with a contrite
heart, I acknowledge, O my God, that I have sinned often and grievously in
thought, word, and deed, through my most grievous fault. I know I have
been guilty, and I beg pardon of Thee, O heavenly Father, through Thy
infinite mercy, through the infinite merits of Jesus Christ, and through
the intercession of all the saints. Amen.

The Priest Ascends The Altar.

O ye saints whose relics are kept on the altar, and all ye saints and
servants of God in heaven, let me unite with thee in praising, loving and
adoring Our God in the Sacrament of the Altar! Pray for all those who are
assembled here; pray that we may be heard and that we ourselves cry out,
"Lord, have mercy on us! Christ, have mercy on us! Lord, have mercy on
us!" Amen.

Gloria.

Glory to God in the highest! Glory, praise, and adoration to the Most
High, the one true God, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
be for all eternity. Lord God, upon Thee I place all my trust. Save me
from every danger, and keep me from every evil. The eyes of all are upon
Thee, O Lord, and Thou givest them food; Thou fillest all that there is
with Thy benediction. I praise thee, also, O Mary, Mother of God, and
thank thee for all that I owe thee. Who is it Whom we adore in the Blessed
Sacrament but Jesus, thy Son, Who took flesh and blood from thee! What a
joy must not thy heart experience when thou seest so many devout
worshippers surrounding the throne of the majesty of Jesus, hidden in the
consecrated bread on our altars! Do thou also, O dear Mother, sing with us
the praises of that Jesus, for Whose coming we are preparing during
Advent. Amen.

Collects.

Give us, O God, the grace daily to feel the advent of Our Lord upon our
altars, as we expect Him to be born in our hearts at Christmas-time. Grant
that we may also be prepared to meet Him, the Judge, at the end of time,
and may find Him propitious; through the same Jesus Christ Our Lord. O
God, Who didst leave with us, under the consecrated species, a memory of
Thy sufferings, give us the grace that by our ardent faith we may adore
Thee in this Holy Sacrament, and become worthy fruits of Thy holy Passion
and death. Amen.

Epistle.

Accept, O God, this holy sacrifice in thanksgiving for the institution of
the Blessed Sacrament. For in possessing the Blessed Sacrament we possess
heaven and earth, our cares are taken away, and we have Jesus, Who cries
continually to us: "Come to Me, all you who are heavily laden, and I will
refresh you." My dear Jesus, make me worthy to praise Thee with all the
angels and elect in Thy kingdom. Let me serve Thee worthily here on this
earth, so that I may one day share Thy glory in heaven. Amen.

Gospel.

Jesus, divine Physician of our souls! how can we sufficiently thank Thee
for having become man, and for having dwelt among men? To perpetuate Thy
coming, Thou hast remained on our altars in the Holy Sacrament. Thou hast
preached the Gospel to us poor creatures, and hast made us acquainted with
the secrets of heaven. Oh, that we would always listen to Thy Word, and
apply it to our life, regulating all our actions on the principles of
divine wisdom manifested therein! Let Thy holy Gospel and Thy holy
teaching be a light to our lives in the darkness in which we walk, on
account of our prejudices, passions, and evil inclinations, and when we
take this light for our guide, we are sure that we will come happily to
the end for which we were created. Amen.

Credo.

I believe in one God, and in three divine persons in that Godhead. I
believe in one God, the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of
all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-
begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God of God, Light
of light, true God of true God, begotten, not made; consubstantial with
the Father by Whom all things were made, Who for us men, and for our
salvation, came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of
the Virgin Mary and was made man! He was crucified also for us, suffered
under Pontius Pilate, and was buried. The third day He rose again
according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven and sitteth at the
right hand of the Father: and He is to come again with glory to judge both
the living and the dead: of His kingdom there shall be no end. And I
believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from
the Father and the Son: Who together with the Father and the Son is adored
and glorified: Who spoke by the prophets. And one holy Catholic and
Apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the remission of sins, and I
expect the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.
Amen.

Offertory.

I adore Thee, O my God, and in union with the priest, offer Thee this
sacrifice for Thy honor and glory, in thanksgiving for all the benefits
conferred upon myself and upon the world; and in satisfaction for my many
sins, and the sins of other men. Accept, O Lord, of this holocaust, which
is no other than Thy divine Son, at once made Priest and Victim, offering
and offered, and apply His saving merits to my needy soul. Be comforted, O
my heart, Jesus sacrifices Himself for thee. Amen.

Lavabo.

O my Jesus, would that I could take Thee to witness of the holiness of my
life and the innocence of my heart! But it is in Thy mercy only that I
place all my hope; my consolation is in meditating on Thy promises to the
penitent heart, and Thy faithfulness in performing them. Confounded at all
that I have committed to this day, and encouraged by the favors Thou hast
bestowed upon me, I can but promise to correspond better with Thy graces
than I have hitherto done. I will purify myself more and more with the
tears of penance; I will bless Thee as I do this day, and I will sing of
the wonders of Thy power and of Thy mercy. Amen.

Orate Fratres.

The creature can offer nothing to the Creator that can be worthy of His
acceptance. I unite myself, therefore, to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
Who alone can merit anything in my behalf. I desire nothing but through
Him and with Him. I have no wish beyond Him. O God of mercy, I seek
nothing but Thy love! Graciously accept of the sacrifice of my heart and
my whole self and may it, like the sacrifice of Jesus, be pleasing to Thee
and unite us to Him. Amen.

Preface.

Lift up, O Lord, do Thou Thyself lift up my heart to Thee! Take from it
all unholy thoughts, all earthly affections! Lift it wholly up to heaven,
where Thou art worthily adored, and to the altar, where Thou art about to
manifest Thyself to me. My life is but one continual succession of Thy
mercies; let it be one continual succession of thanksgivings. And as Thou
art now about to renew the greatest of all sacrifices, is it not meet that
I should burst forth into expressions of heartfelt gratitude? Suffer me,
then, to join my feeble voice with the voices of all the heavenly spirits,
and in union with them, say, in a transport of joy and admiration: Holy,
holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth; heaven and earth are full of Thy glory.
Hosanna in the highest! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!
Hosanna in the highest! Amen.

Consecration.

Bow down your body and soul in solemn adoration; make an act of faith in
the real presence of your Saviour's body and blood, soul and divinity,
under the sacramental veils. Offer your whole self to Him, and through Him
to His Father; beg that your heart and soul may be happily changed into
Him.

Elevation Of The Host.

(_Here the bell is rung thrice._)

Hail, true body, born of the Virgin Mary, which didst truly suffer and was
immolated on the cross for man, Whose side was pierced, and from which
flowed water and blood; may we have a foretaste of Thee in the last agony
of death. O kind, O loving One, Jesus, Son of Mary, have mercy on me!
Amen.

Elevation Of The Chalice.

Saviour of the world, save us, for by Thy cross and by Thy blood Thou hast
redeemed us! Help us, we beseech Thee, O Our God! Amen. Have mercy on me,
dear Jesus, and grant that Thy blood may not be shed in vain for me, I
humbly beseech Thee. Amen.

Pater Noster.

Our Father, Who reignest in heaven, come and reign in my soul; come and
sanctify it by Thy presence; come and subject it to Thy holy will, and
render it obedient to the inspirations of Thy grace. Extinguish in my
heart every feeling of hatred and revenge; forgive me, as I forgive. Grant
me such wisdom and such strength that I may triumph over all temptations.
Deliver me from all those evils which oppress me, and under which I groan,
being burdened. I come to Thee as a child to his father to be fed; as a
subject to his prince to be protected; as one afflicted to his only
succor, to be consoled and comforted. Amen.

Agnus Dei.

In saying to Thy apostles, "Peace I leave to you, My peace I give to you,"
Thou hast promised, O Lord, to all Thy Church, that peace which the world
cannot give--peace with Thee, and peace with ourselves. Let nothing, O
Lord, ever interrupt this holy peace; let nothing separate us from Thee,
to Whom we heartily desire to be united, through the Blessed Sacrament of
peace and reconciliation. Let this food of angels strengthen us in every
Christian duty, so that we nevermore yield under temptations, or fall into
common weaknesses.

Domine, Non Sum Dignus.

God can only be worthy of receiving God; how, then, can a soul so sinful
as mine merit so great a happiness! But Thou, O Lord, regardest not Thy
greatness, but Thy mercy. Thou willest that I come to Thee, as one sick to
a physician who can heal him; as one poor to his rich lord who can assist.
O God of love, behold at Thy feet the poorest, the most infirm of Thy
creatures. Unite me to Thyself, and I shall become rich and whole in Thy
sight. Work, I beseech Thee, this miracle, worthy of Thy omnipotence and
charity.

Act Of Spiritual Communion.

_For Those Who do not Intend to Communicate._

O my most loving Saviour, since I cannot have the happiness of receiving
Thee this day, suffer me to gather up the precious crumbs that fall from
Thy table, and to unite myself to Thy divine Heart by faith, hope, and
charity. I confess I do not deserve the children's bread; but I venture
humbly to declare that, away from Thee, my soul is dried up with thirst,
and my heart cast down with faintness. Come, then, into me, O my divine
Jesus! come into my mind, to illuminate it with Thy light; come into my
heart, to enkindle in it the fire of Thy love, and to unite it so
intimately with Thine own, that it may be no more I that live, but Thou
that livest in me and reignest in me forever.

Last Gospel.

O eternal Word, speak to my soul, which adores Thee in profound silence!
Thou Who art the great Creator of all things, abandon not, I beseech Thee,
Thine own creature! be Thou my life, my light, and my all! O Light
eternal! enlighten me as to this present life, and in the life to come.
Reign in me as in Thine own inheritance; for Thou, O Lord, hast made me;
Thou hast redeemed me. May I ever be Thine!

After Mass.

Accept, O most gracious God, this, our service; whatever, by Thy grace, we
may have performed with diligence, in Thy clemency regard; and what we
have done with negligence, mercifully pardon, through Jesus Christ Our
Lord. Amen. May the blessing of almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
descend upon us now, and remain with us forever. Amen.




To Be Said Throughout Advent.


Ant. The Holy Ghost shall come down upon thee, O Mary: fear not: thou
shalt bear within thy womb the Son of God. Alleluia.

_V._ O Lord, hear my prayer.

_R._ And let my cry come unto Thee.

_Let Us Pray._

O God, Who wast pleased that Thy Word should take flesh in the womb of the
Blessed Virgin Mary, and didst make it known unto her by the message of an
angel; grant that we, Thy suppliants, who truly believe her to be the
Mother of God, may through her intercession find help with Thee. Through
the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

(_To be Said Every Day._)

O most pure Virgin, conceived without sin, and from that very first
instant entirely beautiful and without spot, O glorious Mary, full of
grace, and Mother of my God, Queen of angels and of men, I humbly worship
thee as Mother of my Saviour. Inasmuch as God has taught me by the esteem
He has for thee, and by His respect and submission towards thee, what
honors and homage I ought to render thee, deign, I beseech thee, to accept
this novena which I consecrate to thee. Thou art the secure refuge of
penitent sinners, and I therefore may rightly have recourse to thee; thou
art the Mother of mercy, and therefore thou canst not but be melted into
tenderness by my miseries; thou, after Jesus Christ, art all my hope; thou
canst not, then, but be pleased with the tender confidence which I have in
thee. Make me worthy to be called thy child, that I may be able to say
with confidence, Show thyself to be a Mother.


    Following this prayer on each day, nine Hail Marys and a Glory be
    to the Father are to be said, and then the following:


First Day.

Behold me at thy most holy feet, O immaculate Virgin. I rejoice with thee
exceedingly that from all eternity thou hast been chosen to be the Mother
of the eternal Word, and been preserved from original sin. I thank and
bless the most Holy Trinity for having enriched thee with these privileges
in thy conception; and I humbly implore thee to obtain for me grace to
overcome those sad effects which original sin has wrought in me. Ah, do
thou enable me to conquer them, and nevermore to cease to love my God.

the perfect use of reason was conferred upon thee. I thank and adore the
most Holy Trinity for having imparted to thee graces so sublime; and I am
utterly confounded before thee to see myself so poor in grace. Do thou,
who wast so entirely filled with heavenly grace, give some portion of it
to my soul, and make me a partaker of the treasures of thy immaculate
conception.

praise with all my heart the most Holy Trinity for having granted to thee
such a privilege; and I implore thee to obtain for me courage to overcome
every device of the infernal enemy, and not to stain my soul with sin. Ah,
do thou always assist me; and let me, under thy protection, ever triumph
over the common enemies of our eternal salvation.

to see that the most sublime and perfect virtues have been from thy first
conception infused into thee, and with them all the gifts of the Holy
Spirit. I thank and praise the most Holy Trinity for having favored thee
with these privileges; and I implore thee, O gracious Mother, to obtain
for me the practice of virtues, and to render me thus worthy to receive
the gifts and the grace of the Holy Spirit.


    Here the Litany or the Hymn is to be said.

most Holy Trinity for having so exalted and glorified thy person; and I
implore thee to obtain for me grace to know how to profit by the Passion

unavailing for me, but that I may live holily and be saved.

one day into a participation of that joy, and may be able, in the company
of the angels, to praise and bless thee for eternity.

Seventh Day.

Come, O Holy Spirit, etc.

O most pure Virgin, etc.

O immaculate Mary, rising morn of purity, I rejoice with thee, and am glad
that in the moment of thy conception thou wast confirmed in grace and made
incapable of sin. I thank and extol the most Holy Trinity for having
distinguished thee alone with this special privilege. Ah, obtain for me, O
holy Virgin, an entire and constant abhorrence of sin above every other
evil, and that I may sooner die than commit it any more.


    Here the Litany or the Hymn is to be said.


Eighth Day.

Come, O Holy Spirit, etc.

O most pure Virgin, etc.

O Virgin Mary, sun without spot, I congratulate thee, and rejoice that in
thy conception a greater and more abundant grace was bestowed upon thee
than all the angels and saints possessed in the fulness of their merits. I
thank and admire the sovereign goodness of the most Holy Trinity in having
enriched thee with this privilege. Ah, enable me to correspond to divine
grace, and nevermore abuse it! Change my heart, and let me from this
moment begin to amend my life.

purity, thou, when scarcely yet conceived, didst profoundly adore God and
thank Him, because by thy means, the ancient curse being taken away, the
fulness of blessing was coming upon the children of Adam. Ah, let this
blessing enkindle in my heart a love of God! Do thou inflame it, that I
may love Him constantly, and then enjoy Him eternally in paradise, where I
may be able to thank Him more ardently for the singular privileges granted
to thee, and behold thee also crowned as thou art with such exceeding
glory.


    Here the Litany or the Hymn is to be said.

Word.

Glory be to the Father, etc.

Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.
Laudamus te. Benedicimus te. Adoramus te. Glorificamus te. Gratias agimus
tibi propter magnam gloriam tuam: Domine Deus, Rex coelestis, Deus Pater
omnipotens. Domine Fili unigenite, Jesu Christe; Domine Deus, Agnus Dei,
Filius Patris: qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis. Qui tollis
peccata mundi, suscipe deprecationem nostram. Qui sedes ad dexteram
Patris, miserere nobis. Quoniam tu solus sanctus: tu solus Dominus: tu
solus altissimus, Jesu Christe; cum Sancto Spiritu in gloria Dei Patris.
Amen.

thanks for Thy great glory, O Lord God, heavenly King, God the Father
almighty. O Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son; O Lord God, Lamb of
God, Son of the Father. Who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy
on us. Who takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayers. Who
sittest at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For Thou only

    Then follow the _Collects_, prayers proper for the feast or
    season. The following is from the Mass of the most Holy Trinity,
    as are all the varying prayers and Scripture texts that occur
    henceforth in this Mass.


_Let Us Pray._

O almighty and everlasting God, Who hast granted Thy servants, in the
confession of the true faith, to acknowledge the glory of an eternal
Trinity, and in the power of majesty to adore a Unity: we beseech Thee
that, by the strength of this faith, we may be defended from all
adversity. Through Our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth
with Thee in the union of the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end.
Amen.

_Let Us Pray._

Preserve us, O Lord, we beseech Thee, from all dangers of body and soul;
and by the intercession of the glorious and blessed Mary, ever virgin.
Mother of God, of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, of St. Joseph, and
all the saints, grant us, in Thy mercy, health and peace, that,
adversities and errors being removed, Thy Church may serve Thee with a
pure and undisturbed devotion. Through, etc.

Epistle.

(Rom. xi. 33-36.)

O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
incomprehensible are His judgments, and how unsearchable His ways! For who
hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been His counsellor? Or who
hath first given to Him, and recompense shall be made him. For of Him, and
by Him, and in Him are all things. To Him be glory forever.

_R._ Deo gratias!

(_R._ Thanks be to God!)

Gradual.

(Daniel iii.)

Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who beholdest the deep, and sittest on the
cherubim.

_V._ Blessed art Thou, O Lord, in the firmament of heaven, and worthy of
praise forever. Alleluia, Alleluia!


    At solemn Mass the deacon places the book of Gospels on the altar,
    and the celebrant blesses the incense. The deacon, with joined
    hands, says:


Munda cor meum, ac labia mea, omnipotens Deus, qui labia Isaiae prophetae
calculo mundasti ignito: ita me tua grata miseratione dignare mundare, ut
sanctum Evangelium tuum digne valeam nuntiare. Per Christum Dominum
nostrum. Amen.

(Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, Who didst cleanse the lips
of the prophet Isaias with a burning coal: vouchsafe so to cleanse me by
Thy gracious mercy that I may be able worthily to proclaim Thy holy
Gospel. Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.)


    Then he takes the book from the altar, and, kneeling before the
    priest, asks his blessing. The priest answers:


Dominus sit in corde tuo et in labiis tuis, ut digne et competenter
annunties Evangelium suum. Amen.

(The Lord be in thy heart and on thy lips, that thou mayest worthily and
in becoming manner announce His Gospel. Amen.)

_V._ Dominus vobiscum.

_R._ Et cum spiritu tuo.

Gospel.

(Matt. xxviii.)

At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: All power is given to Me in
heaven and on earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching
them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I
am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.

_R._ Laus tibi, Christe!

(_R._ Praise be to Thee, O Christ!)

The Nicene Creed.

Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, factorem coeli et terrae,
visibilium omnium, et invisibilium. Et in unum Dominum Jesum Christum,
Filium Dei unigenitum: et ex Patre natum ante omnia saecula: Deum de Deo,
lumen de lumine, Deum verum de Deo vero: genitum non factum,
consubstantialem Patri, per quem omnia facta sunt. Qui propter nos
homines, et propter nostram salutem descendit de coelis. Et incarnatus est
de Spiritu Sancto, ex Maria Virgine: _et homo factus est_. Crucifixus
etiam pro nobis, sub Pontio Pilato passus, et sepultus est. Et resurrexit
tertia die, secundum scripturas; et ascendit in coelum, sedet ad dexteram
Patris; et iterum venturus est cum gloria, judicare vivos et mortuos;
cujus regni non erit finis. Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et
vivificantem, qui ex Patre Filioque procedit; qui cum Patre et Filio simul
adoratur et conglorificatur; qui locutus est per prophetas. Et unam
sanctam Catholicam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam. Confiteor unum Baptisma in
remissionem peccatorum. Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum, et vitam
venturi saeculi. Amen.

(I believe in one God, the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and
of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the
only-begotten Son of God, and born of the Father before all ages: God of
God, light of light, true God of true God; begotten, not made;
consubstantial to the Father, by Whom all things were made. Who for us
men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and became incarnate by
the Holy Ghost, of the Virgin Mary, _and was made man_. He was crucified
also for us, suffered under Pontius Pilate, and was buried. And the third
day He arose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven,
sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and He is to come again with
glory to judge both the living and the dead; of Whose kingdom there shall
be no end. And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, Who
proceedeth from the Father and the Son; Who together with the Father and
the Son is adored and glorified; Who spoke by the prophets. And one holy
Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the remission of
sins, and I expect the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world
to come. Amen.)


    Turning to the people the priest says:


_V._ Dominus vobiscum.

(_V._ The Lord be with you.)

_R._ Et cum spiritu tuo.

(_R._ And with thy spirit.)

_V._ Oremus.

(_V._ Let us pray.)

Offertory.

Blessed be God the Father, and the only-begotten Son of God, as likewise
the Holy Ghost, for He has shown mercy to us.


    Offering up the Host, the priest says:


Suscipe, sancte Pater, omnipotens, aeterne Deus, hanc immaculatam Hostiam,
quam ego indignus famulus tuus offero tibi, Deo meo vivo et vero, pro
innumerabilibus peccatis, et offensionibus et negligentiis meis, et pro
omnibus circumstantibus; sed et pro omnibus fidelibus Christianis, vivis
atque defunctis; ut mihi et illis proficiat ad salutem, in vitam aeternam.
Amen.

(Accept, O holy Father, almighty and eternal God, this unspotted Host,
which I, Thy unworthy servant, offer unto Thee, my living and true God,
for my innumerable sins, offences, and negligences, and for all here
present; as also for all faithful Christians, both living and dead; that
it may avail both me and them unto life everlasting. Amen.)


    Pouring the water and wine into the chalice, he says:


Deus, qui humanae substantiae dignitatem mirabiliter condidisti, et
mirabilius reformasti: da nobis per hujus aquae et vini mysterium, ejus
divinitatis esse consortes, qui humanitatis nostrae fieri dignatus est
particeps, Jesus Christus, Filius tuus, Dominus noster: qui tecum vivit et
regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.

(O God, Who in creating human nature hast wonderfully dignified it, and
still more wonderfully reformed it: grant that by the mystery of this
water and wine we may be made partakers of His divine nature Who
vouchsafed to become partaker of our human nature: Jesus Christ, Thy Son,
Our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity, etc.)


    Offering the chalice, the priest says:


Offerimus tibi, Domine, calicem salutaris, tuam deprecantes clementiam, ut
in conspectu divinae majestatis tuae, pro nostra et totius mundi salute cum
odore suavitatis ascendat. Amen.

(We offer unto Thee, O Lord, the chalice of salvation, beseeching Thy
clemency that it may ascend before Thy divine majesty as a sweet odor for
our salvation and for that of the whole world. Amen.)


    Bowing down, the priest says:


In spiritu humilitatis et in animo contrito suscipiamur a te, Domine; et
sic fiat sacrificium nostrum in conspectu tuo hodie, ut placeat tibi,
Domine Deus.

(Accept us, O Lord, in the spirit of humility and contrition of heart; and
grant that the sacrifice we offer in Thy sight this day may be pleasing to
Thee, O Lord God.)


    Blessing the Host and chalice, the priest says:


Veni, sanctificator, omnipotens, aeterne Deus, et benedic hoc sacrificium
tuo sancto nomini praeparatum.

(Come, O almighty and eternal God, the sanctifier, and bless this
sacrifice, prepared for the glory of Thy holy name.)


    Going to the Epistle side of the altar, the priest washes his
    hands, and recites the following verses of


Psalm XXV.

Lavabo inter innocentes manus meas; et circumdabo altare tuum, Domine.

(I will wash my hands among the innocent; and will compass Thy altar, O
Lord.)

Ut audiam vocem laudis; et enarrem universa mirabilia tua.

(That I may hear the voice of Thy praise, and tell of all Thy wondrous
works.)

Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuae, et locum habitationis gloriae tuae.

(I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of Thy house, and the place where Thy
glory dwelleth.)

Ne perdas cum impiis Deus, animam meam, et cum viris sanguinum vitam meam.

(Take not away my soul with the wicked, nor my life with bloody men.)

In quorum manibus iniquitates sunt: dextera eorum repleta est muneribus.

(In whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is filled with gifts.)

Ego autem in innocentia mea ingressus sum: redime me, et miserere mei.

(But I have walked in my innocence: redeem me, and have mercy on me.)

Pes meus stetit in directo: in ecclesiis benedicam te, Domine.

(My foot has stood in the direct way; in the churches I will bless Thee, O
Lord.)

Gloria Patri, etc.

(Glory be to the Father, etc.)


    Returning and bowing before the middle of the altar, he says:


Suscipe, sancta Trinitas, hanc oblationem, quam tibi offerimus ob memoriam
Passionis, resurrectionis, et ascensionis Jesu Christi Domini nostri, et
in honorem beatae Mariae semper virginis, et beati Joannis Baptistae, et
sanctorum apostolorum Petri et Pauli, et istorum, et omnium sanctorum; ut
illis proficiat ad honorem, nobis autem ad salutem; et illi pro nobis
intercedere dignentur in coelis, quorum memoriam agimus in terris. Per
eundem Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

(Receive, O Holy Trinity, this oblation, which we make to Thee in memory
of the Passion, resurrection, and ascension of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and
in honor of the blessed Mary, ever virgin, of blessed John Baptist, the
holy apostles Peter and Paul, and of all the saints; that it may be
available to their honor and our salvation; and that they may vouchsafe to
intercede for us in heaven whose memory we celebrate on earth. Through the
same Christ Our Lord. Amen.)


    Turning towards the people, he says:


Orate, fratres, ut meum ac vestrum sacrificium acceptabile fiat apud Deum
Patrem omnipotentem.

(Brethren, pray that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the
Father almighty.)

_R._ Suscipiat Dominus sacrificium de manibus tuis ad laudem et gloriam
nominis sui, ad utilitatem quoque nostram, totiusque Ecclesiae suae sanctae.

(_R._ May the Lord receive the sacrifice from thy hands, to the praise and
glory of His name, to our benefit, and to that of all His holy Church.)


    The priest answers in a low voice, Amen. He then reads:


The Secret Prayers.

Sanctify, we beseech Thee, O Lord Our God, by the invocation of Thy holy
name, the victim of this oblation; and by it make us ourselves an eternal
offering to Thee. Through, etc.

Graciously hear us, O God Our Saviour, that by the virtue of this
sacrament Thou mayest defend us from all enemies, of both soul and body;
grant us grace in this life and glory in the next. Who livest and reignest
with God the Father, in the unity of the Holy Ghost.


    He concludes by saying aloud:


Per omnia saecula saeculorum.

(World without end.)

_R._ Amen.

(_R._ Amen.)

_V._ Dominus vobiscum.

_R._ Dignum et justum est.

(_R._ It is meet and just.)

The Preface.

Vere dignum et justum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper, et ubique
gratias agere, Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus. Qui cum
unigenito Filio tuo et Spiritu Sancto unus es Deus, unus es Dominus: non
in unius singularitate personae, sed in unius trinitate substantiae. Quod
enim de tua gloria, revelante te, credimus, hoc de Filio tuo, hoc de
Spiritu Sancto, sine differentia discretionis sentimus. Ut in confessione
verae sempiternaeque Deitatis, et in Personis proprietas, et in essentia
unitas, et in majestate adoretur aequalitas. Quam laudant angeli atque
archangeli, cherubim quoque ac seraphim, qui non cessant clamare quotidie,
una voce dicentes:

(It is truly meet and just, right and available to salvation, that we
should always and in all places give thanks to Thee, O holy Lord, Father
almighty, eternal God. Who together with Thy only-begotten Son and the
Holy Ghost art one God and one Lord: not in a singularity of one person,
but in a trinity of one substance. For what we believe of Thy glory, as
Thou hast revealed the same, we believe of Thy Son and of the Holy Ghost,
without any difference or distinction. So that in confession of the true
and eternal Deity we adore a distinction in the persons, and unity in the
essence, and an equality in the majesty. Whom the angels and archangels,
the cherubim also and seraphim, praise, and cease not daily to cry out
with one voice, saying:)

Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth. Pleni sunt coeli et terra
gloria tua. Hosanna in excelsis.

(Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of Thy
glory. Hosanna in the highest.)

Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini. Hosanna in excelsis.

(Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the
highest.)

The Canon of the Mass.

Te igitur, clementissime Pater, per Jesum Christum Filium tuum Dominum
nostrum, supplices rogamus ac petimus, uti accepta habeas, et benedicas,
haec dona, haec munera, haec sancta sacrificia illibata, imprimis quae tibi
offerimus pro Ecclesia tua sancta Catholica, quam pacificare, custodire,
adunare, et regere digneris toto orbe terrarum, una cum famulo tuo Papa
nostro N., et Antistite nostro N., et omnibus orthodoxis, atque Catholicae
et Apostolicae fidei cultoribus.

(We therefore humbly pray and beseech Thee, most merciful Father, through
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Our Lord, to accept and bless these gifts, these
presents, these holy unspotted sacrifices, which, in the first place, we
offer Thee for Thy holy Catholic Church, to which vouchsafe to grant
peace, as also to preserve, unite, and govern it throughout the world;
together with Thy servant N., our Pope, and our bishop N., as also all
orthodox believers and professors of the Catholic and apostolic faith.)

Commemoration of the Living.

Memento, Domine, famulorum famularumque tuarum, N. et N. Et omnium
circumstantium, quorum tibi fides cognita est et nota devotio, pro quibus
tibi offerimus, vel qui tibi offerunt hoc sacrificium laudis, pro se,
suisque omnibus, pro redemptione animarum suarum, pro spe salutis et
incolumitatis suae, tibique reddunt vota sua, aeterno Deo vivi et vero.

(Remember, O Lord, Thy servants of both sexes, N. and N. And all here
present whose faith and devotion are known unto Thee, for whom we offer,
or who offer up to Thee, this sacrifice of praise, for themselves, their
families, and friends, for the redemption of their souls, for the health
and salvation they hope for, and for which they now pay their vows to
Thee, the eternal, living, and true God.)

Communicantes, et memoriam venerantes, imprimis gloriosae semper Virginis
Mariae, Genitricis Dei et Domini nostri Jesu Christi: sed et beatorum
apostolorum ac martyrum tuorum, Petri et Pauli, Andreae, Jacobi, Joannis,
Thomae, Jacobi, Philippi, Bartholomaei, Matthaei, Simonis et Thaddaei: Lini,
Cleti, Clementis, Xysti, Cornelii, Cypriani, Laurentii, Chrysogoni,
Joannis et Pauli, Cosmae et Damiani, et omnium sanctorum tuorum: quorum
meritis precibusque concedas, ut in omnibus protectionis tuae muniamur
auxilio. Per eundem Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

(Communicating with, and honoring in the first place, the memory of the
ever-glorious Virgin Mary, Mother of Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, as
also of the blessed apostles and martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James,
John, Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon, and Thaddeus:
Linus, Cletus, Clement, Xystus, Cornelius, Cyprian, Lawrence, Chrysogonus,
John and Paul, Cosmas and Damian, and of all Thy saints, through whose
merits and prayers grant that we may be always defended by the help of Thy
protection. Through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.)

Hanc igitur oblationem servitutis nostrae, sed et cunctae familiae tuae,
quaesumus, Domine, ut placatus accipias; diesque nostros in tua pace
disponas, atque ab aeterna damnatione nos eripi, et in electorum tuorum
jubeas grege numerari. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

(We therefore beseech Thee, O Lord, graciously to accept this oblation of
our servitude, as also of Thy whole family, and to dispose of our days in
Thy peace; preserve us from eternal damnation, and rank us in the number
of Thine elect. Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.)

Quam oblationem tu, Deus, in omnibus, quaesumus, benedictam, adscriptam,
ratam, rationabilem, acceptabilemque facere digneris: ut nobis corpus et
sanguis fiat dilectissimi Filii tui Domini nostri Jesu Christi.

(Which oblation to Thou, O God, vouchsafe in all respects to bless,
approve, ratify, and accept, that it may be made for us the body and blood
of Thy most beloved Son, Jesus Christ Our Lord.)

The Consecration.

Qui pridie quam pateretur, accepit panem in sanctas ac venerabiles manus
suas, et elevatis oculis in coelum, ad te Deum Patrem suum omnipotentem,
tibi gratias agens, benedixit, fregit, deditque discipulis suis, dicens:
Accipite, et manducate ex hoc omnes: Hoc est enim corpus meum.

Simili modo postquam coenatum est, accipiens et hunc praeclarum calicem in
sanctas ac venerabiles manus suas, item tibi gratias agens, benedixit,
deditque discipulis suis, dicens: Accipite, et bibite ex eo omnes: Hic est
enim calix sanguinis mei, novi et aeterni testamenti: mysterium fidei: qui
pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum. Haec
quotiescunque feceritis, in mei memoriam facietis.


    After the consecration and elevation the priest proceeds:


Unde et memores, Domine, nos servi tui, sed et plebs tua sancta, ejusdem
Christi Filii tui Domini nostri tam beatae Passionis, necnon et ab inferis
resurrectionis, sed et in coelo gloriosae ascensionis, offerimus praeclarae
majestati tuae, de tuis donis ac datis, Hostiam puram, Hostiam sanctam,
Hostiam immaculatam, panem sanctum vitae aeternae, et calicem salutis
perpetuae.

(Wherefore, O Lord, we, Thy servants, as also Thy holy people, calling to
mind the blessed Passion of the same Christ, Thy Son, Our Lord, His
resurrection from the dead and admirable ascension into heaven, offer unto
Thy most excellent majesty, of Thy gifts bestowed, a pure Host, a holy
Host, an unspotted Host, the holy bread of eternal life, and chalice of
everlasting salvation.)

Supra quae propitio ac sereno vultu respicere digneris, et accepta habere,
sicuti accepta habere dignatus es munera pueri tui justi Abel, et
sacrificium Patriarchae nostri Abrahae, et quod tibi obtulit summus sacerdos
tuus Melchisedech, sanctum sacrificium immaculatam, hostiam.

(Upon which vouchsafe to look with a propitious and serene countenance,
and to accept them, as Thou wert graciously pleased to accept the gifts of
Thy just servant Abel, and the sacrifice of our patriarch Abraham, and
that which Thy high priest Melchisedech offered to Thee, a holy sacrifice
and an unspotted victim.)

Supplices te rogamus, omnipotens Deus, jube haec perferri per manus sancti
angeli tui in sublime altare tuum, in conspectu divinae majestatis tuae, ut
quotquot ex hac altaris participatione, sacro-sanctum Filii tui corpus et
sanguinem sumpserimus, omni benedictione coelesti, et gratia repleamur. Per
eundem Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

(Most humbly do we beseech Thee, almighty God, to command these things to
be carried by the hands of Thy holy angel to the altar on high, in sight
of Thy divine majesty, that as many as shall partake of the most sacred
body and blood of Thy Son at this altar may be filled with every heavenly
grace and blessing. Through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.)

Commemoration of the Dead.

Memento etiam, Domine, famulorum famularumque tuarum N. et N., qui nos
praecesserunt cum signo fidei, et dormiunt in somno pacis.

(Be mindful, O Lord, of Thy servants N. and N., who are gone before us
with the sign of faith, and rest in the sleep of peace.)


    Here the priest, with hands joined, prays for such of the dead as
    he wishes to pray for in particular. Then, extending his hands, he
    continues:


Ipsis, Domine, et omnibus in Christo quiescentibus, locum refrigerii,
lucis et pacis, ut indulgeas, deprecamur. Per eundem Christum Dominum
nostrum. Amen.

(To these, O Lord, and and to all that sleep in Christ, grant, we beseech
Thee, a place of refreshment, light, and peace. Through the same Christ
Our Lord. Amen.)

Nobis quoque, peccatoribus, famulis tuis, de multitudine miserationum
tuarum sperantibus, partem aliquam et societatem donare digneris cum tuis
sanctis apostolis et martyribus: cum Joanne, Stephano, Matthia, Barnaba,
Ignatio, Alexandro, Marcellino, Petro, Felicitate, Perpetua, Agatha,
Lucia, Agnete, Caecilia, Anastasia, et omnibus sanctis tuis: intra quorum
nos consortium, non aestimator meriti, sed veniae, quaesumus, largitor
admitte. Per Christum Dominum nostrum.

(Also to us sinners, Thy servants, confiding in the multitude of Thy
mercies, vouchsafe to grant some part and fellowship with Thy holy
apostles and martyrs: with John, Stephen, Matthias, Barnabas, Ignatius,
Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, Felicitas, Perpetua, Agatha, Lucia, Agnes,
Cecilia, Anastasia, and all Thy saints; into whose company we beseech Thee
to admit us, not in consideration of our merit, but of Thy own pardon.
Through Christ Our Lord.)

Per quem haec omnia, Domine, semper bona creas, sanctificas, vivificas,
benedicis et praestas nobis.

(By Whom, O Lord, Thou dost always create, bless, quicken, and give us all
these good things,)

Per ipsum, et cum ipso, et in ipso est tibi, Deo Patri omnipotenti, in
unitate Spiritus Sancti, omnis honor et gloria.

(By Him, and with Him, and in Him, is to Thee, God the Father almighty, in
the unity of the Holy Ghost, all honor and glory.)

Per omnia saecula saeculorum.

(Forever and ever.)

_R._ Amen.

(_R._ Amen.)

_Oremus._

(_Let us pray._)

The Pater Noster.

Praeceptis salutaribus moniti et divina institutione formati, audemus
dicere:

(Instructed by Thy saving precepts, and following Thy divine directions,
we presume to say:)

Pater noster, qui es in coelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum; adveniat regnum
tuum; fiat voluntas tua sicut in coelo et in terra. Panem nostrum
quotidianum da nobis hodie; et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos
dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.

(Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass
against us. And lead us not into temptation.)

Maria, cum beatis apostolis tuis Petro et Paulo, atque Andrea, et omnibus
sanctis, da propitius pacem in diebus nostris: ut ope misericordiae tuae
adjuti, et a peccato simus semper liberi, et ab omni perturbatione securi.
Per eundem Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et
regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus: per omnia saecula saeculorum.

virgin, Mother of God, and of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, and
Andrew, and of all the saints, mercifully grant peace in our days, that

Christi fiat accipientibus nobis in vitam aeternam. Amen.

(May this mixture and consecration of the body and blood of Our Lord Jesus
Christ be to us who receive it effectual to eternal life. Amen.)


    The priest strikes his breast three times, saying:


Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi: miserere nobis.

(Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of the world: have mercy on us.)

    eis requiem, Grant them rest_; and instead of _Dona nobis pacem_
    is said: _Dona eis requiem sempiternam, Grant them eternal rest_.
    The priest does not strike his breast, nor does he say the first
    of the following prayers:


Domine Jesu Christe, qui dixisti apostolis tuis: Pacem relinquo vobis,
pacem meam do vobis, ne respicias peccata mea, sed fidem Ecclesiae tuae,
eamque secundum voluntatem tuam pacificare et coadunare digneris. Qui
vivis et regnas, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.

(Lord Jesus Christ, Who saidst to Thy apostles, I leave you peace, I give
you My peace: regard not my sins, but the faith of Thy Church, and grant
her that peace and unity which is agreeable to Thy will. Who livest and
reignest forever and ever. Amen.)

Domine Jesu Christe, Fili Dei vivi, qui ex voluntate Patris, co-operante
Spiritu Sancto, per mortem tuam mundum vivificasti, libera me per hoc
sacro-sanctum corpus et sanguinem tuum ab omnibus iniquitatibus meis, et
universis malis: et fac me tuis semper inhaerere mandatis, et a te nunquam
separari permittas. Qui cum eodem Deo Patre et Spiritu Sancto vivis et
regnas, Deus, in saecula saeculorum. Amen.

(Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, Who, according to the will of
Thy Father, hast by Thy death, through the cooperation of the Holy Ghost,
given life to the world: deliver me by this, Thy most sacred body and
blood from all my iniquities, and from all evils; and make me always
adhere to Thy commandments; and never suffer me to be separated from Thee.
Who livest and reignest with God the Father in the unity of the Holy
Ghost, God, forever and ever. Amen.)

Perceptio corporis tui, Domine Jesu Christe, quod ego indignus sumere
praesumo, non mihi proveniat in judicium et condemnationem, sed pro tua
pietate prosit mihi ad tutamentum mentis et corporis, et ad medelam
percipiendam. Qui vivis et regnas cum Deo Patre in unitate Spiritus
Sancti, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.

(Grant that the participation of Thy body, O Lord Jesus Christ, which I,
though unworthy, presume to receive, may not turn to my judgment and
condemnation, but through Thy mercy be a safeguard and remedy, both to
soul and body. Who livest and reignest with God the Father in the unity of
the Holy Ghost, God, forever and ever. Amen.)


    Taking the Host in his hands, and making a genuflection, he says:


Panem coelestem accipiam, et nomen Domini invocabo.

(I will take the heavenly bread, and call on the name of the Lord.)


    Striking his breast with humility and devotion, the priest says
    thrice:


Domine, non sum dignus ut intres sub tectum meum; sed tantum dic verbo, et
sanabitur anima mea.

(Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof: say but the
word, and my soul shall be healed.)


    Before receiving the sacred Host he says:


Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat animam meam in vitam aeternam.
Amen.

(May the body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve my soul to life
everlasting. Amen.)


    After receiving the sacred Host:


Quid retribuam Domino pro omnibus quae retribuit mihi? Calicem salutaris
accipiam, et nomen Domini invocabo. Laudans invocabo Dominum, et ab
inimicis meis salvus ero.

(What return shall I make the Lord for all He has given to me? I will take
the chalice of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. Praising, I
will call upon the Lord, and shall be saved from my enemies.)


    Before receiving the sacred blood:


Sanguis Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat animam meam in vitam aeternam.
Amen.

(May the blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve my soul to life
everlasting. Amen.)

fiat nobis remedium sempiternum.

(Grant, O Lord, that what we have taken with our mouth we may receive with
a pure mind; that of a temporal gift it may become to us an eternal
remedy.)


    At the ablution:


Corpus tuum, Domine, quod sumpsi, et sanguis quem potavi, adhaereat
visceribus meis: et praesta, ut in me non remaneat scelerum macula, quem
pura et sancta refecerunt sacramenta. Qui vivis et regnas in saecula
saeculorum. Amen.

(May Thy body, O Lord, which I have received, and Thy blood, which I
drank, cleave to my bowels; and grant that no stain of sin may remain in
me, who have been refreshed with pure and holy sacraments. Who livest and
reignest forever. Amen.)

acceptabile, mihique et omnibus pro quibus illud obtuli sit, te miserante,
propitiabile. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

(Let the performance of my homage be pleasing to Thee, O Holy Trinity; and
grant that the sacrifice which I, unworthy as I am, have offered up in the
sight of Thy majesty, may be acceptable to Thee, and by Thy mercy be a
propitiation for me and for all for whom I have offered it. Through Christ
Our Lord. Amen.)

In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum.
Hoc erat in principio apud Deum. Omnia per ipsum facta sunt, et sine ipso
factum est nihil quod factum est. In ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux
hominum; et lux in tenebris lucet, et tenebrae eam non comprehenderunt.

(In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by
Him: and without Him was made nothing that was made. In Him was life, and
the life was the light of men: and the light shineth in darkness, and the
darkness did not comprehend it.)

Fuit homo missus a Deo, cui nomen erat Joannes. Hic venit in testimonium,
ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine, ut omnes crederent per illum. Non
erat ille lux; sed ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine. Erat lux vera quae
illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum. In mundo erat, et mundus
per ipsum factus est, et mundus eum non cognovit. In propria venit, et sui
eum non receperunt. Quotquot autem receperunt eum, dedit eis potestatem
filios Dei fieri; his qui credunt in nomine ejus, qui non ex sanguinibus,
neque ex voluntate carnis, neque ex voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt.
ET VERBUM CARO FACTUM EST, et habitavit in nobis: et vidimus gloriam ejus,
gloriam quasi unigeniti a Patre, plenum gratiae et veritatis.

(There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a
witness to give testimony of the light, that all might believe through
him. He was not the light, but came to give testimony of the light. That
was the true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this
world. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world
knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as
many as received Him, to them He gave power to be made the sons of God; to
them that believe in His name, who are born, not of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. AND THE WORD WAS MADE
FLESH, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, as it were the glory of
the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.)

_R._ Deo gratias.

(_R._ Thanks be to God.)

Who, from the darksome womb of night,
Broughtst forth new light at nature's birth,
To shine upon the face of earth.)

Hast measured time and called it day,

Vouchsafe to hear our prayers and tears.)

Dum nil perenne cogitat,
Seseque culpis illigat.

From gifts of life should be exiled,
Whilst on no heavenly thing she thinks,
But twines herself in Satan's links.)

A Prayer For Sincere Contrition.

I have now, O my God! aided by Thy grace, endeavored to discover the
number of my transgressions, and have examined, to the best of my power,
the state of my conscience. But, alas! O Judge of the living and the dead!
how far different is my judgment from Thine! How many offences are still
perhaps hidden from my view, though perfectly known to Thee! But, my God!
as I am persuaded it is not so much a knowledge of their number, as sorrow
for their deformity, that Thou requirest, I now earnestly implore of Thee
to give me that lively, sincere, efficacious contrition, which I know is a
necessary condition of my pardon. My heart was formed by Thee, Thou alone
canst change it; it is in Thy hands, and though most ungrateful, most
insensible, it is not too obdurate for Thee to penetrate and soften. One
drop of Thy adorable blood, one of those precious tears which my offences
drew from Thy eyes, would suffice to produce in my soul the most lively
contrition. Ah! look on me, eternal Light! and my understanding will be
enlightened to conceive the enormity of sin; touch my heart, and it will
be broken with sorrow for having ever offended Thee. Convert me, and I
shall be converted; for my destruction, my misery, and my misfortune, is
from myself, but my salvation must come from Thee, O my most merciful
Father! from Thee, Whom I have so ungratefully abandoned, and so
grievously offended.

Act of Contrition For Those Who Are Guilty of Mortal Sin.

O infinite majesty of my God! I am so full of shame at the sight of the
ingratitude and malice of which I find myself guilty before Thee, that I
dare not raise my eyes to heaven. I confess, O most gracious and merciful
Lord, that by the multitude and enormity of my sins I have deserved to be
abandoned by Thee, and condemned to eternal torments. Ah, unhappy being
that I am, how can I have dared to offend Thee! Can it be, O my Saviour,
that I have trampled under foot Thy blood, by which I was redeemed; and
that I have thus renewed the pains of Thy Passion and of Thy death! Ah,
why, why did I not die at once, rather than displease Thee! How could I
dare to offend against Thee, Who art infinite goodness, wisdom, and
beauty!... Thee, Who art perfection itself!... Thee, Who art my God, my
Creator, my beginning, my end, my happiness, my all!... Thee, from Whom I
have received my being, my life, and all that I am!... Thee, Who hast
guided and protected me with the tenderest love under the shadow of Thy
wings!... Thee, Who hast adopted me for Thy child, and made me heir to Thy
eternal kingdom!... Thee, Who hast redeemed me by Thy most precious blood,
and hast so often nourished me with Thy most sacred body and blood in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist! And yet, notwithstanding these, Thy great and
manifold blessings, I have offended Thee, O my God! I have abandoned Thee,
to league with Thy enemies against Thee. I have preferred a vile
gratification to Thy love. Oh, ingratitude! Oh, delusion! Oh, madness! Ah,
when shall I detest my sins as much as they deserve! O my sweet and
merciful Lord Jesus, of Whose goodness there is no end, and of Whose mercy
the treasure is infinite, have pity on me, and save my soul! Pardon me, O
most bountiful Lord, pardon me, I entreat Thee, by the merit of Thy bitter
Passion and death! Remember not my iniquities, but regard Thy infinite
mercy. I promise that, by the help of Thy grace, I will never fall into
them again. From this very moment I break all the ties that bind me to the
world, to the flesh, to the devil, and to sin. I am from this moment
firmly resolved to trample under foot all worldly vanities, and to
consecrate myself entirely to Thy holy love. Oh, never allow me to fall
back into my old habits of sin! Never permit that honors, or interest, or
pleasure, or pride, or the love of life, or the fear of death, or any
other motive, shall cause me to swerve from Thy divine commands. Grant
that I may keep them with my whole heart, though it should cost me the
sacrifice of my life, and of all I hold dearest in the world.

Ah, what has been my folly and my wickedness in having so often and so
grievously offended my God, my heavenly Father, my gracious and loving
Redeemer! What ingratitude, what an excess of malice! At the very moment I
was receiving with one hand the greatest favors and graces from this my
most tender and merciful Lord, with the other I was plunging a dagger into
His bosom--I was crucifying Him again within my soul! I have sold myself to
the devil for a worthless pleasure; I have renounced the kingdom of heaven
and all the joys of paradise for a trifling enjoyment; I have signed the
decree for my eternal damnation to gratify my pride; I have condemned
myself to suffer an eternity of torments and all the agonies of hell, to
indulge an unworthy passion! Ah, who will give to my eyes a fountain of
tears, that I may weep and lament over my sins!

O my divine Redeemer, Whose love I have unhappily despised, Whose blood I
have trodden under foot, Whose wounds I have reopened, and Whose death I
have renewed by my sins! How can I present myself before Thee after so
great an excess of ingratitude and malice! O my gracious Saviour, what
hadst Thou done to me that I should treat Thee so cruelly! Thou hast
reconciled me to Thy Father by Thy death, and I have again drawn down upon
myself His indignation by repeated sins. Thou hast snatched me from the
slavery of the devil, and I have again entangled myself in his snares.
Thou hast healed my wounds, and I have inflicted fresh ones on myself.
Thou hast delivered me from the eternal flames of hell, to which I was
condemned by my sins, and I have cast myself into them again. Thou hast
obtained heaven for me, and I have sold the right which Thou didst
purchase at the price of Thy blood, for a trifling pleasure, for a
corruptible crown. Is it possible to conceive folly, stupidity, malice,
equal to mine! I confess it here before Thee, O Lord; I detest it from the
depths of my soul; and resolve to die a thousand times rather than fall
again into it. Ah, wilt Thou reject a contrite and humble sinner, when
Thou didst come down from heaven to call sinners to repentance? Wilt Thou
refuse to receive this strayed sheep which returns from his wanderings,
after Thou hast sought him so long, to bring him back to the fold? Wilt
Thou reject this prodigal child, who comes to throw himself at Thy feet,
after Thou hast so much grieved over his loss? Wilt Thou leave me forever
to groan under the insupportable weight of sin, when Thou didst invite all
those who are burdened to cast their load at Thy feet? Thou didst absolve
the sinful woman when, kneeling before Thee, she implored Thy mercy; Thou
didst remit the sins of the publican when he humbled himself in Thy
Temple; Thou didst pardon the good thief when he acknowledged Thy power on
the cross; and shall I be the only one to whom Thou wilt refuse grace? No,
my adorable Saviour, not so. I trust that, however unworthy I have made
myself of pardon, yet Thou wilt grant it to me, and that Thy precious
blood will appease Thy Father's wrath against me, and wash away the stain
of my sins. Offer it, then, to Him for me, O Lord, and apply it so
effectually to me that I may be entirely cleansed, and may be judged
worthy to enter into the blessed mansions, where nothing defiled can be
admitted. Amen.

Act Of Contrition For Venial Sin.

Prostrate at Thy feet, O Lord, I ask Thy pardon for all the failings and
negligences which my frailty, my ignorance, and my malice have caused me
to commit against Thy infinite majesty, especially for all those which I
have perpetrated since my last confession. I am confounded, Lord, when I
remember their number, and how much I have displeased and offended Thee by
them. Ah, how little do I love Thee! how little do I love my neighbor!
With what coldness, with what cowardice have I attended to Thy service!
How much on the contrary have I yielded to self-love, and how much I still
retain of affection for creatures! Oh, how rarely do I enter into myself,
and think seriously of Thee! How filled with distractions are my prayers,
my meditations, and all my exercises of devotion! How much vanity enters
into all my actions! how much attachment to my own will, my own ease, and
my own convenience! Ah, Lord, draw me, I entreat Thee, out of the abyss of
my misery, and purify me from the multitude of my sins. Art thou not
overwhelmed with shame, O my soul, at the sight of the many offences which
thou hast committed against thy sovereign Lord? Is it thus that thou
servest a God of infinite majesty? Is this what thou hast promised Him so
often, and to which thou art engaged by the holiness of thy vocation?
Knowest thou not that the least sin is an offence to the infinite majesty
of God, that it contains an infinite malice, that it is an evil which
insults and offends thy most loving Father, thy most bountiful Saviour,
thy most sweet and merciful Lord? Ah, if thou didst but know what venial
sin really is; if thou didst but comprehend the stain which it produces
upon thee, the deformity, the wounds it occasions in the eyes of God; the
torment which it draws upon it in the other life, the danger to which it
exposes thy salvation, thou wouldst give a thousand lives, if thou hadst
them, rather than sully thy conscience with it. Thou feelest a difficulty
in conceiving a bitter sorrow for thy ordinary faults, because they are
venial; but this arises from thy want of light. The saints, to whom God
communicated in abundance His supernatural inspirations, wept day and
night bitterly over their faults, which were slighter than those thou dost
commit daily.

It is enough, O my God, that slight as these sins appear, they have
displeased and offended Thee, to induce me to conceive an extreme horror
for them, and to make me employ all my efforts to correct them. I love
Thee, O God of love; I praise and glorify Thee, O infinite majesty! O
purity of heart, which cannot endure any attachment or affection to the
slightest sin, how lovely art thou! How happy is he who is possessed of
thee, for thou renderest us favorites of God, thou makest our souls
temples of the Holy Ghost, and dost draw down upon us all the graces and
blessings of heaven! I will omit no pains that I may obtain thee in
future. But it is from Thee alone, O Lord, that I may hope for this
happiness: I am too weak to aspire after it by my own efforts. Thou alone
canst enrich me with a gift so precious; grant it to me, I pray Thee, O my
God. Amen.

Good Resolutions.

Since I have had the misfortune to offend Thee, O my God, and that I
cannot recall the past, I resolve at least, with the assistance of Thy
grace, to repair it by henceforth carefully avoiding all that displeases
Thee. I will shun sin, with its sources and occasions, particularly those
sins into which my natural frailty most frequently leads me. I will adopt
the means suggested by Thy minister for the correction of my faults,
listening to his words as if spoken by Thyself. I know, O my God, what I
should have to apprehend from the severity of Thy justice, if Thy anger
had not been appeased by the merits of Jesus Christ. I feel that Thou wilt
not reject the prayer of Thine innocent Son, Whose blood pleads for me,
His guilty creature. In this hope, O God of goodness! I present myself at
Thy tribunal, there to accuse myself of my sins, entirely, sincerely, and
humbly, with full confidence that Thou wilt ratify in heaven the
absolution pronounced on earth. Holy Virgin! Mother of grace and mercy!
Refuge of sinners! intercede for me, that in this confession I may receive
full pardon for the past, and grace to avoid sin in future. My good angel!
who hast been the witness of my transgressions, help me to rise from my
evil habits, and obtain for me strength against future relapses. Amen.

After Confession.

Prayer After Confession.

Can I persuade myself, O Lord! that, criminal as I was a few moments
since, I am now, by the grace of the sacrament, purified from my sins! God
of mercy! Who, by the absolution pronounced by Thy minister, hast cleansed
me from my iniquities, and restored me to Thy favor, shedding on me Thy
precious blood, and applying to my soul the virtue of Thy sacred wounds,
how shall I acknowledge the wonders of Thy love! Truly, O Lord, are Thy
mercies above all Thy works! How shall I prove my gratitude to Thee, O
divine Benefactor of my soul! I will offer Thee this day, and all the days
of my life, a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and incessantly extol Thy divine
munificence. I will consecrate my whole existence to Thee, shunning sin,
and loving Thee with my whole heart. Oh, permit not that I should again
trample on the blood which saved me, and grieve the Heart which was broken
for me. Give efficacy to my desire nevermore to offend Thee: fortify my
weakness; preserve me from occasions of sin; grant me the grace of steady
perseverance in my good resolutions. O Strength of the weak! in proportion
as I distrust myself, so do I firmly hope in Thee; grant me, then, Thy
all-powerful assistance, on which alone I rely. Prostrate at Thy feet, O
my Saviour! with the penitent Magdalen, I implore this, as the greatest of
all favors. O Father of mercies! I know that Thou art reluctant to destroy
the vessel of clay Thy hands have formed; strengthen me, then, against
future relapses. Holy Virgin, support me by thy powerful protection; all
ye angels and saints, intercede for my conversion and sanctification.

Offering of the Penance Enjoined at Confession.


    Before leaving the chapel offer your penance, or such portion as
    you can, prefacing it with the following or some appropriate
    prayer.


O God of sanctity! of myself I have no means of satisfying Thy rigorous
justice, but I offer Thee an abundant satisfaction in the infinite merits
of a God-man. I present Thee, O my God! the Sacred Heart of Thy Son,
filled with sadness and pierced with wounds for me, that Thy justice may
thus be appeased. I unite my sufferings to the bitter pangs of my dying
Saviour. May the abundance of His merits, and the immense charity of His
Heart, supply for the imperfection and insufficiency of my works. O Lord!
Who hast severed my chains, strengthen me with Thy grace, that I may never
resume them; that I may conquer the bad habits which have been so long
opposed to Thy spirit, and courageously resist the temptations to which I
have hitherto so easily yielded. Amen.

Aspirations, Some Of Which May Be Used Advantageously Before Or After
Confession.

My Lord and my God, I sincerely acknowledge myself a vile and wretched
sinner, unworthy to appear in Thy presence; but do Thou have mercy on me,
and save me.

Most loving Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before Thee, and am
unworthy to be called Thy child; make me as one of Thy servants, and may I
for the future be ever faithful to Thee.

It truly grieves me, O my God, to have sinned, and so many times
transgressed Thy law; but wash me now from my iniquity, and cleanse me
from my sin.

I detest my sins, O Lord: I abhor my wickedness: I confess my ingratitude,
and seek refuge in Thy mercy.

From this moment I purpose nevermore to offend Thee: oh, let me suffer all
kinds of pain and infamy, nay, even death itself, rather than return to my
former course of life, and live Thy enemy.

O loving Father, assist me by Thy grace, that I may bring forth worthy
fruits of penance, and not suffer my sins to go unpunished.

Now, O Lord, I begin to live, not trusting in my own strength, or in the
resolutions I make, but in the multitude of Thy mercies. Perfect, O God,
the work which Thou hast begun in me. Thou hast given me peace and
understanding; but, wretched sinner that I am, how ungratefully have I
abused all Thy gifts! And yet now, with all the tenderness of a loving
Father, Thou recallest me from sin, and rescuest me from hell and
everlasting damnation.

Alas! my soul is full of anguish and confusion at the recollection of the
many sins whereby I have offended Thee, my merciful Redeemer, made myself
a slave to the devil, and provoked Thy anger.

Oh, that I had never transgressed Thy commandments, nor fallen into such
an abyss of misery and calamity! Oh, that I had never sinned! Happy those
souls who have preserved their innocence: oh, that I had been so happy!

But now I am resolved, with the help of Thy grace, to be more watchful
over myself, to amend my failings, and fulfil Thy law. Look down on me
with the eyes of mercy, O God, and blot out my sins.

Forgive me what is past, and, through Thine infinite goodness, secure me,
by Thy grace, against all my wonted failings for the time to come.

My sins surpass in number the sands of the sea, and I confess myself, O
Lord, unworthy of Thy mercy; but Thy goodness is above all my offences.

Thou hast declared, O Lord, that there is joy in heaven for the conversion
of a sinner; grant me, then, the grace of true repentance, and let heaven
rejoice at my amendment.

Thou willest not the death of a sinner, but that he be converted and live.
Grant me, then, that spiritual life which I need; for behold, O Lord, I
sincerely desire to live to Thee.

Thou didst come, O dear Redeemer, not to call the just, but sinners, to
repentance; behold a miserable sinner here before Thee: oh, draw me
powerfully to Thyself.

Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and, according to
the multitude of Thy tender mercies, blot out my iniquities. Sprinkle me
with Thy precious blood, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Let not Thy precious blood, my dear Saviour, be shed for me in vain; but
may it now bring forth in me the fruit of sincere repentance, and open to
me the way to life everlasting.

How great is Thy goodness, O Lord, in having so long spared such a
worthless servant, and waited with so much patience for his amendment!
What return shall I make for Thy infinite mercies? Oh, let this mercy be
added to the rest, that I may nevermore offend Thee: this single favor I
earnestly beg of Thee, O Lord, viz., that I may for the future _renounce
my own way to follow Thine_.

Help me, O Lord my God, and have compassion on my sinful soul. Amen.




Communion.


Before Communion.

A Prayer Which May Be Said Some Days Before Communion.

O Lord Jesus Christ! Whom I aspire to receive in a few days within the
temple of my soul, I come to implore that Thou wilt Thyself prepare Thy
destined abode, cleansing it from every stain, and enriching it with
ornaments worthy of Thy presence. Grant me an increase of faith, hope, and
charity; grant me true contrition, and profound humility; grant me to sigh
with holy Simeon for Thy coming, and, like him, to centre in Thee alone
the ardent affections and fervent desires of my heart. O Lord! Whose
throne is surrounded by cherubim and seraphim! Whose presence is felt by
all creation, Whose spotless sanctity the angels themselves contemplate
with awe, I acknowledge my extreme unworthiness to receive Thee; but
animated with lively confidence in Thy paternal goodness, I conjure Thee
to prepare me Thyself, and to supply from the treasury of Thy abundant
mercies for all my deficiencies. O Thou Who hast come on earth to save me,
and Who by Thy sufferings hast opened heaven to receive me, grant me grace
to profit by all Thou hast done and endured for my salvation!

Aspirations Which Should Be Used The Days Preceding Communion.

As the wearied hart pines for the refreshing water, so does my soul thirst
for Thee, O Lord!

My soul sighs for the possession of God; when shall I come and appear
before Him? Lord, I come to Thee; but how shall I prepare the way for
Thee? I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; say but the
word, and my soul shall be healed.

How can I receive Thee into a heart so full of iniquities, and yet how can
I abstain from the living Bread come down from heaven to give life to the
world?

Have pity, I beseech Thee, on me, a sinner; and deign to prepare Thyself a
dwelling in my heart; grant that from Thy adorable body may proceed a
virtue to give strength and life to my soul.

Prepare me for Thyself, O Jesus! and render me worthy of Thy visit; look
on me, O Lord! and inflame me with Thy love; that I may run after the odor
of Thy perfumes.

Grant me humility of spirit, and pure charity, to render me worthy of
participating in the blessed food of heaven.

I wish to attract Thee by my love, and to enjoy Thy presence in the centre
of my soul. O my God! my life! my all! I beseech Thee to come into my
heart, and to unite me to Thyself forever.

Act Of Faith.

"Behold, He cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the
hills."--Cant. ii. 8. Ah, my most amiable Saviour, over how many, what
rough and craggy mountains, hast Thou had to pass in order to come and
unite Thyself to me by the means of this Most Holy Sacrament! Thou, from
being God, hadst to become man; from being immense, to become a babe; from
being Lord, to become a servant. Thou hadst to pass from the bosom of Thy
eternal Father to the womb of a Virgin; from heaven into a stable; from
the throne of glory to the gibbet of a criminal. And on this very morning
Thou wilt come from Thy seat in heaven to dwell in my bosom.

"Behold He standeth behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking
through the lattices," Cant. ii. 9. Behold, O my soul, thy loving Jesus,
burning with the same love with which He loved thee when dying for thee on
the cross, is now concealed in the Most Blessed Sacrament under the sacred
species: and what doing? "Looking through the lattices." As an ardent
lover, desirous to see his love corresponded with, from the Host, as from
within closed lattices, whence He sees without being seen, He is looking
at you, who are this morning about to feed upon His divine flesh. He
observes your thoughts, what it is that you love, what you desire, what
you seek for, and what offerings you are about to make Him.

Awake, then, my soul, and prepare to meet thy Jesus; and, in the first
place, by faith say to Him: So, then, my beloved Redeemer, in a few
moments Thou art coming to me? O hidden God, unknown to the greater part
of men, I believe, I confess, I adore Thee in the Most Holy Sacrament as
my Lord and Saviour! And in acknowledgment of this truth I would willingly
lay down my life. Thou comest to enrich me with Thy graces, and to unite
Thyself all to me; how great, then, should be my confidence in this Thy so
loving visit!

Act Of Confidence.

My soul, expand thy heart. Thy Jesus can do thee every good, and, indeed,
loves thee. Hope thou for great things from this thy Lord, Who, urged by
love, comes all love to thee. Yes, my dear Jesus, my hope, I trust in Thy
goodness, that, in giving Thyself to me this morning, Thou wilt enkindle
in my poor heart the beautiful flame of Thy pure love, and a real desire
to please Thee; so that, from this day forward, I may never will anything
but what Thou willest.

Act Of Love.

Ah, my God, my God, true and only love of my soul, and what more couldst
Thou have done to be loved by me? To die for me was not enough for Thee,
my Lord; Thou wast pleased to institute this great Sacrament in order to
give Thyself all to me, and thus bind and unite Thyself heart to heart
with so loathsome and ungrateful a creature as I am. And what is more,
Thou Thyself invitest me to receive Thee, and desirest so much that I
should do so! O boundless love! incomprehensible love! infinite love! a
God would give Himself all to me!

My soul, believest thou this? And what doest thou? what sayest thou? O
God, O God, O infinite amiability, only worthy object of all loves, I love
Thee with my whole heart, I love Thee above all things, I love Thee more
than myself, more than my life! Oh, could I but see Thee loved by all! Oh,
could I but cause Thee to be loved by all hearts as much as Thou
deservest! I love Thee, O most amiable God, and I unite my miserable heart
in loving Thee, to the hearts of the seraphim, to the heart of the most
blessed Virgin Mary, to the Heart of Jesus, Thy most loving and beloved
Son. So that, O infinite good, I love Thee with the love with which the
saints, with which Mary, with which Jesus love Thee. And I love Thee only
because Thou art worthy of it, and to give Thee pleasure. Depart, all
earthly affections, which are not for God, depart, from my heart. Mother
of fair love, most holy Virgin Mary, help me to love that God Whom thou
dost so ardently desire to see loved!

Act Of Humility.

Then, my soul, thou art even now about to feed on the most sacred flesh of
Jesus! And art thou worthy? My God, and who am I, and Who art Thou? I
indeed know and confess Whom Thou art Who givest Thyself to me; but dost
Thou know what I am who am about to receive Thee?

And is it possible, O my Jesus, that Thou Who art infinite purity desirest
to come and reside in this soul of mine, which has been so many times the
dwelling of Thy enemy, and soiled with so many sins? I know, O my Lord,
Thy great majesty and my misery; I am ashamed to appear before Thee.
Reverence would induce me to keep at a distance from Thee; but if I depart
from Thee, O my life, whither shall I go? to whom shall I have recourse?
and what will become of me? No, never will I depart from Thee; nay, even I
will ever draw nearer and nearer to Thee. Thou art satisfied that I should
receive Thee as food, Thou even invitest me to this. I come then, O my
amiable Saviour, I come to receive Thee this morning, all humbled and
confused at the sight of my defects; but full of confidence in Thy tender
mercy, and in the love which Thou bearest me.

Act Of Contrition.

I am indeed grieved, O God of my soul, for not having loved Thee during
the time past; still worse, so far from loving Thee, and to gratify my own
inclinations, I have greatly offended and outraged Thy infinite goodness:
I have turned my back against Thee, I have despised Thy grace and
friendship; in fine, O my God, I was deliberately in the will to lose
Thee. Lord, I am sorry, and grieve for it with my whole heart. I detest
the sins which I have committed, be they great or small, as the greatest
of all my misfortunes, because I have thereby offended Thee, O infinite
goodness. I trust that Thou hast already forgiven me; but if Thou has not
yet pardoned me, oh, do so before I receive Thee: wash with Thy blood this
soul of mine, in which Thou art so soon about to dwell.

Act Of Desire.

And now, my soul, the blessed hour is arrived in which Jesus will come and
take up His dwelling in thy poor heart. Behold the King of heaven, behold
thy Redeemer and God, Who is even now coming; prepare thyself to receive
Him with love, invite Him with the ardor of thy desire; come, O my Jesus,
come to my soul, which desires Thee. Before Thou givest Thyself to me, I
desire to give Thee, and I now give Thee, my miserable heart; do Thou
accept it, and come quickly to take possession of it.

Come, my God! hasten; delay no longer. My only and infinite good, my
treasure, my life, my paradise, my love, my all, my wish is to receive
Thee with the love with which the most holy and loving souls have received
Thee; with that with which the most blessed Virgin Mary received Thee;
with their communions I unite this one of mine.

Most holy Virgin and my Mother Mary, behold, I already approach to receive
thy Son. Would that I had the heart and love with which thou didst
communicate! Give me this morning thy Jesus, as thou didst give Him to the
shepherds and to the kings. I intend to receive Him from thy most pure
hands. Tell Him that I am thy servant and thy client; for He will thus
look upon me with a more loving eye, and now that He is coming, will press
me more closely to Himself.

After Communion.

Act Of Welcome.

Ah, my Jesus, my love, my infinite good, my all, be ever welcome in the
poor dwelling of my soul! Ah, my Lord, where art Thou! to what a place art
Thou come! Thou hast entered my heart, which is far worse than the stable
in which Thou wast born; it is full of earthly affections, of self-love,
and of inordinate desires. And how couldst Thou come to dwell there? I
would address Thee with St. Peter: "Depart from me, for I am a sinful
man."--St. Luke v. 8. Yes, depart from me, O Lord, for I am indeed unworthy
to receive a God of infinite goodness; go and find repose in those pure
souls who serve Thee with so much love. But no, my Redeemer; what do I
say? Leave me not; for if Thou departest, I am lost. I embrace Thee, my
life; I cling to Thee. Mad indeed have I been in having separated myself
from Thee for the love of creatures; and in my ingratitude I drove Thee
from me. But now I will never more separate myself from Thee, my treasure;
I desire to live and die united to Thee. Most blessed Virgin Mary,
seraphim, and all souls, do you who love God with pure love lend me your
affections, that I may worthily attend on my beloved Lord.

Loving Aspirations To Jesus In The Blessed Sacrament.


    They can be used either before or after communion, or in visiting
    the Blessed Sacrament.


1. "Go forth, ye daughters of Sion, and see King Solomon in the diadem
wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals."--Cant. iii.
11. O daughters of grace, O ye souls who love God, quit the darkness of
earth, and behold Jesus, your King, crowned with a crown of thorns; the
crown of contempt and suffering with which the impious synagogue, His
mother, crowned Him on the day of His espousals,--that is to say, on the
day of His death, by the means of which He espoused Himself on the cross
to our souls. Go forth again, my soul, and behold Him all full of
compassion and love, now that He comes to unite Himself to Thee in this
Sacrament of love.

Has it indeed, then, cost Thee so much, my beloved Jesus, before Thou
couldst come and unite Thyself to souls in this Most Sweet Sacrament? Wast
Thou indeed obliged to suffer so bitter and ignominious a death? Oh, come,
then, without delay and unite Thyself to my soul also. It was at one time
Thy enemy by sin; but now Thou desirest to espouse it by Thy grace. Come,
O Jesus, my Spouse, for nevermore will I betray Thee; I am determined to
be ever faithful to Thee. As a loving spouse, my whole thought shall be to
find out Thy pleasure. I am determined to love Thee without reserve; I
desire to be all Thine, my Jesus--all, all, all.

2. "A bundle of myrrh is my Beloved to me; He shall abide between my
breasts."--Cant. i. 12. The myrrh plant when pricked sends forth tears, and
a healthful liquor from the wounds. Before His Passion, our Jesus
determined to pour forth His divine blood from His wounds in so painful a
way, to give it afterwards all to us for our salvation in this bread of
life. Come, then, O my beloved bundle of myrrh, O my enamored Jesus; Thou
art indeed a subject of grief and pity to me, when I consider Thee all
wounded for me on the cross; but then, when I receive Thee in this Most
Sweet Sacrament, Thou becomest, indeed, to me more sweet and delicious
than a bunch of the choicest grapes can be to one who is parched with
thirst: "A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of
Engaddi."--Cant. i. 13. Come, then, to my soul, and revive and satiate me
with Thy holy love. Ah, what sweetness do I feel in my soul at the
thought, that I have to receive within myself that same Saviour of mine
Who for my salvation was pleased to be drained of all His blood, and
sacrificed on a cross! "He shall abide between my breasts." No, my Jesus,
nevermore will I drive Thee hence; and Thou shalt nevermore have to leave
me. I am determined ever to love Thee, and to be always united to and
closely bound up with Thee. I will always belong to Jesus, and Jesus will
be always mine; forever, forever, forever "He shall abide between my
breasts."

Act Of Thanksgiving.

My God and Lord, I thank Thee for the grace which Thou hast this morning
bestowed upon me, of coming to dwell in my soul; but I would wish to thank
Thee in a manner worthy of Thee and of the great favor which Thou hast
done me. But what do I say? how can such a miserable creature as I am ever
worthily thank Thee?

Father Segneri says that the feeling most becoming a soul who communicates
is that of wondering astonishment at the thought, and to repeat, "A God is
united to me; a God is mine!" David said, "What shall I render to the Lord
for all the things that He hath rendered to me?"--Ps. cxv. 12. But I! what
return shall I make to Thee, my Jesus, Who, after having given me so many
of Thy good things, hast this morning, moreover, given me Thyself? My
soul, bless, then, and thank thy God as best thou canst. And thou, my
Mother Mary, my holy advocates, my guardian angel, and all ye souls who
love God, "Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what
great things He hath done for my soul."--Ps. lxv. 16. Come and bless and
thank my God for me, admiring and praising the truly great graces which He
has granted me.

Act Of Oblation.

"My Beloved to me, and I to Him."--Cant. ii. 16. Should a king go to visit
a poor shepherd in his hut, what can the shepherd offer him other than his
whole hut, such as it is? Since, then, O Jesus, my divine King, Thou hast
come to visit the poor house of my soul, I offer and give Thee this house
and my entire self, together with my liberty and will: "My Beloved to me,
and I to Him." Thou hast given Thyself all to me; I give myself all to
Thee. My Jesus, from this day forward I will be no longer mine; I will be
Thine, and all Thine. May my senses be Thine, that they may only serve me
to please Thee. And what greater pleasure, says St. Peter of Alcantara,
can be found than that of pleasing Thee, most amiable, most loving, most
gracious God? I at the same time give Thee all the powers of my soul, and
I will that they shall be all Thine; my memory I will only use to recall
to mind Thy benefits and Thy love; my understanding I will only use to
think of Thee, Who always thinkest of my good; my will I will only use to
love Thee, my God, my all, and to will only that which Thou willest. My
most sweet Lord, I offer, then, and consecrate to Thee this morning all
that I am and have,--my senses, my thoughts, my affections, my desires, my
pleasures, my inclinations, my liberty, in a word, I place my whole body
and soul in Thy hands.

Accept, O infinite majesty, the sacrifice of the hitherto most ungrateful
sinner Thou hast ever had on earth; but who now offers and gives himself
all to Thee. Do with me and dispose of me, O Lord, as Thou pleasest.

Come, O consuming fire, O divine love! and consume in me all which is
mine, and which is displeasing in Thy most pure eyes, so that from
henceforward I may be all Thine, and may live only to execute, not Thy
commands and counsels alone, but all Thy holy desires and good pleasure
also. Amen.

O most holy Mary, do thou present this offering of mine to the most
Blessed Trinity with thine own hands; and do thou obtain their acceptance
of it, and that they may grant me the grace to be faithful unto death.
Amen, amen, amen.

Act Of Petition.

O my soul, what art thou doing? The present is no time to be lost: it is a
precious time, in which thou canst receive all the graces which thou
askest. Seest thou not the eternal Father, Who is lovingly beholding thee?
for within thee He sees His beloved Son, the dearest object of His love.
Drive, then, far from thee all other thoughts; rekindle thy faith, enlarge
thy heart, and ask for whatever thou willest.

Hearest thou not Jesus Himself Who thus addresses thee: "What wilt thou
that I should do to thee?"--St. Mark x. 51. O soul, tell me what dost thou
desire of Me? I am come for the express purpose of enriching and
gratifying thee; ask with confidence, and thou wilt receive all.

Ah! my most sweet Saviour, since Thou hast come into my heart in order to
grant me graces, and desirest that I should ask Thee for them, I ask Thee
not for the goods of the earth--riches, honors, or pleasures; but grant me,
I beseech Thee, intense sorrow for the displeasures I have caused Thee;
impart to me so clear a light, that I may know the vanity of this world,
and how deserving Thou art of love. Change this heart of mine, detach it
from all earthly affections; give me a heart conformable in all things to
Thy holy will, that it may seek only for that which is more pleasing to
Thee, and have no other desire than Thy holy love: "Create a clean heart
in me, O God."--Ps. l. 12.

I deserve not this; but Thou, my Jesus, deservest it, since Thou art come
to dwell in my soul: I ask it of Thee through Thy merits, and those of Thy
most holy Mother, and by the love which Thou bearest to Thy eternal
Father.


    Here pause, to ask Jesus for some other particular grace for
    yourself and for your neighbors. Do not forget poor sinners, or
    the souls in purgatory.


Eternal Father, Jesus Christ Himself, Thy Son, has said: "Amen, amen, I
say to you, if you ask the Father anything in My name, He will give it
you." For the love, then, of this Son, Whom I now hold within my breast,
do Thou graciously hear me and grant my petition.

My most sweet loves, Jesus and Mary, may I suffer for you, may I die for
you; may I be all yours, and in nothing my own! May the Most Blessed
Sacrament ever be thanked and praised! Blessed be the holy and immaculate
conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary!

                  -------------------------------------

1. O my God, when shall I burn with love for Thee?

2. Oh, how happy would be my lot!

3. But since I know not how to love Thee, I can rejoice at this, that so
many others love Thee with all their hearts.

4. I rejoice at this particularly, that the angels and saints love Thee in
heaven.

5. I unite my feeble heart to their inflamed hearts.

6. Would that I could love Thee as well as those saints who have been most
inflamed with love for Thee!

St. Catharine, and St. Teresa!

8. Or such as that of St. Augustine, St. Dominic, St. Francis Xavier, St.
Philip Neri, St. Aloysius Gonzaga.

9. Or as that which was entertained for Thee by the holy apostles; and
particularly by St. Peter, St. Paul, and the beloved disciple.

10. Or, in fine, as that with which the great patriarch St. Joseph loved
Thee.

Glory be to the Father.

                  -------------------------------------

1. Would, moreover, that I could love Thee as the Blessed Virgin loved
Thee upon earth!

2. As she loved Thee, particularly when she conceived Thy divine Son in
her virginal womb, when she brought Him into the world, when she nourished
Him with her milk, and when she saw Him die.

3. Would that I could love Thee as she loves Thee now, and as she will
love Thee forever in heaven!

4. But to love Thee as Thou deservest to be loved, O God, infinitely good,
even this would not suffice.

5. I should wish, moreover, to love Thee as the divine Word made man loved
Thee.

7. As He loved Thee expiring on the cross.

8. As He loves Thee continually in the tabernacles where He lies hid.

9. As He loves and shall love Thee forever.

10. In fine, my God, I wish to love Thee as Thou lovest us; but since that
is impossible, grant that I may love Thee as well as I know how, as much
as I can, and as much as Thou wishest me. Amen.

Glory be to the Father.


    Then say the following prayer:


O God, Who hast prepared invisible rewards for those who love Thee, pour
forth some of Thy love into our hearts, to the end that, loving Thee in
all and above all, we may obtain the accomplishment of Thy promises, which
surpass all desire; through Our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.


    You may also add the following:


Lift up thine eyes, O my soul; behold and see the power of thy King, the
grace of thy God, the love of thy Saviour, now that thou art so near to
Him. Take now thy rest, taste and see how fair and how comely is the
Spouse thou hast chosen. See what the delights are of that country towards
which thou art sighing. See how fair the splendor of that crown for which
thou toilest. See what is the essence and what the infinite grandeur of
thy God, Whom thou hast loved, Whom thou hast worshipped, for Whom thou
hast constantly longed.

O God of my life, what praises worthy of Thee can I offer Thee? Truly I
know not. What shall I render unto Thee, O my well-beloved, for all the
benefits wherewith Thou hast overwhelmed me? Thou in me, and I in Thee, O
Jesus, my one good; this is the thank-offering I set before Thy glory. I
have nothing else beside. My one only offering is what I am in Thee, my
life in Thee.

O God, Thou sacred object of my love, expand my heart in Thee, enlarge my
soul, and fill me with Thy glory. Oh, when shall it be said unto my soul:
"Turn again into thy rest, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee"?
When, oh, when shall I hear that blissful word: "Come, enter into the holy
place of the rest of thy Spouse"? O Jesus? my sweetest peace, when shall I
lay me down and take my rest in Thee, whilst Thou showest me all Thy
glory?


    Pius VII., by a rescript, Aug. 11, 1818, granted an indulgence of
    three hundred days to all the faithful who should recite, with a
    contrite heart, a succession of acts of the love of God, arranged

A WORD FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG


This file should be named 50739.txt or 50739.zip.

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Updated editions will replace the previous one -- the old editions will be
renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law
means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the
Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States
without permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works to protect
the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a
registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks,
unless you receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this ebook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use
this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works,
reports, performances and research. They may be modified and printed and
given away -- you may do practically _anything_ in the United States with
ebooks not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to
the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.



THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE


_Please read this before you distribute or use this work._

To protect the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or
any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project Gutenberg"),
you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.


General Terms of Use & Redistributing Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works


1.A.


By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work,
you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the
terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright)
agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this
agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works in your possession. If you paid a fee
for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work
and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may
obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set
forth in paragraph 1.E.8.


1.B.


"Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be used on or
associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be
bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that you can
do with most Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works even without complying
with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C below. There are
a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works if you
follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.


1.C.


The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation" or
PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an individual
work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works
based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are
removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works in compliance with the terms of this agreement
for keeping the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} name associated with the work. You can
easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License when you
share it without charge with others.


1.D.


The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you
can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant
state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of
your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before
downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating
derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work.
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of
any work in any country outside the United States.


1.E.


Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:


1.E.1.


The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access
to, the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License must appear prominently whenever
any copy of a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work (any work on which the phrase
"Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project Gutenberg"
is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or
distributed:


    This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States
    and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
    restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
    it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
    this ebook or online at http://www.gutenberg.org. If you are not
    located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws of the
    country where you are located before using this ebook.


1.E.2.


If an individual Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work is derived from texts
not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a notice indicating
that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can
be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying
any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a
work with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on
the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.


1.E.3.


If an individual Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work is posted with the
permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply
with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed
by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked to the Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License for all works posted with the permission of the
copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.


1.E.4.


Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License
terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or any
other work associated with Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}.


1.E.5.


Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this electronic
work, or any part of this electronic work, without prominently displaying
the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or immediate
access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License.


1.E.6.


You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed,
marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word
processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version posted
on the official Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} web site (http://www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other form.
Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License as
specified in paragraph 1.E.1.


1.E.7.


Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing,
copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works unless you comply
with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.


1.E.8.


You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or
distributing Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works provided that

    - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works calculated using the method you
      already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to
      the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark, but he has agreed to
      donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60
      days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally
      required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments
      should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,
      "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation."

    - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License.
      You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the
      works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and
      all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.

    - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
      any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
      receipt of the work.

    - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.


1.E.9.


If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic
work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this
agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The Project Gutenberg Trademark
LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark. Contact the Foundation
as set forth in Section 3 below.


1.F.


1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not
protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works,
and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such
as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data,
transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property
infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer
virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.


1.F.2.


LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES -- Except for the "Right of
Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for
damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE
NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH
OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE
FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGE.


1.F.3.


LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND -- If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.


1.F.4.


Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in
paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.


1.F.5.


Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the
exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.


1.F.6.


INDEMNITY -- You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark
owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and
any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution
of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs
and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from
any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of
this or any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, and (c) any Defect
you cause.


Section  2.


           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}'s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.

Section 4.


  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.


      General Information About Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep
ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each ebook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook's ebook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our ebooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new ebooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
