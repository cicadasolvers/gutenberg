                    SHAKESPEARE.


          Where is any author in the world
    Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?

      _Love's Labour's Lost, A. 4, S. 3._


        The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
    Into his study of imagination;
    And every lovely organ of her life
    Shall come apparel'd in more precious habit,
    More moving-delicate, and full of life,
    Into the eye and prospect of his soul.

      _Much Ado About Nothing, A. 4, S. 1._


        Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
    Shall win my love.

      _Taming of the Shrew, A. 4, S. 2._


        Win her with gifts, if she respect not words;
    Dumb jewels often, in their silent kind,
    More than quick words, do move a woman's mind.

      _Two Gentlemen of Verona, A. 3, S. 1._


        You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,
    Have too a woman's heart: which ever yet
    Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty.

      _Henry VIII., A. 2, S. 3._


        'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
    'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired.

      _Henry VI., Pt. 3, A. 1, S. 4._


        From woman's eyes this doctrine I derive;
    They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
    They are the books, the arts, the academes,
    That show, contain, and nourish all the world.

      _Love's Labour's Lost, A. 4, S. 3._


        Her voice was ever soft,
    Gentle, and low: an excellent thing in woman.

      _King Lear, A. 5, S. 3._


        Have you not heard it said full oft,
    A woman's nay doth stand for naught?

      _The Passionate Pilgrim, Line 14._


        Thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,
    And make it halt behind her.

      _The Tempest, A. 4. S. 1._


            Good name in man and woman,
    Is the immediate jewel of their souls.

      _Othello, A. 3, S. 3._


        Women are soft, pitiful, and flexible.

      _Henry VI., Pt. 3, A. 1. S. 4._


        Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
    Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
    And, when she's froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
    And not obedient to his honest will,
    What is she, but a contending rebel,
    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?

      _Taming of the Shrew, A. 5, S. 2._


        Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
    Her infinite variety: other women cloy
    The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
    Where most she satisfies.

      _Antony and Cleopatra, A. 2, S. 2._


        She's beautiful, and therefore to be wooed;
    She is a woman, therefore to be won.

      _Henry VI., Pt. 1, A. 5, S. 3._


        Say, that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain
    She sings as sweetly as a nightingale;
    Say, that she frown; I'll say, she looks as clear
    As morning roses newly wash'd with dew;
    Say, she be mute, and will not speak a word;
    Then I'll commend her volubility,
    And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.

      _Taming of the Shrew, A. 2, S. 1._


        Flatter, and praise, commend, extol their graces;
    ... Say they have angels' faces.
    That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
    If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.

      _Two Gentlemen of Verona, A. 3. S. 1._


        Bethink thee on her virtues that Surmount,
    And natural graces that extinguish art;
           *       *       *       *       *
    And, which is more, she is not so divine,
    So full-replete with choice of all delights,
    But, with as humble lowliness of mind,
    She is content to be at your command.

      _Henry VI., Pt. 1, A. 5, S. 5._


              Let still the woman take
    An elder than herself; so wears she to him,
    So sways she level in her husband's heart.
    For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
    Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
    More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn.
    Than women's are.

      _Twelfth Night, A. 2, S. 4.


            'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
    Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on.

      _Twelfth Night, A. 1, S. 5._


                     Fresh tears
    Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
    Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.

      _Titus Andronicus, A. 3, S. 1._


            Patience and sorrow strove
    Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
    Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears
    Were like a better day: those happy smilets,
    That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
    What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
    As pearls from diamonds dropp'd.

      _King Lear, A. 4, S. 2._


                   She is mine own;
    And I as rich in having such a jewel
    As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
    The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.

      _Two Gentlemen of Verona, A. 2, S. 4._


          A woman impudent and mannish grown
    Is not more loath'd than an effeminate man
    In time of action.

      _Troilus and Cressida, A. 3, S. 3._


            A woman's face, with Nature's own hand painted,
    Hast thou ...
    A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
    With shifting change, as is false woman's fashion:
    An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling
    Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth.

      _Sonnet XX._


          No other but a woman's reason;
    I think him so, because I think him so.

      _Two Gentlemen of Verona, A. 1, S. 2._


      The hand that hath made you fair hath made
    you good: the goodness that is cheap in beauty
    makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace
    being the soul of your complexion, should keep
    the body of it ever fair.

      _Measure for Measure, A. 3, S. 1._


                If ladies be but young and fair,
    They have the gift to know it.

      _As You Like It, A. 2, S. 7._


          If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
    But rather to beget more love in you:
    If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
           *       *       *       *       *
    Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
    For "_Get you gone_," she doth not mean "_Away!_"

      _Two Gentlemen of Verona, A. 3, S. 1._


              She never told her love,
    But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
    Feed on her damask cheek: she pin'd in thought,
    And, with a green and yellow melancholy,
    She saw, like Patience on a monument,
    Smiling at grief.

      _Twelfth Night, A. 2, S. 4._


                   She shall be
    A pattern to all ... living with her....
    Holy and heavenly thoughts shall still counsel her;
    She shall be lov'd and fear'd. Her own shall bless her....
    ... Those about her
    From her shall read the perfect ways of honour....
    ... Yet a virgin,
    A most unspotted lily shall she pass
    To the ground, and all shall mourn her.

      _Henry VIII., A. 5, S. 4._




                    JOHN MILTON.


    Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,
    In every gesture dignity and love.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


              When I approach
    Her loveliness, so absolute she seems
    And in herself complete, so well to know
    Her own, that what she wills to do or say
    Seems wisest, virtuest, discreetest, best.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


                Nothing lovelier can be found
    In woman than to study household good,
    And good works in her husband to promote.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 9._


    For contemplation he and valour form'd;
    For softness she and sweet attractive grace;
    He for God only, she for God in him.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 4._


              Among daughters of men ...
    Many are in each region passing fair
    As the noon sky; more like to goddesses
    Than mortal creatures; graceful and discreet;
    ... Persuasive ...
    Such objects have the power to soften and tame
    Severest temper.

      _Paradise Regained, Book 2._


                Ladies, whose bright eyes
    Rain influence.

      _L'Allegro._


    Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined.

      _Sonnet._


    O fairest of Creation, last and best
    Of all God's works, creature in whom excell'd
    Whatever can to sight or thought be form'd,
    Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!

      _Paradise Lost, Book 9._


    Curiosity, inquisitive, importune
    Of secrets, then with like infirmity
    To publish them, both common female faults.

      _Samson Agonistes._


    In argument with men, a woman ever
    Goes by the worse, whatever be her cause.

      _Samson Agonistes._


              Thus it will befall
    Him who to worth in woman overturning
    Lets her will rule; restraint she will not brook,
    And left to herself, if evil thence ensue,
    She first his weak indulgence will accuse.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 9._


            Daughter of God ...
    I, from the influence of thy looks, receive
    Access in every virtue: and in thy sight
    More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were
    Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on.
    Shame to be overcome or overreach'd.
    Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.
    Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
    When I am present, and thy trial choose
    With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?

      _Paradise Lost, Book 9._


            By his countenance he seem'd
    Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve
    Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,
    With lowliness majestic from her seat,
    And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
    Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,
    To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom,
    Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,
    And, touch'd by her fair tendance gladlier grew.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


    So dear to Heaven is saintly chastity,
    That, when a soul is found sincerely so
    A thousand liveried angels lackey her,
    Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,
    And in clear dream and solemn vision
    Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear;
    Till oft converse with heavenly habitants
    Begin to cast a beam on the outward shape.

      _Comus._


                      A smile that glow'd
    Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


            She has a hidden strength ...
    ... The strength of Heaven,
    It may be termed her own.
    'Tis chastity ... chastity....
    She that has that, is clad in complete steel;
    And, like a quiver'd Nymph with arrows keen,
    May trace huge forests, and unharbour'd heaths,
    ... and sandy perilous wilds ...
    She may pass on with unblench'd majesty
    Be it not done in pride, or in presumption.

      _Comus._


    O Woman, in thy native innocence, rely
    On what thou hast of virtue: summon all,
    For God toward thee hath done His part, do thine.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 9._


    What higher in her society thou find'st
    Attractive, human, rational, love still;
    In loving thou dost well, in passion not
    Wherein true love consists not.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


    The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
    Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,
    Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 9._


    Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat
    Build in her loveliest, and create an awe
    About her, as a guard angelic placed.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


                Those graceful acts,
    Those thousand decencies that daily flow
    From all her words and actions mix'd with love
    And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd
    Union of mind, or in us both one soul;
    Harmony to behold in wedded pair
    More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


    Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure,
    Sober, steadfast, and demure.
           *       *       *       *       *
    With even step and musing gait;
    And looks commercing with the skies,
    Thy wrapt soul sitting in thine eyes.

      _Il Penseroso._


            Innocence and virgin modesty
    Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,
    That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won
    Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retired
    The more desirable.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


      Lady, thy care is fix'd, and zealously attends
    To fill thy odorous lamp with deeds of light.
    And hope that reaps not shame.

      _Sonnet._


                    A creature ...
    ... So lovely fair,
    That what seem'd fair in all the world seem'd now
    Mean, or in her summ'd up, in her contain'd.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


    All things from her air inspired
    The spirit of love and amorous delight.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 8._


    It is for homely features to keep home--
    They had their name thence: coarse complexions
    And cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply
    The sampler and to tease the housewife's wool.

      _Comus._


    With dispatchful looks in haste
    She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent.
    What choice to choose for delicacy best,
    What order, so contrived, as not to mix
    Tastes, not well join'd, inelegant, but bring
    Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change.

      _Paradise Lost, Book 5._


          I do not think my sister ...
    ... So unprincipled in Virtue's book
    And the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever,
    As that single want of light and noise
    Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,
    And put them into misbecoming plight.
    Virtue could see to do what Virtue would
    By her own radiant light, though sun and moon
    Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self
    Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude:
    Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,
    She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings.
    That in the various bustle of resort
    Were all too ruffled, and sometimes impair'd.

      _Comus._




                    LORD BYRON.


          Around her shone
    The nameless charms unmark'd by her alone:
    The light of love, the purity of grace,
    The mind, the music breathing from her face,
    The heart whose softness harmonized the whole--
    And, oh! that eye was in itself a soul!

      _The Bride of Abydos, Canto 1._


    Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,
    And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.

      _Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto 1._


          She was a form of life and light,
    That, seen, became a part of sight;
    And rose wher'er I turned mine eye,
    The morning-star of memory!

      _The Giaour._


        You know, or ought to know, enough of women,
    Since you have studied, them so steadily,
    That what they ask in aught that touches on
    The heart, is dearer to their feelings or
    Their fancy than the whole external world.

      _Sardanapalus, A. 4._


          Oh! too convincing--dangerously dear--
    In woman's eye the unanswerable tear!
    That weapon of her weakness she can wield
    To save, subdue--at once her spear and shield.

      _Corsair, Canto 2._


    Who hath not proved how feebly words essay
    To fix one spark of beauty's heavenly ray?
    Who doth not feel, until his failing sight
    Faints into dimness with its own delight,
    His changing cheek, his sinking heart confess
    The might--the majesty of loveliness?

      _Bride of Abydos, Canto 1._


    So bright the tear in beauty's eye,
    Love half regrets to kiss it dry;
    So sweet the blush of bashfulness,
    Even pity scarce can wish it less!

      _The Bride of Abydos, Canto 1._


    Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
    Bright with intelligence, and fair and smooth;
    Her eyebrow's shape was like the aerial bow
    Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth
    Mounting, at times to a transparent glow,
    As if her veins ran lightning.

      _Don Juan, Canto 1._


    Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
      Is woman's whole existence.

      _Don Juan, Canto 1._


    Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;
      Her very nod was not an inclination;
    There was a self-will even in her small feet,
      As though they were quite conscious of her station;--
           *       *       *       *       *
    But nature teaches more than power can spoil,
      And when a strong although a strange sensation
    Moves--female hearts are such a genial soil
      For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation.
    They naturally pour the "wine and oil,"
      Samaritans in every situation.

      _Don Juan, Canto 5._


    The earth has nothing like a she epistle,
      And hardly heaven--because it never ends.
    I love the mystery of a female missal,
      Which like a creed ne'er says all it intends.

      _Don Juan, Canto 13._


    Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,
      Which judged mankind at their due estimation;
    And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:
      Secure of admiration, its impression
      Was faint, as of an every-day possession.

      _Don Juan, Canto 13._


    An eye's an eye, and whether black or blue,
      Is no great matter, so 'tis in request.
    'Tis nonsense to dispute about a hue,
      The kindest may be taken as a test.
    The fair sex should be always fair; and no man
    Till thirty, should perceive there's a plain woman.

      _Beppo._



    She was not violently lively, but
      Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;
    Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half shut,
      They put beholders in a tender taking.

      _Don Juan, Canto 6._


            The very first
    Of human life must spring from woman's breast,
    Your first small words are taught you from her lips,
    Your first tears quench'd by her, and your last sighs
    Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,
    When men have shrunk from the ignoble care
    Of watching the last hour of him who led them.

      _Sardanapalus, A. 1._


    Soft, as the memory of buried love;
    Pure, as the prayer which childhood wafts above
    Was she.

      _Bride of Abydos; Canto 1._


    She was a soft landscape of mild earth,
      Where all was harmony, and calm and quiet,
    Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,
      Which, if not happiness, is more nigh it
    Than are your mighty passions and so forth,
      Which some call "the sublime": I wish they'd try it;
    I've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,
    And pity lovers rather more than seamen.

      _Don Juan, Canto 6._


      The tender blue of that large loving eye.

      _The Corsair, Canto 1._


    Now Laura moves along the joyous crowd,
      Smiles in her eyes, and simpers on her lips;
    To some she whispers, others speaks aloud;
      To some she curtsies, and to some she dips;
    Complains of warmth, and this complaint avow'd,
      Her lover brings the lemonade,--she sips:
    She then surveys, condemns, but pities still
    Her dearest friends for being drest so ill.
    One had false curls, another too much paint,
      A third--where did she buy that frightful turban?
    A fourth's so pale she fears she's going to faint,
      A fifth's look's vulgar, dowdyish, and suburban,
    A sixth's white silk has got a yellow tint,
      A seventh's thin muslin surely will be her bane,
    And lo! an eighth appears,--I'll see no more!
    For fear, like Banquo's kings, they reach a score.

      _Beppo._


    She was blooming still, had made the best
      Of time, and time return'd the compliment,
    And treated her genteely, so that, drest,
      She look'd extremely well where'er she went;
    A pretty woman is a welcome guest,
      And her brow a frown had rarely bent;
    Indeed she shone all smiles, and seem'd to flatter
    Mankind with her black eyes for looking at her.

      _Beppo._


    I think, with all due deference
      To the fair _single_ part of the creation,
    That married ladies should preserve the preference
      In tete-a-tete or general conversation--
    Because they know the world, and are at ease,
    And being natural, naturally please.

      _Beppo._


    She walks in beauty, like the night
      Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
    And all that's best of dark and bright
      Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
    Thus mellow'd to that tender light
      Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

    One shade the more, one ray the less,
      Had half impair'd the nameless grace
    Which waves in every raven tress,
      Or softly lightens o'er her face;
    Where thoughts serenely sweet express
      How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

    And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
      So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
    The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
      But tell of days in goodness spent,
    A mind at peace with all below,
      A heart whose love is innocent!

      _Hebrew Melodies._


    I saw thee weep--the big bright tear
      Came o'er that eye of blue:
    And then methought it did appear
      A violet dropping dew;
    I saw thee smile--the sapphire's blaze
      Beside thee ceased to shine,
    It could not match the living rays
      That fill'd that glance of thine.

    As clouds from yonder sun receive
      A deep and mellow die,
    Which scarce the shade of coming eve
      Can banish from the sky,
    Those smiles unto the moodiest mind
      Their own pure joy impart;
    Their sunshine leaves a glow behind
      That lightens o'er the heart.

      _Hebrew Melodies._


    I have observed your sex, once roused to wrath,
    Are timidly vindictive to a pitch
    Of perseverance, which I would not copy.

      _Sardanapalus, A. 2._


    She was pensive more than melancholy,
    And serious more than pensive, and serene,
    It may be, more than either ...
    The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly
    Unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,
    That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;
    She never thought about herself at all.

      _Don Juan, Canto 6.
      _

    A learned lady, famed
      For every branch of every science known--
    In every Christian language ever named,
      With virtues equall'd by her wit alone.
    She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
      And even the good with inward envy groan,
    Finding themselves so very much exceeded
    In their own way by all the things that she did.

      _Don Juan, Canto 1._


    'Tis pity learned virgins ever wed
      With persons of no sort of education,
    Or gentlemen who, though well-born and bred,
      Grow tired of scientific conversation:
           *       *       *       *       *
    Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
    Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?

      _Don Juan, Canto 1._


    What a strange thing is man! and what a stranger
    Is woman? what a whirlwind is her head,
    And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
    Is all the rest about her! whether wed,
    Or widow, maid, or mother, she can change her
    Mind like the wind; whatever she has said
    Or done, is light to what she'll say or do;--
    The oldest thing on record, and yet new!

      _Don Juan, Canto 9._


    Round her she made an atmosphere of life,
      The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,
    They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
      With all we can imagine of the skies;--
           *       *       *       *       *
    Her overpowering presence made you feel,
    It would not be idolatry to kneel.

      _Don Juan, Canto 3._


    Through her eye the Immortal shone;
           *       *       *       *       *
    Her eyes' dark charm 'twere vain to tell,
    But gaze on that of the gazelle,
    It will assist thy fancy well;
    As large, as languishingly dark,
    But soul beamed forth in every spark
    That darted from beneath the lid,
    Bright as the jewel of Giamschid,
    Yea, soul!

      _The Giaour._


          So--this feminine farewell
    Ends as such partings end, in _no_ departure.

      _Sardanapalus, A. 4._




                    SIR WALTER SCOTT.


     Even the most simple and unsuspicious of the female sex have (God
     bless them!) an instinctive sharpness of perception in love
     matters, which sometimes goes the length of observing partialities
     that never existed, but rarely misses to detect such as pass
     actually under their observation.--_Waverley._


          Her accents stole
    On the dark visions of their soul,
    And bade their mournful musings fly,
    Like mist before the zephyr's sigh.

      _Rokeby, Canto 4._


     She sung with great taste and feeling, and with a respect to the
     sense of what she uttered, that might be proposed in example to
     ladies of much superior musical talent. Her natural good sense
     taught her, that if, as we are assured, "music must be married to
     immortal verse," they are very often divorced by the performer in a
     most shameful manner. It was perhaps owing to this sensibility to
     poetry, and combining its expression with those of the musical
     notes, that her singing gave more pleasure to all the unlearned in
     music, and even to many of the learned, than could have been
     communicated by a much finer voice and more brilliant execution,
     unguided by the same delicacy of feeling.--_Waverley._


     Like every beautiful woman, she was conscious of her own power, and
     pleased with its effects.... But as she possessed excellent sense,
     she gave accidental circumstances, full weight in appreciating the
     feeling she aroused.--_Waverley._


    There was a soft and pensive grace,
    A cast of thought upon her face,
    That suited well the forehead high,
    The eye-lash dark, and downcast eye;
    The mild expression spoke a mind
    In duty firm, composed, resign'd.

      _Rokeby, Canto 4._


    The rose, with faint and feeble streak
    So slightly tinged the maiden's cheek,
    That you had said her hue was pale;
    But if she faced the summer-gale,
    Or spoke, or sung, or quicker moved,
    Or heard the praise of those she loved,
    Or when of interest was express'd
    Aught that waked feeling in her breast,
    That mantling blood in ready play
    Rivall'd the blush of rising day.

      _Rokeby, Canto 4._


     What woman knows not her own road to victory?--_The Talisman._


     She had been beautiful, and was stately and majestic in her
     appearance. Endowed by nature with strong powers and violent
     passions, experience had taught her to employ the one, and to
     conceal, if not to moderate, the other. She was a severe and strict
     observer of the external forms, at least, of devotion; her
     hospitality was splendid, even to ostentation; her address and
     manners were grave, dignified, and severely regulated by the rules
     of etiquette.... And yet, with all these qualities to excite
     respect, she was seldom mentioned in the terms of love or
     affection. Interest,--the interest of her family, if not her
     own--seemed too obviously the motive of her actions: and when this
     is the case, the sharp-judging and malignant public are not easily
     imposed upon by outward show.--_The Bride of Lammermoor._


     Reasoning--like a woman, to whom external appearance is scarcely in
     any circumstance a matter of unimportance, and like a beauty who
     has confidence in her own charms.--_Kenilworth._


     Her affection and sympathy dictated at once the kindest course.
     Without attempting to control the torrent of grief in its full
     current, she gently sat her down beside the mourner.... She waited
     a more composed moment to offer her little stock of consolation in
     deep silence and stillness.--_The Betrothed._


    Her kindness and her worth to spy
    You need but gaze on Ellen's eye;
    Not Katrine in her mirror blue,
    Gives back the shaggy banks more true,
    Than every free-born glance confess'd
    The guileless movements of her breast;
    Whether joy danced in her dark eye,
    Or woe or pity claim'd a sigh,
    Or filial love was glowing there,
    Or meek devotion pour'd a prayer.
    Or hate of injury call'd forth
    The indignant spirit of the North.
    One only passion unreveal'd,
    With maiden pride, the maid conceal'd,
    Yet no less purely felt the flame--
    O need I tell that passion's name?

      _The Lady of the Lake, Canto 1._


     She is fairer in feature than becometh a man of my order to speak
     of; and she has withal a breathing of her father's lofty spirit.
     The look and the word of such a lady will give a man double
     strength in the hour of need.--_The Betrothed._


    Her smile, her speech, with winning sway,
    Wiled the old harper's mood away.
    With such a look as hermits throw
    When angels stoop to soothe their woe,
    He gazed, till fond regret and pride
    Thrill'd to a tear.

      _The Lady of the Lake, Canto 2._


    All her soul is in her eye,
    Yet doubts she still to tender free
    The wonted words of courtesy.
           *       *       *       *       *
    Go to her now--be bold of cheer,
    While her soul floats 'twixt hope and fear:
    It is the very change of tide,
    When best the female heart is tried--
    Pride, prejudice ...
    Are in the current swept to sea.

      _Rokeby, Canto 2._


     She was highly accomplished; yet she had not learned to substitute
     the gloss of politeness for the reality of feeling.--_Waverley._


     A deep-thinking and impassioned woman, ready to make exertions
     alike, and sacrifices, with all that vain devotion to a favorite
     object of affection, which is often so basely rewarded.--_The
     Fortunes of Nigel._


       The spotless virgin fears not the raging lion.--_The Talisman._


    Sweet was her blue eye's modest smile ...
    And down her shoulders graceful roll'd
    Her locks profuse of paly gold ...
    She charm'd at once, and tamed the heart.

     _Marmion, Canto 5._


    At length, an effort sent apart
    The blood that curdled to her heart,
    And light came to her eye,
    And color dawn'd upon her cheek,
    A hectic and a flutter'd streak.
           *       *       *       *       *
    And when her silence broke at length,
    Still as she spoke she gather'd strength,
    And arm'd herself to bear;--
    It was a fearful sight to see
    Such high resolve and constancy,
    In form so soft and fair.

     _Marmion, Canto 2._


    She look'd down to blush, and she look'd up to sigh,
    With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.

     _Marmion, Canto 5._


     Her very soul is in home, and in the discharge of all those quiet
     virtues of which home is the centre. Her husband will be to her the
     object of all her care, solicitude, and affection. She will see
     nothing, but by him, and through him. If he is a man of sense and
     virtue, she will sympathize in his sorrows, divert his fatigue, and
     share his pleasures. If she becomes the property of a churlish or
     negligent husband, she will suit his taste also, for she will not
     long survive his unkindness.--_Waverley._


     When there can be no confidence betwixt a man and his plighted
     wife, it is a sign she has no longer the regard for him that made
     their engagement safe and suitable.--_The Heart of Mid-Lothian._


     She was by nature perfectly good-humoured, and if her due share of
     admiration and homage was duly resigned to her, no one could
     possess better temper, or a more friendly disposition; but then,
     like all despots, the more power that was voluntarily yielded to
     her, the more she desired to extend her sway. Sometimes, even when
     all her ambition was gratified, she chose to be a little out of
     health, and a little out of spirits.--- _The Talisman._


    Her look composed, and steady eye,
    Bespoke a matchless constancy.

      _Marmion, Canto 2._


    The noble dame, amid the broil,
    Shared the gray seneschal's high toil,
    And spoke of danger with a smile;
    Cheer'd the young knights, and council sage
    Held with the chiefs of riper age.

    Woman's faith and woman's trust,

      _The Betrothed._


    Ne'er did Grecian chisel trace
    A Nymph, or Naiad, or a Grace,
    Of finer form, or lovelier face!
    What though the sun, with ardent frown,
    Had slightly tinged her cheek with brown,
    The sportive toil, which, short and light
    Had dyed her glowing hue so bright,
    Served too in hastier swell to show
    Short glimpses of a breast of snow;
    What though no rule of courtly grace
    To measured mood had train'd her pace,--
    A foot more light, a step more true,
    Ne'er from the heath-flower dash'd the dew;
    E'en the slight hare-bell raised its head,
    Elastic from her airy tread;
    What though upon her speech there hung
    The accent of the mountain tongue,
    Those silver sounds, so soft, so clear,
    The list'ner held his breath to hear.

      _Lady of the Lake, Canto 1._


     Spoilt she was on all hands.... But though, from these
     circumstances, the city-beauty had become as wilful, as capricious,
     and as affected, as unlimited indulgence seldom fails to render
     those to whom it is extended; and although she exhibited upon many
     occasions that affectation of extreme shyness, silence, and
     reserve, which misses are apt to take for an amiable modesty; and
     upon others, a considerable portion of that flippancy which youth
     sometimes confounds with wit, she had much real shrewdness and
     judgment, which wanted only opportunities of observation to refine
     it--a lively, good-humoured, playful disposition, and an excellent
     heart.--_The Fortunes of Nigel._


     The buoyant vivacity with which she had resisted every touch of
     adversity, had now assumed the air of composed and submissive, but
     dauntless, resolution and constancy.--_Rob Roy._


     Her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her head
     and features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches to
     fair beauties. Her clear blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a
     graceful eyebrow of brown, sufficiently marked to give expression
     to the forehead, seemed capable to kindle as well as to melt, to
     command as well as to beseech.--_Ivanhoe._

    She was a Phantom of delight
    When first she gleamed upon my sight;
    A lovely Apparition, sent
    To be a moment's ornament;
    Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair;
    Like Twilight's, too, her dusky hair;
    But all things else about her drawn
    From May-time and the cheerful Dawn;
    A dancing Shape, and Image gay,
    To haunt, to startle, and waylay.

    A gentle maid, whose heart is lowly bred,

    A Spirit, yet a Woman too!
    Her household motions light and free,
    And steps of virgin liberty;
    A countenance in which did meet

    A Creature not too bright or good
    For human nature's daily food;
    For transient sorrows, simple wiles,
    Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.

    She gave me eyes, she gave me ears;

    A heart, the fountain of sweet tears;
    And love and thought and joy.

    The floating clouds their state shall lend
    To her; for her the willow bend;
    Nor shall she fail to see,
    Even in the motions of the storm,
    Grace that shall mould the Maiden's form
    By silent sympathy.
    The stars of midnight shall be dear
    To her; and she shall lean her ear
    In many a secret place,
    Where rivulets dance their wayward round,
    And beauty born of murmuring sound
    Shall pass into her face.
    And vital feelings of delight
    Shall rear her form to stately height,
    Her virgin bosom swell.

      _Three Years She Grew in Sun and Shower._


    How blest the Maid whose heart--yet free
    From Love's uneasy sovereignty--
    Beats with a fancy running high,
    Her simple cares to magnify;
    Whom Labour, never urged to toil,
    Hath cherished on a healthful soil;
    Who knows not pomp, who heeds not pelf;
    Whose heaviest sin it is to look
    Askance upon her pretty self
    Reflected in some crystal brook;
    Whom grief hath spared,--who sheds no tear
    But in sweet pity; and can hear
    Another's praise from envy clear.

    And yet a Spirit still, and bright
    With something of angelic light.

          This light-hearted Maiden....
    High is her aim as Heaven above,
    And wide as either her good-will;
    And, like the lowly reed, her love
    Can drink its nurture from the scantiest rill;
    Insight as keen as frosty star
    Is to her charity no bar,
    Nor interrupts her frolic graces.


      _The Triad._


        O Lady bright,

      _Sonnet._


    A maid whom there wore none to praise
    And very few to love;
    A violet by a mossy stone

    Fair as a star when only one
    Is shining in the sky.

    Whether in the semblance drest
    Of Dawn, or Eve, fair vision of the west,

    Softly she treads, as if her foot were loth
    To crush the mountain dew-drops,--soon to melt

    With all their fragrance, all their glistening,
    Call to the heart for inward listening.

      So, Mary, let it be
    If naught in loveliness compare
      With what thou art to me.

      Beholds her own bright beams
    Reflected from the mountain's side
      And from the headlong streams.

      _Grace Darling._


          In her face and mien
    The soul's pure brightness he beheld,
    Without a veil between.

      _The Russian Fugitive._


    We her discretion have observed,
    Her just opinions, delicate reserve,
    Her patience, and humility of mind.
    Unspoiled by commendation....

      _The Borderers._


    O Lady, worthy of earth's proudest throne!
    Nor less, by excellence of nature, fit
    Beside an unambitious hearth to sit
    Domestic queen, where grandeur is unknown;
    What living man could fear
    The worst of Fortune's malice, wert thou near,
    Humbling that lily-stem, thy sceptre meek,
    That its fair flowers may from his cheek
    Brush the too happy tear!

      _The Triad._


          Queen, and handmaid lowly!
    Whose skill can speed the day with lively cares,
          And banish melancholy
    By all that mind invents or hand prepares;
           *       *       *       *       *
    Who that hath seen thy beauty could content
    His soul with but a glimpse!

      _The Triad._


          Dear girl ...
    If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,
    Thy nature is not therefore less divine;
    Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year;
    And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner shrine,
    God being with thee when we know it not.

      _Sonnet._


         I knew a maid,
    A young enthusiast ...
    Her eye was not the mistress of her heart;
    Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste
    Or barren, intermeddling subtleties,
    Perplex her mind; but wise as women are
    When genial circumstance hath favoured them,
    She welcomed what was given, and craved no more,
    Whate'er the scene presented to her view.
    That was the best, to that she was attuned
    By her benign simplicity of life,
    ... God delights
    In such a being; for her common thoughts
    Are piety, her life is gratitude.

      _The Prelude._


    Sweet girl, a very shower
    Of beauty is thy earthly dower!...
    Never saw I mien, or face,
    In which more plainly I could trace
    Benignity and homebred sense
    Ripening in perfect innocence.
           *       *       *       *       *
    A face with gladness overspread!
    Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!
    And seemliness complete, that sways
    Thy courtesies, about three plays.

      _To A Highland Girl._


          A maiden ...
    Lovely as spring's first note ... Pure
      As beautiful, and gentle and benign.
           *       *       *       *       *
          A Flower....
    Fairest of all flowers was she....
      She hath an eye that smiles into all hearts,
           *       *       *       *       *
    Soon would her gentle words make peace.

      _The Borderers._


    Yes! thou art fair, yet be not moved
      To scorn the declaration,
    That sometimes I in thee have loved
      My fancy's own creation.

    Imagination needs must stir;
      Dear Maid, this truth believe,
    Minds that have nothing to confer,
      Find little to perceive.

    Be pleased that Nature made thee fit
      To feed my heart's devotion,
    By laws to which all forms submit
      In sky, air, earth, and ocean.

      _Poems of the Affections, 16._




                    THOMAS CARLYLE.


     Clearly a superior woman.--That is the way with female intellects
     when they are good; nothing equals their acuteness, and their
     rapidity is almost excessive.--_Frederick the Great._


     Perfection of housekeeping was her clear and speedy attainment in
     that new scene. Strange how she made the desert blossom for herself
     and me there; what a fairy palace she had made of that wild
     moorland home of the poor man! From the baking of a loaf, or the
     darning of a stocking, up to comporting herself in the highest
     scenes or most intricate emergencies, all was insight, veracity,
     graceful success (if you could judge it), fidelity to insight of
     the fact given.--_Reminiscences._


     Meek and retiring by the softness of her nature, yet glowing with
     an ethereal ardour for all that is illustrious and lovely.--_Life
     of Schiller._

     She was of a compassionate nature, and had a loving, patient, and
     noble heart; prudent she was; the skilfulest and thriftiest of
     financiers; could well keep silence, too, and with a gentle
     stoicism endure much small unreason.--_Life of Schiller._


     Her life was busy and earnest; she was help-mate, not in name only,
     to an ever-busy man.--_Frederick the Great._

     Peculiar among all dames and damosels, glanced Blumine, there in
     her modesty, like a star among earthly lights. Noblest maiden! whom
     he bent to, in body and in soul; yet scarcely dared look at, for
     the presence filled him with painful yet sweetest embarrassment.
     --_Sartor Resartus._


     A bright airy lady; very graceful, very witty and ingenious;
     skilled to speak, skilled to hold her tongue.--_Frederick the
     Great._


     Far and wide was the fair one heard of, for her gifts, her graces,
     her caprices; from all which vague colourings of Rumour, from the
     censures no less than from the praises, had our friend painted for
     himself a certain imperious Queen of Hearts, and blooming warm
     Earth-angel, much more enchanting than your mere white
     Heaven-angels of women, in whose placid veins circulates too little
     naphtha-fire.--_Sartor Resartus._


     A tall, rather thin figure; a face pale, intelligent, and
     penetrating; nose fine, rather large, and decisively Roman; pair of
     bright, not soft, but sharp and small black eyes, with a cold smile
     as of enquiry in them; fine brow; fine chin; thin lips--lips always
     gently shut, as if till the enquiry were completed, and the time
     came for something of royal speech upon it. She had a slight
     accent, but spoke--Dr. Hugh Blair could not have picked a hole in
     it--and you might have printed every word, so queen-like, gentle,
     soothing, measured, prettily royal toward subjects whom she wished
     to love her. The voice was modulated, low, not inharmonious; yet
     there was something of metallic in it, akin to that smile in the
     eyes. One durst not quite love this high personage as she wished to
     be loved! Her very dress was notable; always the same, and in a
     fashion of its own;--and must have required daily the fastening of
     sixty or eighty pins.--_Reminiscences._


     She had a pleasant, attractive physiognomy; which may be considered
     better than strict beauty.--_Frederick the Great._


     That light, yet so stately form; those dark tresses, shading a face
     where smiles and sun-light played over earnest deeps.... He
     ventured to address her, she answered with attention: nay, what if
     there were a slight tremour in that silver voice; what if the red
     glow of evening were hiding a transient blush!--_Sartor Resartus._


     The whims of women must be humoured.--_French Revolution._


     A woman of many household virtues; to a warm affection for her
     children and husband she joined a degree of taste and intelligence
     which is of much rarer occurrence.--_Life of Schiller._


    She is meek and soft and maiden-like....
    A young woman fair to look upon.

      _Life of Schiller._


     My dear mother, with the trustfulness of a mother's heart,
     ministered to all my woes, outward and inward, and even against
     hope kept prophesying good.--_Reminiscences._


     Women are born worshippers; in their good little hearts lies the
     most craving relish for greatness; it is even said, each chooses
     her husband on the hypothesis of his being a great man--in his way.
     The good creatures, yet the foolish!--_Essay on Goethe's Works._


     She is of that light unreflecting class, of that light unreflecting
     sex: _varium semper et mutabile_. And then her Fine-ladyism, though
     a purseless one: capricious, coquettish, and with all the finer
     sensibilities of the heart; now in the rackets, now in the sullens;
     vivid in contradictory resolves; laughing, weeping, without
     reason,--though these acts are said to be signs of season.
     Consider, too, how she has had to work her way, all along, by
     flattery and cajolery; wheedling, eaves-dropping, namby-pambying;
     how she needs wages, and knows no other productive trades.--_The
     Diamond Necklace._


     Thought can hardly be said to exist in her; only Perception and
     Device. With an understanding lynx-eyed for the surface of things,
     but which pierces beyond the surface of nothing, every individual
     thing (for she has never seized the heart of it) turns up a new
     face to her every new day, and seems a thing changed, a different
     thing.--_The Diamond Necklace._


     Reader! thou for thy sins must have met with such fair Irrationals;
     fascinating, with their lively eyes, with their quick snappish
     fancies; distinguished in the higher circles, in Fashion, even in
     Literature; they hum and buzz there, on graceful
     film-wings:--searching, nevertheless, with the wonderfullest skill
     for honey; _un_tamable as flies!--_The Diamond Necklace._


     Nature is very kind to all children, and to all mothers that are
     true to her.--_Frederick the Great._


     She is of stately figure;--of beautiful still countenance.--A
     completeness, a decision is in this fair female figure; by energy
     she means the spirit that will prompt one to sacrifice himself for
     his country.--_French Revolution._


     A clever, high-mannered, massive-minded old lady; admirable as a
     finished piece of social art, but hardly otherwise
     much.--_Reminiscences._


     Who can account for the taste of females?--_The Diamond Necklace._


     A Beauty, but over light-headed: a Booby who had fine legs. How
     these first courted, billed, and cooed, according to nature; then
     pouted, fretted, grew utterly enraged and blew one another
     up.--_Boswell's Life of Johnson._


     With delicate female tact, with fine female stoicism too, keeping
     all things within limits.--_Frederick the Great._


     A true-hearted, sharp-witted sister.--_Essay of Diderot._


     A graceful, brave, and amiable woman;--her choicest gift an open
     eye and heart.--_Oliver Cromwell._


     Every graceful and generous quality of womanhood harmoniously
     blended in her nature.--_Life of Schiller._


     She is a fair vision, the _beau ideal_ of a poet's first
     mistress.--_Life of Schiller._


     Heaven, though severe, is _not_ unkind; Heaven is kind, as a noble
     mother; as that Spartan mother, saying while she gave her son his
     shield, "With it, my son, or upon it!"--Complain not; the very
     Spartans did not complain.--_Past and Present_.




                    VICTOR HUGO.


     All her face, all her person, breathed an ineffable love and
     kindness. She had always been predestined to gentleness, but Faith,
     Hope, and Charity, those three virtues that softly warm the soul,
     had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity. Nature had only
     made her a lamb, and religion had made her an angel.--_Les
     Miserables._


     She was the very embodiment of joy as she went to and fro in the
     house; she brought with her a perpetual spring.--_Toilers of the
     Sea_.


     Her entire person was simplicity, ingenuousness, whiteness, candor,
     and radiance, and it might have been said of her that she was
     transparent. She produced a sensation of April and daybreak, and
     she had dew in her eyes. She was the condensation of the light of
     dawn in a woman's form.--_Les Miserables._


     The woman was weak, but the mother found strength.--_Ninety-Three._


     Woman feels and speaks with the infallibility which is the tender
     instinct of the heart.--_Les Miserables._


     What is a husband but the pilot in the voyage of matrimony? Wife,
     let your fine weather be your husband's smiles.--_Toilers of the
     Sea._


     No one knows like a woman how to say things which are at once
     gentle and deep. Gentleness and depth,--in these things the whole
     of woman is contained, and it is heaven.--_Les Miserables._


     Beauty heightened by simplicity is ineffable, and nothing is so
     adorable as a beauteous, innocent maiden, who walks along
     unconsciously, holding in her hand the key of Paradise.--_Les
     Miserables._


     She had the prettiest little hands in the world, and little feet
     to match them. Sweetness and goodness reigned throughout her
     person; ... her occupation was only to live her daily life; her
     accomplishments were the knowledge of a few songs; her intellectual
     gifts were summed up in her simple innocence.--_Toilers of the
     Sea._


     The coquette is blind: she does not see her wrinkles.--_By Order of
     the King._


     A mother's arms are made of tenderness, and children sleep soundly
     in them.--_Les Miserables._


     There are moments when a woman accepts, like a sombre and resigned
     duty, the worship of love.--_Les Miserables._


     She was pale with that paleness which is like the transparency of a
     divine life in an earthly face.... A soul standing in the
     dawn.--_By Order of the King._

     He looked at her, and saw nothing but her. This is love; one may be
     carried away for a moment by the importunity of some other idea,
     but the beloved one enters, and all that does not appertain to her
     presence immediately fades away, without her dreaming that perhaps
     she is effacing in us a world.--_By Order of the King._

     She walked on with a light and free step, so little suggestive of
     the burden of life that it might easily be seen that she was young.
     Her movements possessed that subtle grace which indicates the most
     delicate of all transitions--the soft intermingling, as it-were,
     of two twilights,--the passage from the condition of a child to
     that of womanhood.--_Toilers of the Sea._

     She had never been pretty, but her whole life, which had been but a
     succession of pious works, had eventually cast over her a species
     of whiteness and brightness, and in growing older she had acquired
     what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been thinness
     in her youth had became in her maturity transparency, and through
     this transparency the angel could be seen.--_Les Miserables._

     A ray of happiness was visible upon her face. Never had she
     appeared more beautiful. Her features were remarkable for
     prettiness rather than what is called beauty. Their fault, if fault
     it be, lay in a certain excess of grace.... The ideal virgin is the
     transfiguration of a face like this. Deruchette, touched by her
     sorrow and love, seemed to have caught that higher and more holy
     expression. It was the difference between the field daisy and the
     lily.--_Toilers of the Sea._

     The glance of a woman resembles certain wheels which are apparently
     gentle but are formidable.... You come, you go, you dream, you
     speak, you laugh, and all in a minute you feel yourself caught, and
     it is all over with you. The wheel holds you, the glance has caught
     you.--_Les Miserables._

     She had listened to nothing, but mothers hear certain things
     without listening.--_Ninety-Three._

     She was really a respectable, firm, equitable, and just person,
     full of that charity which consists in giving, but not possessing
     to the same extent the charity which comprehends and pardons.--_Les
     Miserables._

     She seemed a vision scarcely embodied; ... in her fairness, which
     amounted almost to serenity of her look; ... in the sacred
     innocence of her smile, she was almost an angel, and yet just a
     woman.--_By Order of the King._

     The girl becomes a maiden, fresh and joyous as the lark. Noting her
     movements, we feel as if it were good of her not to fly away. The
     dear familiar companion moves at her own sweet will about the
     house; flits from branch to branch, or rather from room to room;
     goes to and fro; approaches and retires.... She asks a question and
     is answered; is asked something in return, and chirps a reply. It
     is delightful to chat with her when tired of serious talk; for this
     creature carries with her something of her skyey element. She is,
     as it were, a thread of gold interwoven with your sombre thoughts;
     you feel almost grateful to her for her kindness in not making
     herself invisible, when it would be so easy for her to be even
     impalpable; for the beautiful is a necessity of life. There is in
     the world no function more important than that of being
     charming.... To shed joy around, to radiate happiness, to cast
     light upon dark days, to be the golden thread of our destiny, and
     the very spirit of grace and harmony, is not this to render a
     service?--_Toilers of the Sea._

     She scarcely knew, perhaps, the meaning of the word love, and yet
     not unwillingly ensnared those about her in the toils.--_Toilers of
     the Sea._

     She stopped. She walked back a few paces, stopped again; she
     inclined her head, with those thoughtful eyes which look attentive
     yet see nothing.... Her lowered eyelids had that vague contraction
     which suggests a tear checked in its course, or a thought
     suppressed.... Her face, which might inspire adoration, seemed
     meditative, like portraits of the Virgin.--_Toilers of the Sea._

     She broke the bread into two fragments, and gave them to the
     children, who ate with avidity. "She has kept none for herself,"
     grumbled the sergeant. "Because she is not hungry," said a soldier.
     "Because she is a mother," said the sergeant.--_Ninety-Three._

     Extreme simplicity touches on extreme coquetry.... They did not
     speak, they did not bow, they did not know each other, but they
     met; and like the stars in the heavens, they lived by looking at
     each other. It was thus that she gradually became a woman, and was
     developed into a beautiful and loving woman, conscious of her
     beauty and ignorant of her love. She was a coquette into the
     bargain, through her innocence.--_Les Miserables._

     Does not beauty confer a benefit upon us, even by the simple fact
     of being beautiful?--Here and there we meet with one who possesses
     that fairy-like power of enchanting all about her; sometimes she is
     ignorant herself of this magical influence, which is, however, for
     that reason only the more perfect. Her presence lights up the home;
     her approach is like cheerful warmth; she passes by, and we are
     content; she stays awhile, and we are happy.--_Toilers of the Sea._

     To behold her is to live; she is the Aurora with a human face. She
     has no need to do more than simply to be, she makes an Eden of the
     house; Paradise breathes from her: and she communicates this
     delight to all, without taking any greater trouble than that of
     existing beside them. Is it not a thing divine to have a smile
     which, none know how, has the power to lighten the weight of that
     enormous chain which all the living, in common, drag behind
     them?--_Toilers of the Sea._

     On the day when a woman who passes before you emits light as she
     walks you are lost, for you love. You have from that moment but one
     thing to do: think of her so intently that she will be compelled to
     think of you.--_Les Miserables._

     The soul only needs to see a smile in a white crepe bonnet in order
     to enter the palace of dreams.--_Les Miserables._

     She had upon her lips almost the light of a smile, with the fulness
     of tears in her eyes.... The reflection of an angel was in her
     look.--_Toilers of the Sea._




                    ROBERT BROWNING.


    There is a vision in the heart of each
    Of justice, mercy, wisdom, tenderness
    To wrong and pain, and knowledge of its cure:
    And these embodied in a woman's form
    That best transmits them, pure as first received,
    From God above her, to mankind below.

      _Colombe's Birthday._


          This woman ...
    ... Being true, devoted, constant--she
    Found constancy, devotion, truth, the plain
    And easy commonplace of character.


      _The Inn Album._


    ... The good and tender heart,
    Its girl's trust and its woman's constancy,
    How pure yet passionate, how calm yet kind,
    How grave yet joyous, how reserved yet free
    As light where friends are--how imbued with lore
    The world most prizes, yet the simplest.
           *       *       *       *       *
          Herself creates
    The want she means to satisfy.

      _A Blot on the 'Scutcheon._


    Truly, the woman's way
    High to lift heart up.

      _Agamemnon._


          And Michal's face
    Still wears that quiet and peculiar light
    Like the dim circlet floating 'round a pearl.
           *       *       *       *       *
    And yet her calm sweet countenance,
    Though saintly, was not sad; for she would sing
    Alone ... bird-like,
    Not dreaming you were near.--Her carols dropt
    In flakes through that old leafy bower.

      _Paracelsus._


    ... Such a lady, cheeks so round and lips so red,--
    On her neck the small face buoyant like a bell-flower on its bed.

      _Lyric._


  There's a woman like a dew-drop, she's so purer than the purest;
  And her noble heart's the noblest, yes, and her sure faith's the surest;
  And her eyes are dark and humid, like the depth on depth of lustre
  Hid i' the harebell, while her tresses, sunnier than the wild-grape cluster,
  Gush in golden-tinted plenty down her neck's rose-misted marble;
  Then her voice's music ... call it the well's bubbling, the bird's warble!

      _A Blot on the 'Scutcheon._


    How twinks thine eye, my Love,
    Blue as yon star-beam.

      _Ferishtah's Fancies._


    That flower-like love of hers;
           *       *       *       *       *
    She was true--she only of them all!
    True to her eyes, ... those glorious eyes.
           *       *       *       *       *
    With truth and purity go other gifts.
    All gifts come clustering to that.

      _The Return of the Druses._


          Good as beautiful is she,
    With gifts that match her goodness, no faint flaw
    I' the white;--she were the pearl you think you saw.

      _Daniel Bartoli._


          Since beneath my roof
    Housed she who made home heaven, in heaven's behoof
    I went forth every day, and all day long
    Worked for the world. Look, how the laborer's song
    Cheers him! Thus sang my soul, at each sharp throe
    Of laboring flesh and blood--"She loves me so!"

      _A Forgiveness._


    It is conspicuous in a woman's nature
    Before its view to take a grace for granted:
    Too trustful,--on her boundary, usurpature
    Is swftly made;
    But swftly, too, decayed,
    The glory perishes by woman vaunted.

      _Agamemnon._


    That fawn-skin-dappled hair of hers;
          And the blue eye
          Dear and dewy,
    And that infantine fresh air of hers!
           *       *       *       *       *
          Eyes and mouth too,
    All the face composed of flowers....
           *       *       *       *       *
    ... The sweet face ...
        Be its beauty
        Its sole duty!

      _A Pretty Woman._


    Women hate a debt as
    Men a gift.

      _In a Balcony._


    A pretty woman's worth some pains to see,
    Nor is she spoiled, I take it, if a crown
    Complete the forehead pale and tresses pure.

      _Colombe's Birthday._


    Sure, 'tis no woman's part to long for battle;
           *       *       *       *       *
    Who conquers mildly
    God from afar benignantly regardeth.

      _Agamemnon._


    Man's best and woman's worse
    Amount so nearly to the same thing.

      _Daniel Bartoli._


          Nature's law ...
    Given the peerless woman, certainly
    Somewhere shall be the peerless man to match.

      _The Inn Album._


    Show me where's the woman won without
    The help of one lie which she believes--
    That--never mind how things have come to pass,
    And let who loves have loved a thousand times--
    All the same he now loves her only, loves
    Her ever....

      _The Inn Album._


    Girl with sparkling eyes....
           *       *       *       *       *
    What an angelic mystery you are--
           *       *       *       *       *
    You have a full fresh joyous sense of life
    That finds you out life's fit food everywhere;
           *       *       *       *       *
    By joyance you inspire joy.

      _The Inn Album._


          Now makes twice
    That I have seen her, walked and talked
    With the poor pretty thoughtful thing,
    Whose worth I weigh; she tries to sing:
    Draws, hopes in time the eye grows nice;
    Reads verse and thinks she understands;
    Loves all, at any rate, that's great,
    Good, beautiful....

      _Dis Aliter Visum._


    Wave my lady dear a last farewell,
    Lamenting who to one and all of us
    Domestics was a mother, myriad harms
    She used to ward away from every one,
    And mollify her husband's ireful mood.

      _Balaustion's Adventure._


          Men? say you have the power
    To make them yours, rule men, throughout life's little hour,
    According to the phrase: what follows?
          Men, you make,
    By ruling them, your own; each man for his own sake
    Accepts you as his guide, avails him of what worth
    He apprehends in you to sublimate his earth
    With fire; content, if so you convey him through night,
    That you shall play the sun, and he, the satellite,
    Pilfer your light and heat and virtue, starry pelf,
    While, caught up by your course, he turns upon himself.

      _Fifine at the Fair._


          Any sort of woman may bestow
    Her atom on the star, or clod she counts for such,--
    Each little making less bigger by just that much.
    Women grow you, while men depend on you at best.

      _Fifine at the Fair._


    Woman, and will you cast
    For a word, quite off at last
        Me your own, your You,--
    Love, if you knew the light
    That your soul casts in my sight,
        How I look to you
        For the pure and true,
    And the beauteous and the right,--
    Bear with a moment's spite
    When a mere mote threats the white!

      _A Lover's Quarrel._


    Love, you did give all I asked, I think--
    More than I merit, yes, by many times.
    And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,
    But had you--oh, with the same perfect brow,
    And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird
    The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare--
    Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!
    Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged,
    "God and the glory! never care for gain;
    The present by the future, what is that?
    Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!
    Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!"
    I might have done it for you. So it seems;
    Perhaps not. All is as God overrules.

      _Andrea Del Sarto._


          All women love great men
    If young or old; it is in all the tales;
    Young beauties love old poets who can love--
           *       *       *       *       *
    Who was a queen and loved a poet once
    Humpbacked, a dwarf? ah, women can do that!

      _In a Balcony._


          For women
    There is no good of life but love--but love!
    What else looks good, is some shade flung from love;
    Love gilds it, gives it worth. Be warned by me.
    Never you cheat yourself one instant! Love,
    Give love, ask only love, and leave the rest!

      _In a Balcony._


        Oh, the beautiful girl ...
    ... Her flesh was the soft seraphic screen
    Of a soul that is meant ...
      To just see earth, and hardly be seen,
    And blossom in heaven instead.
    Yet earth saw one thing, one how fair?
      One grace that grew to its full ...
    ... She had her great gold hair.

    Hair, such a wonder of flix and floss,
      Freshness and fragrance--floods of it, too!
    Gold, did I say? Nay, gold's mere dross!

      _Gold Hair._


          She had
    A heart--how shall I say?--too soon made glad,
    Too easily impressed: she liked whate'er
    She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
           *       *       *       *       *
    'Twas all one! My favour at her breast,
    The dropping of the daylight in the West,
    The bough of cherries some officious fool
    Broke in the orchard for her,--all and each
    Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
    Or blush at least ...
    ... Who'd stoop to blame
    This sort of trifling?

      _My Last Duchess._




                    W. M. THACKERAY.


     To be doing good for some one else, is the life of most good women.
     They are exuberant of kindness, as it were, and must impart it to
     some one.--_Henry Esmond._


     Who ever accused women of being just? They are always sacrificing
     themselves or somebody for somebody else's sake.--_Pendennis._


     I think it is not national prejudice which makes me believe that a
     high-bred English lady is the most complete of all Heaven's
     subjects in this world. In whom else do you see so much grace, and
     so much virtue; so much faith, and so much tenderness; with such a
     perfect refinement and chastity? And by high-bred ladies I don't
     mean duchesses and countesses. Be they ever so high in station,
     they can be but ladies, and no more. But almost every man who lives
     in the world has the happiness, let us hope, of counting a few such
     persons amongst his circle of acquaintance,--women, in whose
     angelical natures there is something awful, as well as beautiful,
     to contemplate; at whose feet the wildest and fiercest of us must
     fall down and humble ourselves, in admiration of that adorable
     purity which never seems to do or to think wrong.--_Pendennis._


     What kind-hearted woman, young or old, does not love
     match-making?--_The Newcomes._


     Who does not know how ruthlessly women will tyrannize when they are
     let to domineer? And who does not know how useless advice is?... A
     man gets his own experience about women, and will take nobody's
     hearsay; nor, indeed, is the young fellow worth a fig that
     would.--_Henry Esmond._


     Stupid! Why not? Some women ought to be stupid. What you call
     dullness I call repose. Give me a calm woman, a slow woman,--a
     lazy, majestic woman. Show me a gracious virgin bearing a lily;
     not a leering giggler frisking a rattle. A lively woman would be
     the death of me.... Why shouldn't the Sherrick be stupid, I say?
     About great beauty there should always reign a silence. As you look
     at the great stars, the great ocean, any great scene of nature, you
     hush, sir. You laugh at a pantomime, but you are still in a temple.
     When I saw the great Venus of the Louvre, I thought,--Wert thou
     alive, O goddess, thou shouldst never open those lovely lips but to
     speak lowly, slowly; thou shouldst never descend from that pedestal
     but to walk stately to some near couch, and assume another attitude
     of beautiful calm. To be beautiful is enough. If a woman can do
     that well; who shall demand more from her? You don't want a rose to
     sing. And I think wit is as out of place where there's great
     beauty; as I wouldn't have a queen to cut jokes on her
     throne.--_The Newcomes._


     And so it is,--a pair of bright eyes with a dozen glances suffice
     to subdue a man; to enslave him, and inflame him; to make him even
     forget; they dazzle him so that the past becomes straightway dim to
     him; and he would give all his life to possess 'em.--_Henry
     Esmond._


     She is as good a little creature as can be. She is never out of
     temper; I don't think she is very wise; but she is uncommonly
     pretty, and her beauty grows on you.... I look at her like a little
     wild-flower in a field,--like a little child at play, sir. Pretty
     little tender nursling. If I see her passing in the street I feel
     as if I would like some fellow to be rude to her that I might have
     the pleasure of knocking him down. She is like a little songbird,
     sir,--a tremulous, fluttering little linnet that you would take
     into your hand, and smooth its little plumes, and let it perch on
     your finger and sing.--_The Newcomes._


     That fine blush which is her pretty symbol of youth, modesty, and
     beauty.... I never saw such a beautiful violet as that of her eyes.
     Her complexion is of the pink of the blush-rose.--_The Newcomes._


     He thought and wondered at the way in which women play with men,
     and coax them and win them and drop them.--_Pendennis._


     It was this lady's disposition to think kindnesses, and devise
     silent bounties and to scheme benevolence, for those about her. We
     take such goodness, for the most part, as if it were our due; the
     Marys who bring ointment for our feet get but little thanks. Some
     of us never feel this devotion at all, or are moved by it to
     gratitude or acknowledgment; others only recall it years after,
     when the days are past in which those sweet kindnesses were spent
     on us, and we offer back our return for the debt by a poor tardy
     payment of tears. The forgotten tones of love recur to us, and kind
     glances shine out of the past--O so bright and clear!--O so longed
     after! because they are out of reach; as holiday music from
     with-inside a prison wall--or sunshine seen through the bars; more
     prized because unattainable, more bright because of the contrast of
     present darkness and solitude, whence there is no escape.--_Henry
     Esmond._


     In houses where, in place of that sacred, inmost flame of love,
     there is discord at the centre, the whole household becomes
     hypocritical, and each lies to his neighbor.... Alas that youthful
     love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy.... 'Tis a
     hard task for women in life, that mask which the world bids them
     wear. But there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill
     used and unhappy to show that she is so. The world is quite
     relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face.--_Henry
     Esmond._


     O, what a mercy it is that these women do not exercise their powers
     oftener. We can't resist them if they do. Let them show ever so
     little inclination and men go down on their knees at once; old or
     ugly it is all the same, and this I set down as a positive truth. A
     woman with fair opportunities, and without an absolute hump, may
     marry whom she likes. Only let us be thankful that the darlings are
     like the beasts of the field and don't know their own powers. They
     would overcome us entirely if they did.--_The Newcomes._


     As for women--O my dear friends and brethren in this vale of
     tears--did you ever see anything so curious and monstrous and
     annoying as the way in which women court Princekin when he is
     marriageable!--_The Newcomes._


     She was as gentle and amenable to reason, as good-natured a girl
     as could be; a little vacant and silly, but some men like dolls for
     wives.--_The Newcomes._


     She had been bred to measure her actions by a standard which the
     world may nominally admit, but which it leaves for the most part
     unheeded. Worship, love, duty, as taught her by the devout study of
     the sacred law which interprets and defines it--if these formed the
     outward practice of her life, they were also its constant and
     secret endeavor and occupation. She spoke but very seldom of her
     religion, though it filled her heart and influenced all her
     behavior. What must the world appear to such a person?--_The
     Newcomes._


     There are ladies, who may be called men's women, being welcomed
     entirely by all the gentlemen, and cut or slighted by all their
     wives.... But while simple folks who are out of the world, or
     country people with a taste for the genteel, behold these ladies in
     their seeming glory in public places, or envy them from afar off,
     persons who are better instructed could inform them that these
     envied ladies have no more chance of establishing themselves in
     "Society," than the benighted squire's wife in Somersetshire, who
     reads of their doings in the _Morning Post_. Men living about town
     are aware of these awful truths. You hear how pitilessly many
     ladies of seeming rank and wealth are excluded from this "Society."
     The frantic efforts which they make to enter this circle, the
     meannesses to which they submit, the insults which they undergo,
     are matters of wonder to those who take human or woman kind for a
     study; and the pursuit of fashion under difficulties would be a
     fine theme for any very great person who had the wit, the leisure,
     and the knowledge of the English language necessary for the
     compiling of such a history.--_Vanity Fair._


     I can fancy nothing more cruel than to have to sit day after day
     with a dull handsome woman opposite; to answer her speeches about
     the weather, housekeeping, and what not.... Women go through this
     simpering and smiling life and bear it quite easily. Theirs is a
     life of hypocrisy. What good woman does not laugh at her husband's
     or father's jokes and stories time after time and would not laugh
     at breakfast, lunch, and dinner if he told them? Flattery is their
     nature,--to coax, flatter, and sweetly befool some one is every
     woman's business. She is none, if she declines this office.--_The
     Newcomes._


     He had placed himself at her feet so long that the poor little
     woman had been accustomed to trample upon him. She didn't wish to
     marry him, but she wished to keep him. She wished to give him
     nothing, but that he should give her all. It is a bargain not
     unfrequently levied in love.--_Vanity Fair._


     Every woman would rather be beautiful, than be anything else in the
     world,--ever so rich, or ever so good, or have all the gifts of the
     fairies.--_The Virginians._


     If a man is in grief, who cheers him; in trouble, who consoles
     him; in wrath, who soothes him; in joy, who makes him doubly happy;
     in prosperity, who rejoices; in disgrace, who backs him against the
     world, and dresses with gentle unguents and warm poultices the
     rankling wounds made by the stings and arrows of outrageous
     Fortune? Who but woman, if you please? You who are ill and sore
     from the buffets of Fate, have you one or two of these sweet
     physicians? Return thanks to the gods that they have left you so
     much of consolation. What gentleman is not more or less a
     Prometheus? Who has not his rock, his chain? But the sea-nymphs
     come,--the gentle, the sympathizing; ... they do their blessed best
     to console us Titans; _they_ don't turn their backs upon us after
     our overthrow.--_The Virginians._


     Is not a young mother one of the sweetest sights which life shows
     us? If she has been beautiful before, does not her present pure joy
     give a character of refinement and sacredness almost to her beauty,
     touch her sweet cheeks with fairer blushes, and impart I know not
     what serene brightness to her eyes?--_The Newcomes._


     This lady moved through the world quite regardless of all the
     comments that were made in her praise or disfavor. She did not seem
     to know that she was admired or hated for being so perfect, but
     went on calmly through life, saving her prayers, loving her family,
     helping her neighbors, and doing good.--_Pendennis._


     She had a fault of character which flawed her perfections. With
     the other sex perfectly tolerant and kindly, of her own she was
     invariably jealous; and a proof that she had this vice is, that
     though she would acknowledge a thousand faults that she had not, to
     which she had she could never be got to own.--_Henry Esmond._


     She was a critic, not by reason, but by feeling. Feeling was her
     reason.--_Henry Esmond._


     Her eyes were gray; her voice low and sweet: and her smile when it
     lighted up her face and eyes as beautiful as spring sunshine, also,
     they could brighten and flash often, and sometimes though rarely
     rain.--_Pendennis._

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
