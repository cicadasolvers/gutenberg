[Transcriber's note: Original spelling varieties have not been
standardized. Characters with macrons or accents have been marked in
brackets: examples are an e with an equal sign as in [=e] for a letter e
with a macron on top; [^a] for a letter a with circumflex accent; [/e]
and [\e] for the letter e with acute or grave accents. The pilcrow sign
has been rendered as [P]; the legal paragraph sign as [para].
Underscores have been used to indicate _italic_ fonts. In footnote 4,
[Greek: estian], as taken over from Byron's text, seems to be a
typographical error for [Greek: hestian]. A list of volumes and pages in
"Notes and Queries" has been added at the end.]

Notes.


PROVERBIAL PHILOSOPHY.

The following "sententious truths" are extracted from Bishop
Jewel's grand performance, _A Defense of the Apologie of the
Churche of Englande_, fol. 1571, a work as remarkable for "the
pomp and charms" of its eloquence, as for the profound erudition,
and the consummate ability, with which its "good doctrine" is
exhibited and enforced. In common, however, with the other
productions of this illustrious champion of the Reformation, it
has an additional and most attractive feature; one, indeed, which,
less or more, characterises all the literary achievements of the
gigantic geniuses of the Elizabethan period, the "very dust of
whose writings is gold."[1] The "Defense" abounds with _proverbial
folk-lore_ of the rarest sort; and this is so skilfully and
appositely introduced, that the subject-matter presents itself to
the reader's mind rather as a corollary, naturally deduced from a
self-evident proposition--for who would think for a moment of
questioning the truth of what has the semblance of a popular
adage?[2]--than as a nicely managed argument, which receives no
other help from the latter than that of illustration, employed for
the simple and single purpose, not of strengthening such argument,
but of rendering it comprehensible by the "meanest capacities."

  [Footnote 1: Bentley, of Bp. Pearson, in _Dissert. on Phalaris._]

  [Footnote 2: I have somewhere met with an amusing instance of
  this. It seems that Dean Swift, with a party of friends, were
  invited to view the garden of a gentleman, the walls of which were
  laden with peaches of a most tempting ripeness, but which they
  were strictly forbidden to touch. This injunction was followed,
  until Swift ('twas like him) at length put forth his hand and
  plucked, at the same time observing, with all becoming gravity,
  "As my deeply venerated grandmother used to say,

      'Never fail to pluck a peach,
      Whene'er you find one in your reach.'"

  'Twas enough. The authority of the adage was sufficient to
  overrule every other obligation; and the rest of the company, much
  to the disgust of the master of the garden, immediately proceeded,
  with infinite gusto, to follow the Dean's example, not for a
  moment doubting the propriety of the act. "The court awards it,
  and the law doth give it."]

With this little bit of criticism, let me take the liberty of
recommending to such of your readers, and I trust they are many, who
seek for knowledge and wisdom in the richly-stored tomes, especially of
the divines, whose appearance imparted a further glory to the days of
our "good queen Bess," to note down the "wise saws and modern instances"
which lie scattered along their glowing periods, like "dew-drops on the
flow'ry lawn," for the purpose of transferring them to your very
appropriate pages.

The remark of our old lexicographer, Florio[3], that "daily both new
words are invented, and books still found that make a new supply of
old," may, in its latter part, very fitly be applied to our proverbial
philosophy; for, great as is the light which has already been thrown
upon the subject, it must be admitted that a more _systematic_
examination than they have yet received, of the works of the Elizabethan
writers, would elucidate it to an extent that can scarcely be
appreciated.

  [Footnote 3: _Worlde of Wordes_, Ital. and Eng. Pr. 1598.]

With these observations I offer you my little string of pearls, under
the hope that row after row may be added to it.

  "1. A contentious man wil never lacke wordes.

  2. A Judge must walke with feete of lead.

  3. An ignorante Judge was never indifferente.

  4. A simple eie is soone beguiled.

  5. By a smal draughte of sea-water, though maiste judge the
  verdure of the whole.

  6. Error can not be defended, but by error.

  7. Evils must be cured by theire contraries.

  8. He is very doumbe, and can speak but little, that cannot speake
  ill.

  9. He that cannot judge Golde by sounde, or in sight, yet may trie
  it by the poise.

  10. Il wil is ever plentiful of il woordes.

  11. In the fairest rose thou maiste soonest finde a canker.

  12. It is a desperate cause, that with woordes and eloquence maie
  not be smoothed.

  13. It is very course woulle that will take no colour.

  14. Let Reason leade thee; let Authoritie move thee; let Truthe
  enforce thee.

  15. Of an Impossibilitie yee maie conclude what yee liste.

  16. Oftentimes he is hardiest man to speake, that hathe leaste to
  saie.

  17. One demanded this question of Zoilus the Railer: Why takest
  thou sutche pleasure in speaking il? Zoilus made answere, Bicause,
  whereas I woulde doo it, I am not hable.

  18. Rashe judgemente argueth somme folie.

  19. The Heares of a mannes Bearde, or Heade, never ware white al
  togeather.

  20. The mouthe which speaketh untruth killeth the soule.

  21. The report of an enimie maketh no proufe.

  22. The slowe paced horses kepe backe the chariot.

  23. The Truthe wilbe hable evermore to beare it selfe.

  24. To mainteine a fault knowne, is a double faulte.

  25. To spende woordes without cause, is affliction of the sprite,
  and losse of time.

  26. Vesselles never geve so great a sounde, as when they be
  emptie.

  27. Untruthe cannot be shielded, but by untruthe.

  28. Where the woulfe is broken in, it is beste for the poor sheepe
  to breake out."

It is as well to remark that the above aphorisms are contained within
the first 365 pages of the "Defense." Their orthography and punctuation
have been carefully preserved, as they ought always to be in such like
cases. Some of them I have not elsewhere met with, and others present
_variae lectiones_ of an interesting character. They are all delivered in
a quaint simplicity of style, which admirably illustrates the general
tone of thought and language of the period.

PARAPHRASE ON THE 137TH PSALM BY CHURCHILL.

A paraphrase of the 137th psalm by Charles Churchill may, perhaps, be
deemed not unworthy of a place amongst your Notes. It was originally
sent to Mrs. Baily of Cadbury, who had remonstrated with him on his
devoting his pen exclusively to satire. That lady gave them to my
maternal grandfather. Three lines of the last verse are lost.

      "'Raise, raise your voice,' the victors say,
        'Touch, touch the trembling string,
      In Sion's manner briskly play,
        In Sion's manner sing.'

      "Our voice, alas! how should we raise
        In Babylonish ground?
      How should we sing Jehovah's praise
        In Pagan fetters bound?

        Nor let thy anger sleep,
      Let their own wishes on them light,
        In turn let Edom weep.

        Shall Babylon surround,

UPON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MEDICEAN VENUS IN THE 4TH CANTO OF CHILDE

      LI.

      "Appear'dst thou not to Paris in this guise?
      Or to more deeply blest Anchises? or,
      In all thy perfect goddess-ship, when lies
      Before thee thy own vanquished Lord of War?
      And gazing in thy face as toward a star
      Laid on thy lap, his eyes to thee upturn,
      Feeding on thy sweet cheek![4] while thy lips are
      With lava kisses melting while they burn,
      Showered on his eyelids, brow, and mouth, as from an urn!

      LII.

      Glowing, and circumfused in speechless love,
      Their full divinity inadequate
      That feeling to express, or to improve,
      The gods become as mortals, and man's fate
      Has moments like their brightest ----" &c. &c.

  [Footnote 4: To these beautiful and glowing lines the author has
  appended the following:


            "[Greek: Ophthalmous estian.]"
      "Atque oculos pascat uterque suos."

      OVID. _Amor._ lib. iii.]

It seems to me that the noble poet has condescended to avail himself of
a little _ruse_ in referring to this passage of Ovid. It would have been
perhaps more honest to have referred his readers to those magnificent
lines in the opening address to Venus, by Lucretius, "De Rerum Natur[^a],"
beginning,--

      "AEneadum genitrix, hominum div[^o]mque voluptas,
      Alma Venus!" &c.

I subjoin the verses which Lord Byron _really_ had in mind when he wrote
the foregoing stanzas:

      "Nam tu sola potes tranquill[^a] pace juvare
      Mortaleis: quoniam belli fera moenera Mavors
      Armipotens regit, _in gremium_ qui saepe _tuum se_
      Rejieit, aeterno devictus volnere Amoris:
      Atque _ita, suspiciens_ tereti cervice reposta
      _Pascit amore avidos, inhians in te, Dea, visus;_
      Eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore.
      Hunc tu, Diva, tuo recubantem corpore sancto
      _Circumfusa super_, suaveis ex ore loquelas
      Funde, petens placidam Romanis, incluta, pacem."

Surely if the author of _Childe Harold_ were indebted to _any_ ancient
poet for some ideas embodied in the lines cited, it was to Lucretius and
not to Ovid that he should have owned the obligation.

Minor Notes.

_On the Word "raised" as used by the Americans._--An American, in answer
to an inquiry as to the place of his birth, says, "I was _raised_ in New
York," &c. Was it ever an English phrase? And if so, by what English
writer of celebrity was it ever used? Dr. Franklin, in a letter to John
Alleyne, Esq., Aug. 9, 1768, says:

  "By these early marriages we are blest with more children; and
  from the mode among us, founded in nature, of every mother
  suckling and nursing her own child, more of them are _raised_."

_A Ship's Berth._--Compilers of Dictionaries have attempted to show, but
I think without success, that this word has been derived from one of the
meanings of the verb _to bear_. I conjecture that it has been derived
from the Welsh word _porth_, a port or harbour. This word is under
certain circumstances written _borth_, according to the rules of Welsh
grammar. A ship's place in harbour (_borth_) is her _berth_. A sailor's
place in his ship is his _berth_.

Queries.


JOHN A KENT AND JOHN A CUMBER.

I am much obliged to you, Mr. Editor, for giving additional circulation
to my inquiry (through the medium of the _Athenaeum_ of the 19th ult.)
regarding the two ancient popular wizards, John a Kent and John a
Cumber. I was aware, from a note received some time ago from my friend
the Rev. John Webb of Tretire, that there are various current traditions
in Monmouthshire, and that Coxe's history of that county contains some
information regarding one of these worthies. That fact has since been
repeated to me by a gentleman of Newport, who wrote in consequence of
what appeared in the _Athenaeum_, and whose name I do not know that I am
at liberty to mention. I may, however, take this opportunity of thanking
him, as well as the transmitter of the curious particulars printed in
the _Athenaeum_ of Saturday last.

One point I wish to ascertain is, whence John a Kent derived his
appellation? This question has not been at all answered. Has his name
any connexion, and what, with the village of Kentchurch, in
Monmouthshire; and why was the place called Kentchurch? To what saint is
the church dedicated? and has the name of that church anything to do
with the name of the saint? Anthony Munday (or Mundy), in his MS. play
(now in my hands by the favour of the Hon. Mr. Mostyn, and by the kind
interposition of Sir F. Madden), does not give the slightest clue to
the "birth, parentage, and education" of John a Kent. As to John a
Cumber, all we learn is, that he was a Scottish conjuror, employed by a
nobleman of the same country to counteract the proceedings of John a
Kent, who is represented as in the service of Sir Gosselin Denville, a
person who appears, from what Munday says, to have had power and
influence in South Wales.

Now, the name of Sir Gosselin Denville itself suggests a Query; because
I find in Johnson's _Lives of Highwayman, &c.,_ fol. 1734, p. 15. (I do
not of course refer to it as a book of any authority), that there was a
celebrated collector of tribute from travellers who bore that name and
rank. He, however, came from Yorkshire, and lived (according to the
narrative of Johnson, who had it most likely from Capt. A. Smith, whose
work I have not at hand) as long ago as the reign of Edward II. Let me
ask, therefore, whether there exist any tidings respecting such a person
as a native of Wales, and as the "master" (I use Munday's word) of John
a Kent?

But this is not the principal object of my present communication, which
relates to one of the heroines of Munday's drama--a daughter of
Llewellin, Prince of North Wales. To her the name of Sidanen is given,
and she is constantly spoken of as "the fair Sidanen," with the
additional information, in one place, that "sonnets" had been written in
her praise. Every person who sends a Query must plead ignorance, and
mine may be great as regards Welsh poetry, when I inquire, who was
Sidanen, and where has she been celebrated? By the second volume of
_Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers' Company_ (printed for
the Shakspeare Society), it is evident that she was well known about the
middle of the reign of Elizabeth, for on p. 94. I read the following
entry:--

      "xiii Augusti [1580]

  "Rich. Jones. Rd. of him for printinge a ballat of brittishe
  Sidanen, applied by a courtier to the praise of the Queen."

British Sidanen probably meant Sidanen of Ancient Britain, or Wales, to
whom some unnamed and adulatory courtier had compared Queen Elizabeth. I
fancied also that I recollected, in Warner's _Albion's England_, some
allusion to Elizabeth under the name of Sidanen, but I cannot at present
find it.

As I have my pen in hand, may I add another word, quite upon a different
subject: it is upon the _nimium_ (pardon the word) _vexata questio_
about _esile_, as it is spelt in the first and second folios of
_Hamlet_. Have any of your correspondents, from MR. SINGER to MR.
CAMPKIN, with all their learning and ingenuity, been able at all to
settle the point? Surely, then, I cannot be blamed for not taking upon
me dogmatically to decide it eight years ago. I stated the two positions
assumed by adverse commentators, and what more could I do? What more
have your friends done? The principle I went upon was to make my notes
as short as possible; and after pages on pages have been employed in
your miscellany, it seems, in my humble judgment, that the case is not
one jot altered. _Esile_ may still either mean vinegar (eyesel) or the
river Eisell.

SWEARING ON THE HORNS AT HIGHGATE.

Can any of your readers give a satisfactory explanation of what Lord
Byron, in the LXXth stanza of the first canto of _Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage_, calls the _worship of the solemn horn_? The whole stanza is
as follows:

      "Some o'er thy Thamis row the ribbon'd fair,
      Others along the safer turnpike fly;
      Some Richmond Hill ascend, some send to Ware,
      And many to the steep of Highgate hie.
      Ask ye, Boeotian shades! the reason why? (15)
      'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,
      Grasp'd in the holy hand of mystery,
      In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,
      And consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn!"

And the note (15) merely refers to the poet's writing from Thebes, the
capital of Boeotia.

I have a faint recollection of a circumstance which occurred on a
journey from York to town some forty years ago, and which I almost fancy
may throw some distant light on Lord B.'s horn. Among the inside
passengers by the stage was a middle-aged Yorkshireman, apparently a
small farmer, who kept the rest in a continual titter with his account
of various personal adventures, which he related in a style of quaint
and ludicrous simplicity; and as, in the course of conversation, it
appeared that he had never visited the metropolis before, it was
suggested by a couple of wags, that on the arrival of the coach at
Highgate he should be invited "to make himself free of the Horns."
Accordingly, when in due time the vehicle halted at the above-mentioned
place, and the inside passengers, with the exception of York, had
quitted it, an ostler, having received his cue, appeared at the door
with a pole, to which we attached a pair of gilded ram's horns; and
inquired if the "genelman" from Yorkshire, who was on his first visit to
London, wished to obtain his freedom by swearing on the horns, or would
rather forego the ceremony by a payment of the customary fee. The
Yorkshireman was evidently taken aback by the unexpected question; but,
after a moment's hesitation, intimated that he preferred the horns to
forking out the cash. He was thereupon directed with mock solemnity to
place his right hand upon the horns, and to follow the ostler in
reciting a ridiculous formula; which, if I remember right, consisted in
his vowing, under certain penalties, to prefer wine to water, roast beef
and ale to a dry crust and water gruel, the daughter to the mother, the
sister to the brother, laughing to crying, and songs and glees to
requiems and psalms, &c.

Can you then oblige me with any information respecting the worship of
the solemn horn alluded to by Lord Byron; and, secondly, with any
account respecting the solemn farce of swearing in strangers on the
horns when reaching Highgate on their first visit to the metropolis,
which farce I presume has long since been exploded by the introduction
of the railway.

    KEWENSIS.

  [Moore, in his edition of Byron's _Works_, has the following note
  on this passage:--"Lord Byron alludes to a ridiculous custom which
  formerly prevailed at the public-houses in Highgate, of
  administering a burlesque oath to all travellers of the middling
  rank who stopped there. The party was sworn on a pair of horns,
  fastened, 'never to kiss the maid when he could kiss the mistress;
  never to eat brown bread when he could get white; never to drink
  small beer when he could get strong;' with many other injunctions
  of the like kind, to all which was added the saving clause,
  'unless you like it best.'" Our correspondent, W. S. GIBSON, Esq.,
  in his _Prize Essay on the History and Antiquities of Highgate_,
  has preserved some curious notices of this burlesque oath. He
  says, "All attempts to trace the once prevalent, but now obsolete,
  custom of 'swearing at Highgate' to any really probable source
  have proved unavailing, and the custom has fallen into disuse. The
  early identity of the site of the present hamlet with the ancient
  forest, and the vicinity of Highgate to a park or chase, naturally
  suggests the possible connexion of these trophies with huntsmen
  and their horns; and it is not difficult to perceive that the
  spoils and emblems of the chase, and the hunter's joyous horn, may
  in time have acquired the character of household gods, and at
  length, become like the sword of the warrior, a sacred emblem upon
  which vows were taken, and the most binding engagements made. It
  is, however, less difficult to imagine the reality of such an
  origin, than to account for the strange degeneracy exhibited in
  the modern aspect of the custom. 'Swearing on the horns' was an
  observance at all events more than a century old; for a song which
  embodied a close paraphrase of the oath, according to the best
  authorised version yet extant, was introduced in a London
  pantomime at the Haymarket Theatre in the year 1742."]


Minor Queries.

42. _Proverb of James I._--In the _Miscellaneous State Papers_
(published 1778), vol. i. p. 462., we find Steenie (the Duke of
Buckingham) writing to his royal master as follows:--

  "Give my leave here to use your own proverb,--_For this the devil
  cone me no thanks._"

At the risk of being thought very dull, I ask, what is _cone_, and what
is the meaning of the proverb? James was no _ignoramus_, after all.

44. _Amadis de Gaule, Early Translation of._--I have lately purchased a
black-letter volume, dated 1595. The first part has no title, but the
second is called,--

  "The Second Booke of Amadis de Gaule, containing the description,
  wonders, and conquest of the Firme-Island. The triumphes and
  troubles of Amadis. His manifold victories obtained, and sundry
  services done for King Lisuart. The kinges ingratitude, and first
  occasion of those broils and mortal wars, that no small time
  continued between him and Amadis. Englished by L. P. London:
  Printed for C. Burbie, and are to be sold at his shop at the Royal
  Exchange, 1595."

The Epistle Dedicatory to "Master Walter Borough" is signed "Lazarus

seen it assigned to some known writer of the time. As I do not find this

would kindly give me some information respecting its rarity, &c.

47. "_Non quid responderent_," _&c._--In the Life of Bishop Jewel
prefixed to the edition of his works, 1611, [para]24., there occurs a
sentence attributed to _Cicero in Verrem 3._:

  "Like Verres in Tully, _Non quid responderent, sed quemadmodum non
  responderent laborabant_."

But are the words to be found in _Cicero_ at all? They give no bad

49. _Queen Brun[/e]haut._--I read in a French book of travels that the
abbey of Saint Martin's, at Autun, contained the tomb of Queen
Brun[/e]haut, upon which was engraved the following inscription:

      "Ci-g[^i]t la Reine Brun[/e]haut,
      A qui le Saint Pape Gregoire
      Donna des [/e]loges de gloire,
      Qui mettent sa vertu bien haut.
      Sa pi[/e]t[/e] pour les saints myst[\e]res
      Lui fit fonder trois monast[\e]res,
      Sous la r[\e]gle de Saint Beno[^i]t:
      Saint Martin, Saint Jean, Saint Andoche,
      Sont trois saints lieux o[\u] l'on conno[^i]t
      Qu'elle est exempte de reproche."

1. Who was the Saint Gregory mentioned in this inscription? I believe
there can be little doubt that it was Pope Gregory I., commonly known as
Gregory the Great, and the cotemporary of Queen Brun[/e]haut. The only
other Pope of that name, that has been canonized, is Gregory VII., the
famous Hildebrand; but as his canonization did not take place till the
close of the last century (700 years after his death), an inscription,
which, from its obsolete rhymes of "Beno[^i]t" and "conno[^i]t," bears
internal evidence of having been made in the sixteenth or seventeenth
century, could not have applied to him the epithet _Saint_.

2. Brun[/e]haut having been one of the most profligate queens that ever sat
upon a throne, and Gregory the Great one of the most virtuous Popes that
have shed lustre on the tiara, a second Query presents itself:--Is it
possible that such a Pope could have degraded himself and his office by
eulogising such a queen? The bare idea is at variance with the known
character of that Pope; and the imputation, if substantiated, would
materially detract from his established reputation for piety and wisdom.

3. Is there any passage in the writings of Gregory the Great that can be
cited in support of the allegations of this inscription?

50. _Sculptured Stones in the North of Scotland._--Some time ago Patrick
Chalmers, Esq., of Auldbar, in the county of Forfar, obtained drawings
of all the sculptured stone obelisks in Angus, and got them lithographed
for the members of the Bannatyne Club. The work has excited considerable
attention among historical students in this country as well as abroad,
and certainly has laid a foundation for correct comparison of these with
other similar remains of a symbolical nature in other parts of the
country. In Aberdeenshire there is a considerable number of these
obelisks, which, either from the more primitive state of the people, or
the hardness of the granite, are much less elaborate than those in
Angus. None, however, can exceed the obelisks in Easter Ross for beauty
of execution. It is singular that no monument of this class has been
found south of the Forth. The Spalding Club (Aberdeen) proposes to
obtain drawings of all the stones of this description in the North of
Scotland; and the artist who depicted the Angus stones so accurately and
well for Mr. Chalmers has commenced his labours. Circulars have been
sent to the clergy of about 240 parishes in the North, asking for
information as to the locality of any sculptured stones in their
districts, but as yet answers have been obtained from only about 150. It
is probable that where no return has been made, there is no stone of the
description alluded to; but it would be desirable to know that the
Spalding Club had exhausted the matter.

51. _Prophecies of Nostradamus._--In a little work I am meditating on
the subject of English Popular Prophecies, I shall have occasion to
introduce a notice of this celebrated astrologer, whose successful
prediction of the Great Rebellion, and consequent English popularity,
almost entitle him to a place among our native vaticinating worthies.

The curious prefiguration of the fate of Charles I. stands thus in the
original edition of the _Prophesies_: Lyons, 1572, under the head, "A
mes Imprimeurs de Hongrie:"

      "Senat de Londres mettront [\a] mal leur Roy."

In the only other edition to which I have the opportunity of referring,
London, 1672, "Translated and commented upon by Theophilus de
Garencieres," it is much amplified:

      "XLIX.

      "Gand et Bruxelles marcheront contra Anvers.
      Senat de Londres mettront _[\a] mort_ leur Roy.
      Le sel et vin luy seront [\a] l'envers
      Pour eux avoir le Regne or desseroy."

The more literal accuracy of this version, and the number of the
quatrain (interpreted by the commentator to refer to the year of
Charles's death), induce doubts as to its authenticity. Collections of
early editions of Nostradamus are not of frequent occurrence in England:
but I am told that a fine series exists in the "Biblioth[\e]que du Roi,"
and as the subject is interesting, some one, perhaps, out of the many
readers of "NOTES AND QUERIES" who will visit Paris this holiday time
may be induced to examine them, and make a note of the _earliest_
edition in which the latter form of the prediction occurs.

52. _Quaker Expurgated Bible._--In an extremely curious and interesting
volume entitled _Quakerism, or the Story of my Life_, I meet with the
following passage, p. 386.:

  "About four years ago, an English Friend waited on me, to request
  me to enter my name as a subscriber to an edition of the Bible,
  which a Committee of Friends were intending to publish. The
  printed prospectus stated that the work was designed to be one
  suited for daily perusal in Friends' families; that from it would
  be carefully excluded every passage that was indelicate, and unfit
  for reading aloud; and also those portions which might be called
  dangerous, which it was possible the unlearned and unstable might
  wrest to their own destruction."

Can any of your readers tell whether this expurgated Bible was ever
published, and where it is to be procured?

A copy of the prospectus alluded to would also be very acceptable.

53. _Salmon Fishery in the Thames._--This was once of great importance
to the inhabitants of the villages upon the banks of the Thames, who
appear to have had each their assigned bounds for their fishery. In the
Churchwardens' Book of Wandsworth, under date 1580, is the following
entry:

  "M.D. that this yere in so[=m]er the fishinge Rome of Wandesworthe
  was by certen of Putney denyed, and long sute before my L. Mayor
  of London continued, and at the last, accordinge to Right,
  restored by the Lord Mayor and the Councell of London. And in this
  so[=m]er the fysshers of Wandesworthe tooke betweene Monday and
  Saturday seven score salmons in the same fishinge, to the gret
  honor of God."

I have heard my mother say, that Thames salmon was plentiful when she
was a younger woman, and that it was the most esteemed of any. She died
recently, aged eighty-nine.

Minor Queries Answered.

_The Twentieth of the Thirty-nine Articles._--In a note to a work
entitled _Sketches of the History of Man_, Dublin, 1779, at vol. i. p.
104. I observe the following statement:

  "In the Act 13th of Elizabeth, anno 1571, confirming the
  Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, these Articles are
  not engrossed, but referred to as comprised in a printed book,
  intitled 'Articles agreed to by the whole Clergy in Convocation
  holden at London, 1562.' The forged clause is, 'The Church has
  power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and authority in
  Controversies of Faith.' That clause is not in the Articles
  referred to; nor the slightest hint of any authority with respect
  to matters of faith. In the same year, 1571, the Articles were
  printed both in Latin and English, precisely as in the year 1562.
  But soon after came out spurious editions, in which the said
  clause was foisted into the Twentieth Article, and continues so to
  this day," &c.

This is a grave charge. Is it a true one? I have not at hand the
authorities by which to examine it, and therefore seek an answer from
some of your readers who may be able to give it. My question refers to
the imputation of a clause having been foisted into our Articles of
Faith by a forgery, and still continuing in them; not to the truth of
any part of our Articles as they now stand. To this there is sufficient
testimony.

  London, July 25. 1851.

  [The following note from p. 131. of Mr. Hardwick's recently
  published _History of the Articles_ will furnish a reply to this
  Query:--

  "He (Laud) was accused of forging the contested clause in Art. XX.
  And after appealing to four printed copies of the Articles, one of
  them as early as 1563, and all containing the passage which the
  Puritans disliked, he added, 'I shall make it yet plainer: for it
  is not fit concerning an Article of Religion, and an Article of
  such consequence for the order, truth, and peace of the Church,
  you should rely upon my copies, be they never so many or never so
  ancient. Therefore I sent _to the public records in my office, and
  here under my officer's hand, who is public notary, is returned to
  me the Twentieth Article with this affirmative clause in it, and
  there is also the whole body of the Articles to be
  seen.'_--_Remains_, ii. 83. (quoted by Bennet, 166.) The copy thus
  taken before the destruction of the records is said to be still
  extant; Bennet made use of it, and has printed it in his _Essay_,

_Exons of the Guard._--Can any of your readers inform me what are the
duties of these officers, and the derivation of their title? I find, in
the papers describing her Majesty's state ball, the following: "the
exons or capitaines exempts _de la garde du corps;_" but that does not
throw much light upon the subject.

  [The name of _Exempts_ or _Exons_ is manifestly borrowed from that
  of the officers in the old French _Garde du Corps_, who were
  styled in their commissions _Capitaines Exempts des Gardes du
  Corps_. Richelet describes the _Exempt_ as the officer who
  commanded in the absence of the Lieutenant or Ensign, and who had
  charge of the night watch. In both cases, the duties of the
  English and French officers are completely parallel.]

_Curious Monumental Inscription: "Quos Anguis tristi."_--Have any of
your readers seen Latin verses constructed in the following curious
manner? I copied these many years ago from an old magazine:--

      "Qu      an      tris      di      c      vul      stra
         os      guis      ti      ro     um       nere      vit,

  "John Herenden, mercer, esquire, 1572; these verses on an old

_Meaning of "Deal."_--I shall feel greatly obliged to any of the readers
of your entertaining and instructive miscellany, if they can explain the
meaning of the word _deal_, as used in Exod. xxix. 40. A tenth of flour
is the verbal rendering of the Hebrew, the Septuagint, and the Vulgate.
It was introduced by Coverdale and Tyndale, and is, I believe, in all
our English translations except the Puritan or Genevan, which has "a
tenth part;" and Mr John Ray of Glasgow, in his revised translation, who
renders the word "the tenth of an ephah." Is this use of the word _deal_
noticed in any dictionary?

  [The word "_deal_" in the passage referred to by our correspondent
  clearly signifies "_part_," and corresponds with the German
  "_theil_." It is from the A-S.; and Chaucer uses the phrases
  "never a _del_" and "every _del_," for "never a bit" and "every
  bit." In the _Vision of Piers Ploughman_ we have a nearly parallel
  phrase to that used in our Bibles:

  "That hevedes of holy church ben That han hir wil here Withouten

_La Mer des Histoires._--Who is the author of _La Mer des Histoires_? I

be a translation from the Latin of _Rudimentum Noviciorum_, with the
addition of the French Chronicles, and made at the instance of Andr[/e] de
la Haye, Seigneur de Chaumot, Paymaster of Sens. It is printed at Paris
in the month of July, 1448, by Pierre le Rouge. In how many volumes is
the work comprised? Is it very scarce?

    R. C. H. H.

  [Greswell, in his _Annals of Parisian Typography_, p. 307., says,
  "The designation _La Mer des Histoires_ seems, as a popular one,
  to have been given to French chronicles of various descriptions.
  Two impressions thus entitled appeared Parisiis, post 1500, viz.,

PASSAGE IN VIRGIL.

(Vol. iv., p. 24.)

Your correspondent ERYX inquires, in your paper of July 12, whether
Servius's interpretation of

      "Viridesque secant placido aequore silvas."

      Virg. _AEn._ viii. 96.

be correct. I beg to reply that it is not. The interpretations of
Servius are almost invariably incorrect; Servius was a very illiterate,
ignorant, and narrow-minded man, and totally unable to understand the
author whom he attempted to illustrate. His comments on Virgil resemble
those which we might expect a hedge schoolmaster in Yorkshire now to
make upon Milton. These comments, which are only valuable on account of
the mythological traditions which are preserved in them, have been very
injurious to the right understanding of Virgil.

The meaning of the passage in question is, that the AEneadae row up the
river among the green woods, or (literally) "secant silvas," _travel the
woods_, "placido aequore," _on the calm surface of the water_, _i. e._ by
rowing up the placid stream of the river. This, and not that assigned by
Servius following Terentienus, is the true meaning. 1st. Because
_secare_ with the objective case means constantly in Virgil to _travel
along_. Compare "viam secat ad naves," _AEn._ vi. 902.; "secuit sub
nubibus arcum," v. 658., &c. 2ndly. Because the Tiber is described only
as _placid_, not as _clear_; and as appears from _AEn._ vii. 31., was
actually _very muddy_, "multa flavus arena." The immediately preceding
words, "variisque teguntur arboribus," have been pronounced by a very
learned critic (one who has often deserved well of Virgil) to be _idle,
otiosa_. (See Wagner ad _AEn._ i. 678.) And his opinion has been
sanctioned by the usually judicious Forbiger. But they are not idle; on
the contrary, they are necessary to convey the idea that the AEneadae
passed up the river _under the shade of the trees_; and so are
supplemental to the statement contained in the words cited by your
correspondent, which inform us only that they went up the river. Hence a
confirmation of the correctness of the received interpretation.

    JAMES HENRY.

  34. Westland Row, Dublin, July 14. 1851.

Your correspondent ERYX wishes to know, whether in the passage (_AEneid_,
viii. 96.)--

      "Viridesque secant placido aequore silvas,"

the word _secant_ can legitimately convey the same idea that is
expressed in Tennyson's lines--

            ---- "my shallop ... clove
      The citron shadows in the blue."

There can be little doubt that this well-known passage in the _AEneid_ is
the _original_ of Tennyson's image; that, in fact, it is an excusable
plagiarism on the part of the latter, who, in introducing, his image,
has, I think, missed the appropriateness, and therefore increased
beauty, belonging to it in the original passage of Virgil.

When AEneas is journeying up the Tiber to visit Evander, the river, in
order to lessen his labours--

      "refluens ... substitit unda;"

but notwithstanding this, the journey was arduous as is shown in the
_whole_ of the three lines 94-96.

      "Olli remigio noctemque diemque fatigant,
      Et longos superant flexes, variisque teguntur
      Arboribus, viridesque secant pacido aequore silvas."

That is to say, "They labour at the oar till night is wearied out, and
day also is obliged to give place in its turn; they master one by one
the long serpentine bends of the river, and, though covered and inclosed
by the varied foliage above them, they cut their way through the
opposing woods, which lie, as it were, in their path in the shadowy
surface of the clear, still water."

The word _placido_ is surely sufficient to prevent any one falling into
the common-place interpretation alluded to by your correspondent as the
one "usually given."

THE VINE OF ST. FRANCIS.

(Vol. iii., p. 502.)

I feel much obliged for the information afforded by your Dutch
correspondent. When I sent you my Query on the subject more than a year
ago, I wrote principally from memory; but as I have now the work in
question lying beside me as I write, and as it seems to be rarer and
less known than I had imagined, you will perhaps find place for a more
minute description of it.

_The Vine of St. Francis_ is a folio volume, containing 418 numbered
leaves, a "Prologhe" of one leaf (next to the title-page), and a "Tafel
v[=a] dit boeck" at the end, of five leaves and a half unnumbered.

The title-page contains a full-length picture of the saint, with a
nimbus round his head, the knotted cord round his waist, and his palms
extended, displaying the sacred stigmata. Above the picture is the title
in red and black. I have written in Italics the words printed in red:

  _historien_ legenden ende _duechdel[:y]cke_ leer[=e]nghen allen

And under the picture "Cum _gratia_ et _privilegio_." On the back of the
title-page is printed as follows:--

Under these tables of contents occur two stanzas, the first containing
five lines, the second containing seven lines. They commence:--

      "[P] O salige w[:y]ngaert seer diep gheplant
      Groyende in duechden van vruchten playsant," &c.

The preface to the _Grote Legende_ informs us that it is Saint
Bonaventura's life of Saint Francis, and mentions why it is called the
_Great Legend_. This life ends at folio 47.

The preface to the _Oude Legende_, which next follows, states that it is
"gathered from the writings of his companions and the chronicles of the
order of the Brothers Minor;" and the "Prologhe" (which succeeds the
preface) mentions--

  "Die leg[=e]de van z[:y]n drie gesellen den spiegel der
  volcom[=e]heyts der minderbroeders. Broeder Thomas oude legends
  e[=n] d[=e] boeck der ghel[:y]cheden daer seer schoon besereu[=e] is.
  Hoe ghel[:y]ck dat dese heylighe man Franciscus: Christo Jhesu."

These lives, I suppose, are--that joint narrative compiled by three
intimate associates of the Saint, "z[:y]n drie gesellen," that composed by
Thomas of Celano; and the _Liber Conformitatum_.

The 39th chap. of this _Oude Legende_, folio ciii., relates, as the
preface says--

  "[P] Hoe dat S. F. woude reysen in verre l[=a]den om dat vole te
  bekeren e[=n] te vermaenen e[=n] v[=a] die grote tribulacie die hi
  leet int solda[=e]s lant e[=n] hoe hi gerne martelaer hadde
  geworden e[=n] hoe die broeders te Antiochien s[:y]n oord[=e]
  a[=e]naemen."

On which Jewish-converting martyrdom-seeking journey Dr. Geddes (in his
curious little work on the _Romish Orders of Monks and Friars_, Lond.
1714) quaintly remarks:

  "A Quaker's having gone from England to Rome to convert the pope
  to his religion, is a mighty jest with some people, who are very
  much edified with this story of Francis's going from Italy to
  Egypt to convert the sultan, but these two adventures do to me
  appear to be so much alike that I shall leave it to anatomists to
  tell whether good wits that prompt others, have not their brains
  either made of the same size, or much in the same posture."

The _Oude Legende_ ends folio 44. Next follows:

  "[P] Die historie van d[=e] aflaet van Sinte Maria van d[=e]
  enghelen diem[=e] porti[=u]kel heet,"

as the preface hath it. Some of your readers may have seen an
advertisement respecting a series of Franciscan works (to be published,
I think, by Richardson of Derby), entitled the _Portioncule Library_;
and seeing in the above table of contents "Die aflaet van Portiunkel,"
or the Indulgence of the _Portiunkel_, they may be at a loss to know its
meaning, so I shall quote a note from Mrs. Jameson's highly interesting
and valuable work on the _Monastic Orders_, which is to the purpose:

  "The term Porzioncula means literally 'a small portion, share, or
  allotment.' The name was given to a slip of land, of a few acres
  in extent, at the foot of the hill of Assisi, and on which stood a
  little chapel; both belonged to a community of Benedictines, who
  afterwards bestowed the land and the chapel on the brotherhood of
  S. Francis. This chapel was then familiarly known as the 'Capella
  della Porzioncula.' Whether the title by which it has since become
  famous as the S. Maria-degli-Angeli belonged to it originally, or
  because the angels were heard singing around and above it at the
  time of the birth of St. Francis, does not seem clear. At all
  events this chapel became early sanctified as the scene of the
  ecstasies and visions of the saint; here also S. Clara made her
  profession. Particular indulgences were granted to those who
  visited it for confession and repentance on the fifth of August
  and it became a celebrated place of pilgrimage in the fourteenth
  century. Mr. Ford tells us, that in Spain the term _Porzioncula_
  is applied generally to distinguish the chapel or sanctuary
  dedicated to St. Francis within the Franciscan churches. The
  original chapel of the Porzioncula now stands in the centre of the
  magnificent church which has been erected over it."

In the "Legende" of St. Anthony of Padua, chap. vii. fol. ccxx., we have
that saint's "sermo ad pisces" in the city of Rimini, _die vol ketters
was_, and the conversion therefrom of the said _ketters_ or heretics.

The "Prologhe" to the narrative "van die v[:y]f Martelaren," fol.
clxxviii., commences, "Ego quasi Vitis fructificavi suavitatem odoris
alo cen[=e] w[:y]ngaert," &c.: here we learn why the work is called _Den
W[:y]ngaert_, or _The Vine_.

In the "tractat v[=a] S. F. orden e[=n] reghele," at fol. cccxxix., we
have an account of Brother Agnellus of Pisa his mission to England in
1224.

In the "Getal der broeder[=e] e[=n] prouintien," at fol. cccci., we
learn that at that time (1518) England had 7 convents and 200 friars;
Ireland 15 convents and 400 friars; and Scotland 8 convents and 120
friars.

The "Kalendier" which follows this "Getal" is printed in red and black.

"Den aflaet v[=a] rom[=e]" is the last tract in the book. Here is the
finis:

  "[P] Hier eyndt b[:y] de gratie gods dat derde boec v[=a] desen
  w[:y]ngaert die mit groten arbeyt wt veel duct[=e]tel[:y]cke scrift[=e]

  allen gueden kenten menschen.

  "[P] Hier na volcht di tafele."

After the "tafel" or index occur some verses containing seventy-three
lines, eulogistic of the saint.

I forgot to mention that in the _Oude Legende_ some of St. Francis's
poems are given, translated from the Italian originals: at fol. cxxii.
is given the "Canticum solis," part of which Sir James Stephen quotes in
his sketch of the saint's life.

I have Query to make, but must defer it to another time, as I have
already taken up enough of your paper.

(Vol. ii., p. 464.).--

"FIAT JUSTITIA, RUAT COELUM"

(Vol. ii., p. 494.).

An extraordinary mode of swearing, akin to the oaths already noticed,
is recorded by Ysbrant Ides in his _Travels from Moscow to China_
(London, 1705, and reprinted in the second volume of Harris's
Collection):--

  "Two Tunguzian hostages falling out, one accused the other before
  the Waywode (or Viceroy) of having conjured his deceased brother
  to death. The Waywode asked the accuser if he would, according to
  the Tunguzian custom, put the accused to his oath? To this he
  answered in the affirmative; after which the accused took a _live
  dog_, laid him on the ground, and with a knife stuck him into the
  body, just under his left foot, and immediately clapped his mouth
  to the wound, and sucked out the dog's blood as long as he could
  come at it; after which he lift him up, laid him on his shoulders,
  and clapped his mouth again to the wound in order to suck out the
  remaining blood. An excellent drink indeed! And this is the
  greatest oath and most solemn confirmation of the Truth amongst
  them; so that on credit of this the accused was set free, and the
  accuser punished for his false accusation."

The dog, designed, as Cicero observes, for man's use, was doubtless
selected for his sagacity and faithfulness; and by Loccenius, in his
_Leges W. Gothicae_, "tria canum capita" are stated to have been
"Hunnorum gentis insignia," the progenitors of the Tunguzians, p. 107.
In Northern Europe "sanguine Deos placari creditum; canibus etiam cum
hominibus permist[\e] in luco suspensis." (_Ibid._ p. 105.)

Among the northern nations, not only their testimoniary oaths were thus
sanctioned by blood, but their confederative also, in which their
fraternisation was symbolised by reciprocal transfusion of blood.

      "Dear as the blood that warms my heart."

      Gray's _Bard_.

It was the custom of the Scythians "non dextras tantum implicare, sed
pollices mutuo vincire, nodoque perstringere; mox sanguine in artus
extremos se effundente levi ritu _cruorem elicere_, atque invicem
lambere." (Hanseanius _De Jurejurando Verterum_.) Quintus Curtius
remarks that among the Hindoos (between whom and the Scythians Sir W.
Jones and other ethnographers have observed various traces of affinity)
the joining of right hands was their usual mode of salutation; "dextra
fidei sedes."

En passant, I have elsewhere seen the opinion quoted by a correspondent
(Vol. ii., p. 464), "Sedem animae in digitis ponunt," attributed to the
Hindoos. Query, Has not the profession of [Greek: thel[^e]tai] (see Dr.
Maitland on _Mesmerism_) prevailed among them? Their propensity to
conjuring is so proverbial, that, according to a writer in the _Asiatic
Researches_, that term is derived from one of their tribes. See also on
their witchcrafts, Acosta's _East and West Indies_, chap. xxvi.

Before I dismiss the subject of swearing, permit me to observe what
appears to me to be the origin of the apothegm "Fiat Justitia, ruat
Coelum" (Vol. ii., p. 494.), which, with a slight change, was afterwards
adopted by Ferdinand, emperor of Austria.

May it not have originated in an oath similar to that of Chaganus, king
of the Huns, recorded by Otrokoesi, in his _Historiae Hungaricae_?--

  "Abarico ritu jusjurandum ad hunc modum praestitit. Ense edueto et
  in altum sublato sibi et Abaricorum genti dira imprecatus _si quid
  mali_, &c. _Coelum_ ex alto ipsis et Deus Ignis qui in coelo est,
  _irrueret_."

More sententiously he may have said: "Fiat [a me] justitia, [in me] ruat
Coelum, [si non]."

works referred to in Vol. iii., p. 192., see _Gentleman's Magazine_,
vol. i. p. 415.; on the singular notion, in the fourteenth century, of
the harmlessness of colloquial and affirmative oaths, see _Archaeologia_,
vol. xx. p. 43.; and on the opposition made by the Lollards to this
unchristian practice, Purvey's _Remonstrance against the Corruptions of

HUGH HOLLAND AND HIS WORKS.

(Vol. iii. p. 427.; Vol. iv., p. 62.)

The querist on Hugh Holland and his works, must be content with a reply
of unvarnished brevity.

1. "Where are these lines taken from, and what do they mean?"--The lines
are from the _Cypress garland_ of Hugh Holland, 1625. 4to. The meaning
is obvious. I assume that Holland may be trusted as to his own age, to
which Wood gives no clue.

2. "Who says he did not quit Westminster school till 1589?"--Wood says
he was bred in Westminster school, and "elected into Trinity coll. in
Cambridge, an. 1589." Welch, from official documents, gives the same
date. Wood nowhere states that he "matriculated at Baliol in 1582."

3. "My words are, '_about_ 1590 he succeeded to a fellowship.'"--Wood
says he was elected to Trinity college in 1589, "of which he was
_afterwards_ fellow." It may have been some years afterwards.

4. "Why does not MR. CORNEY give your readers his interpretation of the
mysterious H. H.?"--He reserved it for another occasion, but now
consents to satisfy the curiosity of the querist and others.

In 1632 Henry Holland dedicated to Charles I. an English version of the
_Cyrvpaedia_ of Xenophon, made by his father Philemon Holland. In the
dedication, which is signed at length, he says:

  "Also, when any unworthy selfe (anno 1620) offred mine owne
  collections, entituled _Herwologia Anglica_, unto his highnesse
  [James I.], he most graciously received it."

In 1614 appeared, under the initials "H. H.," the _Monvmenta
sepvlchraria sancti Pavli_, and in the address _ad lectorem_ we read:

  "Et non sol[\u]m nomine bonus appellatus est [sc. Alex. Nowel], sed
  etiam et in vita sua bonitas apparuit, et in morte bona sua opera
  illum sunt sequuta, et uberi[\u]s et fusi[\u]s in _Effigiebus_ nostris
  et _vitis illustrium Anglorum_ cum de Coleto tum de illo apparet:
  (quae nunc transmarino habitu vestiendae sunt) quare hic illum
  pluribus prosequi verbis non est opus."

Here is unanswerable evidence that Henry Holland was the compiler of
both works. In the catalogue of the Grenville collection of books, now
in the British Museum, both works are ascribed to Hugh Holland.

5. "The edition of 1614 was certainly the first, and that of 1633
_certainly_ the second."--The querist adopts my correction of his
threefold error, and calls it an _answer_!

6. "I shall therefore leave the shade of Cole and MR. BOLTON CORNEY to
settle the question as to whether any such work exists."--The querist
did not perceive that the _Roxana of Alexander_ was an error for the
_Roxana of Alabaster_--so he endeavours to draw off the attention of his
readers from this proof of critical obtuseness by a common-place
witticism.

I must describe the facile process by which our querist has obtained his
apparent triumph. Wood, at the close of his article on Hugh Holland the
poet, which is chiefly derived from the _Worthies_ of Fuller, mentions
one Hugh Holland as admitted B.A. in 1570, and another Hugh Holland as
matriculated at Baliol college in 1582, aged twenty-four; with others of
that surname. He adds, "but whether any of them were authors, I cannot
yet tell, or _whether the last was the same with the poet_. Qu." Now,
with regard to the first and second articles, our querist omits the
sentence which proves the inapplicability of his quotations! and with
regard to the third article, he omits the word _afterwards_, which forms
the gist of the argument.

LADY FLORA HASTINGS' BEQUEST.

(Vol. iv., p. 44.)

"Assertion is not proof," and it surely does require _proof_ ere we
consent to brand a writer of unimpeached character with the charge of "a
shameless, heartless act of literary piracy."

It rests with ERZA to bring forward his or her _proof_ that the lines in
dispute were written by Lady Flora. ERZA asserted that they were "never
before printed." I have enabled him or her to satisfy himself or herself
that they were in print _nearly_ twelve years ago. I am disposed to
believe ERZA equally mistaken in the assertion as to the authorship of
the lines. If this prove so, the imputation cast upon Miss Barber will
revert upon her accuser, and will demand the most ample apology.

I do not know Miss Barber; her writings I have long admired; and having
been the means of drawing down upon her such an accusation, I am not
disposed to let the inquiry terminate here. Nor can I believe the Editor
of "NOTES AND QUERIES" will desire that either a literary error or a
groundless slander should descend to posterity in his pages.

    L. H. K.

ERZA cannot entertain a higher respect than I do for the memory of Lady
Flora Hastings; but I am sure no member of her family would countenance
any attempt to exalt her reputation at the expense of another's; and I
fear ERZA, however unintentionally, has fallen into this error. The
stanzas she attributed to Lady Flora, as L. H. K. stated (Vol. iii., p.
522.), were published as Miss M. A. S. Barber's in _The Christian Lady's
Magazine_ for September, 1839, only two months after Lady Flora's death.
In the preceding number, as L. H. K. also correctly stated, is a brief
memoir of Lady Flora, in which it is said, that shortly before her death
she "delivered to her fond brother a little Bible, the gift of her
mother, requesting him to restore it to that beloved parent," &c. ERZA
may be unacquainted with that publication, but I can assure her that
Lady Flora's brother, my esteemed and lamented patron, was not; for
shortly after the number appeared, I found it lying on his table, in his
own private room at Donington Park, and, while waiting to see him,
partly read it there myself for the first time. I know not whether he
ever read the lines in question in the succeeding number, but I know the
_Magazine_ was regularly taken by some of Lady Flora's intimate friends,
and I cannot suppose they would allow any poem of hers to pass unnoticed
for twelve years, with the signature of Miss Barber attached to it.
Indeed the stanzas bear internal evidence of being written after Lady
Flora's death, and founded on the account given by _Charlotte Elizabeth_
in the preceding number. If, however, ERZA still persists in attributing
them to Lady Flora Hastings, she is in duty bound to give her authority,
and not bring such a heavy accusation against Miss Barber on the bare
assertion of an anonymous correspondent. If Miss Barber really composed
the stanzas, as I believe she did, she was doubtless actuated with a
desire to honour the memory and character of Lady Flora; and in such
case nothing could be more cruel and unjust than the conduct imputed to
her by ERZA. Unfortunately I do not know Miss Barber's address, or
whether she is still living; but if any of your readers do, I hope they
will name this case to her, or her friends, that her reputation may be
cleared from the imputation thus rashly cast on it. If the case cannot
thus be satisfactorily settled, I will obtain the desired information
from another quarter; but I hope ERZA will also offer the assistance in
her power towards this desirable object; and to set the example of
candour and openness, I will subscribe my real name.

Replies to Minor Queries.

_Coke and Cowper_ (Vol. iv., p. 24.).--In reply to one of your
correspondents, who inquires as to the correct pronunciation of the name
of the poet _Cowper_, I may mention, that some years ago, being on a
visit in the neighbourhood of Weston Underwood, I made particular
inquiries on this point in the village, and found that _there_ the poet
had always been known as Mr. C_oo_per. The name of the noble family to
which he was related will be the best criterion.

By the way, was there not sometime since a proposal for erecting by
subscription a worthy monument to a poet whose memory every Christian
must revere? In whose hands was this project, and with whom does its
execution rest?

    THOS. MCCALMONT.

  Highfield, near Southampton, July 22. 1851.

In my humble opinion, Coke is the old English form of writing _cook_,
from A.-Sax. "c[/o]c." See Chaucer's _Coke's Tale_, and _Cock Lorrell's
Bote_, where we read "Drouers, Cokes, and pulters;" and in this same
poem occurs the line, "Carpenters, _coupers_, and ioyners." See also
under Cooper in Pegge's _Anecdotes of the English Language_; the names,
as thus pronounced, are rendered significant.

Should it be asked how we ought to pronounce the name of another poet,
viz. Cowley, if Cowper be called Cooper, I answer that they are from
different roots: that Cowley is from _cow_, and _ley_, signifying cow
pasture, or place for cows; and that Cowper is only another form of
Cooper: not but that in the north they pronounce _cow_ as _coo_, and,
therefore, they would call him Cooley.

  year 1664, when _The Rival Ladies_, which was Dryden's second

Letitia (Mrs. Aubrey), if she had any?" William Penn (the son) married

_Miss or Mistress_ (Vol. iv., p. 6.).--The indiscriminate use of "Miss"
and "Mrs." to unmarried ladies is often very perplexing. The "Mrs." was
not, as M. S. supposes, always accompanied by the Christian name for
unmarried ladies; and the custom lasted at least as late as the reign of
George II. Pope in his letters (about 1719) mentions "Mrs. Lepel" and
"Mrs. Bellenden," maids of honour. The examples are innumerable, but the
_latest_ instance I remember is the Duchess of Queensbury addressing
Patty Blount in 1756 as "Mrs. Blount;" though, no doubt, Patty was, by
_that time_, entitled to what is called _brevet_ rank.

    C.

_Book Plates_ (Vol. iii., p. 495.; Vol. iv., p. 46.).--MR. PARSONS, I
observe, confines his inquiry to English book plates. On that point I
cannot at present offer him any information but I can to a certain
extent confirm his views with regard to the use of them in foreign
countries, having now before me the plate (a woodcut) of Erhardus [\a]
Muckhenthall--probably in modern German, Erhardt von Muckenthal--dated
1634. It consists of his armorial bearings, surmounted by a helmet, &c.,
apparently indicative of nobility; but the tinctures not being
expressed, I cannot give the blazon. The charge on his shield seems to
be intended for a lamb salient.

Mr. Macaulay's vigorous sketch of the gallant cornet of horse who
resigned his commission for the toga, and, after figuring during his
life as statesman than whom "none has left a more stainless, and none a
more splendid name," was stricken down in full council while straining
his feeble voice to rouse the drooping spirit of his country, forms the
fifth part of _The Traveller's Library_: and it would be difficult to
find a volume of the same compass better calculated to furnish a couple
of hours' amusing and instructive reading than _William Pitt, Earl of

Actresses, and Dramatic Writers, but including a very interesting series
of letters, documents, and papers relating to the Byron family, and,
what is of still more importance and historical value, the Autograph
Correspondence of Charles I. with Captain Titus, written during his
imprisonment in Carisbrook Castle, and treating of his proposed escape
from it, and also some letters of Charles II., addressed by him, after
the Restoration, to the same zealous adherent. On the following day
Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson will be employed in the disposal of a very
select Collection of Autograph Letters and Historical Documents,
including Letters and Autographs of Queen Elizabeth, James I., King John

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
