Preliminary Survey of a Paleocene Faunule
from the Angels Peak Area, New Mexico

INTRODUCTION

Angels Peak stands on the eastern rim of a large area of badlands
carved by a tributary of the San Juan River from Paleocene strata of
the Nacimiento formation, and presumably also from Wasatchian strata of
the San Jose (Simpson, 1948). This area of badlands lies some twelve
miles south of Bloomfield, New Mexico in the Kutz Canyon drainage.
Angels Peak (Angel Peak of Granger, 1917) and Kutz Canyon (Coots Canon
of Granger, and of Matthew, 1937) are names that have been applied to
the location (figure 1).

Mexico, showing location of University of Kansas fossil locality west
of Angels Peak.]

E. D. Cope's collector, David Baldwin, possibly worked in this area in
the Eighties. The first published record, however, of mammalian fossils
from the Angels Peak badlands was made by Walter Granger in 1917 as a
result of his field work in the preceding summer. Granger obtained
specimens, usually poorly preserved, but occasionally rather abundant
locally, from various levels up to within 150 feet of the western rim
of the badlands basin. This collection was obviously of Torrejonian or
middle Paleocene age. In the 1917 report, Granger gave as a faunal list
the following species:

_Tetraclaenodon_
_Mioclaenus turgidus_
_Periptychus rhabdodon_
_Anisonchus sectorius_
_Protogonodon sp. nov._
_Tricentes_
_Deltatherium_
_Psittacotherium_

To this list should be added _Triisodon antiquus_, a specimen of which
is stated by Matthew to come from Kutz Canyon in his monograph
(1937:80) on the Paleocene faunas of the San Juan Basin.

In the summer of 1948, a field party from the University of Kansas was
fortunate in finding a local concentration of rather well preserved
material at the western edge of the badlands at Angels Peak. Because it
probably will be some time before a full account of this faunule can be
prepared, it is thought advisable, preliminarily, to give a general
statement as to occurrence, and tentatively to list the species.


OCCURRENCE

The mammalian fossils, numbering approximately 150 specimens, were all
obtained within a small area located in the NW 1/4 of sec. 14, T. 27 N,
R. 11 W, San Juan County, New Mexico. The specimens were collected from
a zone of reddish silt three to four feet in thickness. The actual bone
layer, not as yet located, may prove to be thinner than this. Almost
all the material was recovered from approximately 100 linear yards of
outcrop. A few specimens, however, were obtained at varying distances
away from this central area, as far distant perhaps as one-half mile.
Of these, nineteen were at the same level stratigraphically, and only
one was lower (by 70 feet) in the section. This latter specimen,
representing a new genus and species of Primates, is not certainly
duplicated by material at the main concentration. Seemingly, the others
are.

       *       *       *       *       *

The red zone at the "bone pocket" carries many concretionary masses
which frequently contain the fossil specimens. Not all specimens,
however, are from such lumps.

Even within the area of greatest concentration, specimens are of
sporadic occurrence. A low ridge, a few feet high, may have abundant
material weathering from the rock on one slope, but have the opposite
side barren. Occasionally, a small rill three or four feet in length
and six inches or so across may carry fragments of five or six
individuals representing several genera. For example, in one such rill
were found _Didymictis_, n. sp. b; _Goniacodon levisanus_; _Tricentes
cf. T. subtrigonus_; and _Protoselene opisthacus_. No specimens were
found in place in unweathered rock, but the quarry possibilities of the
bone pocket have still to be tested.

The stratigraphic position of the bone concentration in relation to
the total Nacimiento section exposed in Kutz Canyon has not been
determined. It is approximately 160 feet below the western rim at a
point nearest the "pocket". The upper 100 feet of strata consists of
sandstone believed by Granger (1917:822) to represent either: (1)
equivalent of the "Wasatch" (San Jose) of the Ojo Alamo section, or
(2) "Torrejon" (upper Nacimiento). Granger perhaps favored the first
interpretation, but the writer, at present, thinks the second
probable.

ANGELS PEAK CENSUS

The total number of specimens for each member (species or genus) of
the faunule is tabulated in the list on the page facing, page 7. For
the purposes of this list, census, a few of the isolated teeth have
been counted as jaws. They were so counted whenever they seemed to be
representative of separate, individual animals.

The census-count includes all of the specimens that were identified.
The numbers in parentheses, on page 7, refer to those individuals that
were found outside of the 100 linear yards or so of outcrop comprising
the principal area of concentration of specimens.

ENVIRONMENT

The faunal list is rather long for one obtained from such a restricted
area. It is not exceptional in this regard, however, for even longer
lists have been made from single quarry sites in the Paleocene
(Simpson, 1937:33-34). The exact number of genera and species
represented is still uncertain. It seems that twenty-one genera and
twenty-four species are present and that they are distributed among
eleven to twelve families and five to six orders. A greater number of
genera and species may be recorded eventually.

The ferungulate cohort constitutes most of the fauna (91 percent),
and this fact indicates a floodplain facies as the most probable
depositional environment. The small representation of multituberculates,
insectivores, and insectivore derivatives, however, may be attributed
in part to the difficulties inherent in surface collecting of minute
specimens.

Some resemblance in percentage composition is shown to the faunules of
the Fort Union Group if those forms too small to be seen readily in
collecting of surface material are omitted from the Montanan lists, but
differences exist not entirely the result of either geographic or
stratigraphic separation. Thus, the phenacodontids of the Angels Peak
are relatively abundant, matching figures obtained for surface
collecting in the Fort Union of Montana (Simpson, 1937:61).

That the faunule is not completely of floodplain type is seen in the
absence or rarity of such relatively large carnivores as _Claenodon
ferox_, the larger species of _Chriacus_, _Triisodon_, and the entire
absence of the Mesonychidae. The absence of the mesonychids might, but
probably should not, be explained as a result of stratigraphic
differences. There seems to be no reason for thinking that the Angels
Peak faunule antedates the appearance of the Mesonychidae. They are
absent from the Dragon and earlier levels, but are also extremely rare
in the Lebo of the Fort Union Group. In the ungulate population, the
absence of species of _Ellipsodon_ other than _E. acolytus_ (_E.
inaequidens_ is so rare everywhere that it hardly seems an exception to
this statement), and the complete absence of _Haploconus_ likewise
suggest some, presumably local, peculiarity of environment. The latter
genus is absent from the Lebo, but is recorded from the Dragon (Gazin,
1941:3), a fact which prevents attaching any age significance to its
absence from the Angels Peak faunule. It should be mentioned, however,
that no remains of _Haploconus_ were reported as a result of the more
extensive collecting by Granger in the Angels Peak area. Incidentally,
the type of _Haploconus angustus_ is said to come from near Huerfano
Peak (Matthew, 1937:156).

The high ratio of carnivores to ungulates is a peculiarity shared with,
but far exceeded by, the Lebo fauna if figures obtained from surface
collections of the latter are used. It seems unlikely that this ratio
is the result of selective trapping in the accumulating sediments.
Perhaps, this high ratio reflects the imperfectly carnivorous habits of
the Paleocene creodonts as a group. One obvious explanation, regardless
of probability or merit, is that some of these do not belong to the
Carnivora.

The percentage composition of the Angels Peak faunule based on 148
identifiable mammalian specimens, is as follows:

                             Percent
Insectivora:                    5
Carnivora:
  Arctocyonidae:           32
  Miacidae:                 4
                          ---  36
Condylarthra:
  Hyopsodontidae:          22
  Phenacodontidae:         18
  Periptychidae:
    Anisonchinae:      10
    Periptychinae:      5
                      ---  15
                          ---  55

Others:                         4
                             ----
                              100

The most common forms in the Angels Peak faunule are: _Tricentes_ cf.
_T. subtrigonus_, _Chriacus truncatus_, _Ellipsodon acolytus_,
_Tetraclaenodon_ nr. _T. puercensis_, and _Anisonchus sectorius_.

Post-cranial skeletal elements are of relatively rare occurrence in the
pocket. The presence of several more or less complete skulls, and the
relatively frequent association of upper and lower dentitions, however,
seem to be points against ascribing the accumulation to the activities
of predators and scavengers, otherwise perhaps indicated by the large
amount of resistant tooth material.


AGE OF THE FAUNULE

The Angels Peak faunule, as Granger stated, is of Torrejonian age. This
fact is clearly evident for the genera are all, with the exception of
the forms referred to the Primates, represented in beds of that age
elsewhere in the Nacimiento. Further, approximately two-thirds of the
known "Torrejon" genera are recorded by specimens from the Angels Peak
pocket. The primate remains present no evidence for suspecting a
difference in age, because the order is otherwise unrecorded in the
Torrejonian of New Mexico. The species are in most instances identical
or closely allied with those hitherto recognized. It is evident from
this that the Angels Peak faunule is more closely correlated in time
with the San Juan Torrejonian fauna as a whole than with either the
Dragon fauna or the Tiffanian. In respect to the San Juan Torrejonian,
closest resemblance is to the _Deltatherium_ zone fauna rather than to
the _Pantolambda_ zone fauna (Osborn, 1929:62). The difference in the
faunas of these two zones is largely, if not entirely, facial in
character.

It is not clearly evident, however, that we are dealing with exactly
contemporaneous assemblages when comparison is made between the Angels
Peak faunule and the rest of the San Juan fauna which serves
collectively to define the typical Torrejonian. It may be: (1) that the
Angels Peak faunule is of slightly different age than the latter, or
(2) that the latter is susceptible of stratigraphic subdivision, and
the Angels Peak faunule marks one stage of a sequence in time. This
problem will not be easily solved, and perhaps may never be, for
concentrations similar to that of the Angels Peak faunule are of
infrequent occurrence. It is beyond the scope of the present paper, and
of the present stage of our knowledge of the "Torrejon" fauna, to
discuss at length the possible difference in age, but the following
remarks summarize the matter for the Angels Peak material.

Many of the Angels Peak specimens differ in minor ways from those
previously described from the Torrejonian of the San Juan Basin. Some
of these differences are sufficiently great for the recognition of new
species. Other differences at present are not clearly valid on a
specific level, and it may become necessary to restudy the entire fauna
if satisfactory conclusions ever are reached.

A direct comparison can be made between the Angels Peak faunule, and a
numerically smaller and less well preserved one obtained by the
University of Kansas from a bone concentration near the head of
Kimbetoh Arroyo. The latter faunule presumably is from the
"_Deltatherium_ zone," and hence does not occupy a demonstrably high
position in the "Torrejon," rather, one seemingly down toward the first
known appearance of the fauna. Closely related or identical species of
nine genera occur at both localities. Of these, the specimens of one
species seem to be indistinguishable; the specimens of another Angels
Peak member are perhaps slightly more advanced; and seven include
specimens, distinguishable in greater or lesser degree, which suggest,
principally in smaller size, a less advanced stage for the Angels Peak
faunule.

In general, the non-ferungulate part of the Angels Peak faunule seems
to depart more widely from what is typical of the "Torrejon" fauna than
do the Carnivora and Condylarthra. Because the former is very poorly
represented in the faunule, and not too well known elsewhere in the San
Juan Basin, it may be argued that the apparent differences would
disappear with the acquisition of more material. This may be so, but at
present the point can not be demonstrated.

It is not justified at present to maintain that the Angels Peak species
occupy an earlier position in the Torrejonian than do those obtained
from outcrops between Kimbetoh and the heads of the two forks of Arroyo
Torrejon. Indeed, the stratigraphic position of the Angels Peak pocket
with a considerable thickness of Torrejonian strata beneath it, tends
to argue against such a view. Nevertheless, it is possible, if not
probable, that such is the case, or at least that detailed work would
reveal a series of faunules of slightly different ages in the
Torrejonian stage of the Nacimiento formation. Of course, chance in
collecting, as well as geographic and ecologic differences, play their
part in giving such a local faunule as that at Angels Peak its somewhat
different aspect, but these factors may not account altogether for the
observed differences.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
