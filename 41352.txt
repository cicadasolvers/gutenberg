PREFACE.


THE mode of cookery which the author of the following sheets has pursued
for a series of years having obtained the most distinguished approbation
of the public, has induced him to commit his practice to paper; in doing
which, a deviation has been made from the usual introductory methods of
other treatises of the kind, in omitting to give particular directions
for the choice of fish, meats, poultry, and vegetables, and at what
times they respectively might be in season, &c. &c. the author
conceiving the simpler method to be the most acceptable: and,
therefore, as actual knowledge must ever supersede written forms, he
would advise a frequent attendance at the different markets, fully
assured that experience will convey greater instruction in marketing
than all the theories which could be advanced. There are, nevertheless,
some useful observations interspersed in the course of the work for that
purpose; the author having confined himself chiefly to the practical
part of cookery; he has also given some directions in a branch of the
confectionary business: in both of which it has been his constant
endeavour that they might be rendered as simple and easy as possible,
and that economy might pervade the whole.

The receipts are written for the least possible quantities in the
different made-dishes and sauces, it being a frequent error in most of
the books that they are too expensive and too long; by which means the
art has been rendered intricate in the extreme, both in theory and
practice.

Independent, also, of a close adherence to any given rules, there are
other qualities essential to the completion of a thorough cook; such as,
an acute taste, a fertile invention, and a rigid attention to
cleanliness.

The preceding hints and subsequent directions, it is hoped, will prove
fully adequate to perfection in cookery; the work being entirely
divested of the many useless receipts from other professions, (which
have been uniformly introduced in books of the like nature,) and
nothing inserted but what has an immediate reference to the art itself.

There is prefixed a Bill of Fare for each month in the year, as a
specimen of the seasons, which may be altered as judgment directs. There
is annexed, also, at the end of the volume, an Index, by which, from the
first letter or word of the different articles, will be found their
respective receipts.

    February 2d, 1802.

THE

ART OF COOKERY.


_Beef Stock._

CUT chuck beef into pieces, put it into a pot, set it on the fire, with
a sufficient quantity of water to cover it. When it boils skim it clean;
add a bunch of parsley and thyme, cleaned carrots, leeks, onions,
turnips, celery, and a little salt. Let the meat boil till tender, skim
off the fat, then strain it through a fine hair sieve.


_Veal Stock, for Soups._

TAKE a leg of veal and some lean ham, cut them into pieces, put them
into a pan with a quart of water, some peeled carrots, turnips, onions,
leeks, and celery; draw them down till nearly tender, but of no colour;
then add a sufficient quantity of beef stock to cover the ingredients,
boil all together one hour, skim it free from fat, and strain it. Some
game drawn down with it will make it excellent.

N. B. I have directed the veal stock not to be drawn down to a colour,
as in that state it will answer two purposes; first, for white soups;
and, secondly, as it might be coloured with a bright liquid to any
height, which will be directed for gravy soups. It frequently happens,
likewise, that, if not strictly attended to, it will burn.


_Consume, or the Essence of Meat._

REDUCE veal stock to a good consistence, but be careful not to let it
colour.


_Cullis, or a thick Gravy._

TAKE slices of ham, veal, celery, carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, a
small bunch of sweet herbs, some allspice, black pepper, mace, a piece
of lemon-peel, and two bay leaves; put them into a pan with a quart of
water, and draw them down till of a light brown colour, but be careful
not to let it burn; then discharge it with beef stock. When it boils,
skim it very clean from fat, and thicken it with flour and water, or
flour and butter passed. Let it boil gently three quarters of an hour;
season it to the palate with cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt;
strain it through a tamis cloth or sieve, and add a little liquid of
colour, which may be made as in the following receipt.


_Liquid of Colour for Sauces, &c._

PUT a quarter of a pound of the best brown sugar into a frying pan very
clean from grease, and half a gill of water; set it over a gentle fire,
stirring it with a wooden spoon till it is thoroughly burnt and of a
good bright colour, then discharge it with water; when it boils skim it
and strain it. Put it by for use in a vessel close covered.


_Benshamelle._

TAKE white veal, lean ham, turnips, celery, onions cut in pieces, a
blade of mace, a little whole white pepper; sweat them down till three
parts tender, then discharge it with beef stock. Let it boil, skim it
clean, and thicken with flour and water, or flour and butter passed; add
to it a sufficient quantity of cream to make it quite white. Let it
simmer gently half an hour, and strain it through a tamis cloth.

N. B. Let it be of the thickness of light batter.


_To make a passing of Flour and Butter for Cullis or Benshamelle._

PUT fresh butter into a stewpan over a fire, when it is melted add a
sufficient quantity of sifted flour to make it into a paste, and mix
them together with a whisk over a very slow fire for ten minutes.


_Soup a la Reine._

TAKE three quarts of veal stock with a blade of mace boiled in it; then
strain it to the crumb of four penny french rolls, three quarters of a
pound of sweet almonds blanched and pounded very fine, likewise the
white meat of dressed fowl pounded. Let all simmer together for ten
minutes, and rub them through a tamis cloth till the soup is of a proper
thickness; season it to the palate with salt; make it boil, and serve it
up with a gill of cream in it.


_Crayfish Soup._

TAKE three quarts of veal stock, the crumb of four penny french rolls,
the meats of a hen lobster, and half a hundred crayfish pounded, with
some live lobster spawn; add all together, make it boil, skim it clean,
rub it through a tamis cloth, make it of a middling thickness, and
season to the palate with salt and a little cayenne pepper. Serve it up
with crust of french bread cut into small round pieces.


_Vermicelli Soup, white._

TAKE three quarts of veal stock and two ounces of vermicelli, boil them
together a quarter of an hour, rub it through a tamis cloth, season with
salt, make it boil, skim it, and add a leason. Let it simmer for five
minutes.


_To make the Leason._

TAKE the yolks of four eggs, half a pint of cream, and a little salt,
mixed well together.


_Cleared brown Stock for Gravy Soups._

TAKE three quarts of veal stock perfectly free from fat; add a small
quantity of liquid colour to make it of a fine brown; season to the
palate with salt and a little cayenne pepper; beat up together two
yolks, two whites, and two shells of eggs; whisk them with the stock,
set it over a fire, let it boil gently ten minutes, then strain it
through a tamis cloth. This stock is required for rice, brown
vermicelli, celery, sante, or turnip soups.

N. B. I have directed the brown stock, for gravy soups only, to be
cleared with eggs, as that method has been most approved, it being
pleasant to the eye, and equally agreeable to the palate.


_Rice Soup._

ADD to three quarts of cleared stock two ounces of rice, washed, picked,
parboiled, and drained dry. Let it boil gently till the rice is tender.


_Celery Soup._

CUT celery heads two inches long then, some of the white part into small
pieces; wash, blanch, and drain it, and put to it three quarts of
cleared stock. Make it boil, skim it, and let the celery simmer till
tender.


_Turnip Soup._

PARE good and firm turnips, cut them with a knife or scoop into shapes,
fry them with a bit of lard till of a light brown colour, then drain and
wipe them free from fat (or they may be steamed with a very little
water, to prevent them from burning, till they are half done); then put
to them cleared stock, and boil them gently till tender.


_Cressey Soup._

TAKE twelve large red carrots, scrape them clean, cut off only the red
part in thin slices, and put them in a stewpan with a quart of water;
add cleaned turnips, celery, leeks, and onions, cut in pieces, and half
a pint of split peas. Stew all together till tender, adding some stock
to prevent burning; then rub it through a tamis, and put to the pulp
five pints of veal stock and some blanched water-cresses; make it boil
for twenty minutes, skim it, season it with salt, and serve it up.

N. B. To be the thickness of peas soup.


_Sante, or Spring Soup._

PARE, and cut into shapes, turnips and carrots, likewise celery heads
about two inches long; wash them, and steam them separately with a very
little water till they are three parts done; then cut the white part of
the celery into small pieces, likewise leeks, cabbage, cos lettuces,
endive, and chervil, of each a small quantity; blanch and drain them
dry, then put all the vegetables together; add to them three quarts of
cleared brown stock, and boil them gently till tender. In spring add
young green peas, tops of asparagus, and button onions, steamed as the
above.

N. B. A small piece of bouillie beef may be stewed till tender; and ten
minutes before it is to be served up wipe it dry, and put it into the
soup with the vegetables.


_Onion Soup._

TAKE eight middling-sized peeled onions, cut them into very thin slices,
pass them with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter and flour till
tender; then add three quarts of veal stock; make it boil twenty
minutes; skim it, season it with salt, and add a leason; mix it well
with a whisk, make it simmer, and serve it up.


_Green Peas Soup._

TAKE one quart of young green peas, four turnips pared and cut in the
form of dice, two cos lettuces cut in small slices, two middling-sized
onions cut very fine; wash them, add a quarter of a pound of fresh
butter, and stew them till nearly done. Then take two quarts of large
fresh green peas, and boil them in three quarts of veal stock till
tender; strain and pound them, preserving the liquor; then rub the peas
through a tamis, and add the pulp with the liquor to the above herbs, a
little flour and water, pepper and salt, and season to the palate, with
a bit of sugar if approved. Boil all together half an hour; skim it and
when it is to be served up, add the pulp of some boiled parsley rubbed
through a tamis to make it look green.

N. B. Cut pieces of bread into thin sippets, dry them before the fire,
and serve up on a plate.


_Old Peas Soup._

TAKE chuck beef cut into pieces, knuckles of ham and veal, pickle pork
cut into square pieces of half a pound each; put all into a pot with
peeled turnips, leeks, onions, carrots, and celery, cut into slices, and
some old split peas, with a sufficient quantity of water; when it boils,
skim it, and add a very small bunch of dried mint. Let the ingredients
boil till tender, then take the mint out, rub the soup through a tamis
till of a good thickness; when done, add to the liquor, turnips cut in
form of dice, celery and leeks cut small and washed. Make the soup boil,
skim it, season with pepper and salt, and serve it up with the pork in
it. Some bread cut in form of dice, and fried, to be served up on a
dish.

N. B. The pork to be taken out when nearly done, and added to the soup
half an hour before it is served up.


_Peas Soup another way._

PUT the peas with the above-mentioned vegetables into a pot with some
water; stew them gently till tender, then add a little dried mint, and
rub them through a tamis cloth; put the pulp to some good veal stock,
likewise add some turnips pared and cut into forms like dice, some leeks
and celery cut small and blanched; season to the palate with pepper and
salt; then making it boil, skim it, and stew the herbs till tender.
Serve it up with pieces of pickle pork in it.

N. B. The pickle pork to be cut into small square pieces and boiled till
nearly done, and then added to the soup a quarter of an hour before it
is to be served up to table. Let the soup be of a proper thickness.


_Giblet Soup._

LET the giblets be scalded, picked clean, and cut in pieces; which done,
put them in a stewpan, season them with herbs and spice, the same as for
real turtle; add some veal stock, stew them till nearly done, pick them
free from the herbs, chop the bones down, strain, thicken, and season
the liquor, as for real turtle; make it boil, then add it to the
giblets, stew them till tender, and serve them up with egg and forcemeat
balls.


_Fish Meagre Soup._

TAKE pieces of different sorts of fish, such as salmon, skate, soles,
&c. Sweat them till tender, with turnip, onion, celery, a clove of
garlick, and a blade of mace; then add some plain veal broth. Let all
simmer together for half an hour; then strain and skim it free from fat;
season with salt and cayenne pepper; clear it with white of eggs, and
colour with a little saffron.

N. B. It may be served up with celery or rice in it.


_Mock Turtle of Calf's Head._

TAKE a scalp cleaned by the butcher, scald it for twenty minutes, then
wash it clean, cut it into pieces two inches square, add a gallon of
veal stock, and boil them till nearly done. Have ready some pieces of
veal cut in form of dice, but four times larger, seasoned with herbs,
spices, and onions, the same as real turtle; and strain to it the liquor
the scalp is boiled in. Let the meat simmer till almost done; pick it,
and add to it the scalp with forcemeat and egg balls; then thicken the
liquor as for real turtle, and when it boils skim it clean, put it to
the meats, and simmer all together half an hour.


_Mutton Broth._

TAKE a neck of mutton cut into pieces, preserving a handsome _piece_ to
be served up in the tureen. Put all in a stewpot with three quarts of
cold beef stock, or water with a little oatmeal mixed in it, some
turnips, onions, leeks, celery cut in pieces, and a small bunch of thyme
and parsley. When it boils skim it clean, and take the _piece_ of mutton
out when nearly done, and let the other boil till tender; then have
ready turnips cut in form of dice, some leeks, celery, half a cabbage,
and parsley, all cut small, and some marigolds; wash them, strain the
liquor of the meat, skim it free from fat, add it to the ingredients,
with the _piece_ of mutton, and a little pearl barley if approved;
season with salt, simmer all together till done, and serve it up with
toasted bread on a plate.


_Real Turtle._

HANG the turtle up by the hind fins, and cut off the head overnight; in
the morning cut off the fore fins at the joints, and the callipee all
round; then take out the entrails, and be careful not to break the gall;
after which cut off the hind fins and all the meat from the bones,
callipee and callipash; then chop the callipee and callipash into
pieces; scald them together, the fins being whole, but take care not to
let the scales set. When cleaned, chop the fins into pieces four inches
long; wash the pieces of the callipee, callipash, and fins, and put
them into a pot with the bones and a sufficient quantity of water to
cover; then add a bunch of sweet herbs and whole onions, and skim it
when the liquor boils. When the fins are nearly done take them out,
together with the remainder of the turtle, when done, picked free from
bone. Then strain the liquor and boil it down till reduced to one third
part; after which cut the meat into pieces four times larger than dice;
put it into a pot, add a mixture of herbs chopped fine, such as knotted
marjoram, savory, thyme, parsley, a very little basil, some chopped
onions, some beaten spices, as allspice, a few cloves, a little mace,
black pepper, salt, some veal stock, and the liquor that was reduced.
Boil the meat till three parts done, pick it free from herbs, strain the
liquor through a tamis sieve, make a passing of flour and three quarters
of a pound of fresh butter, mixing it well over a fire for some time,
and then add to it madeira wine, (if a turtle of seventy pounds weight,
three pints,) and the liquor of the meat. When it boils, skim it clean,
season to the palate with cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt, and
strain it to the pieces of fins and shell in one pot, and the lean meat
into another; and if the turtle produce any real green fat, let it be
boiled till done, then strained, cut into pieces, and added to the fins
and shell, and then simmer each meat till tender. When it is to be
served up, put a little fat at the bottom of the tureens, some lean in
the center, and more fat at the top, with egg and force-meat balls, and
a few entrails.

N. B. The entrails must be cleaned well, then boiled in water till very
tender, and preserved as white as possible, and just before they are
strained off add the balls. If a callipash is served up, the shell to be
cut down on each side, and chop the pieces for the soup; the remaining
part of the back shell to be pasted round with a raised crust, egged,
ornamented, and baked, and the soup served in it in the same manner as
in the tureens.


_Callipee._

TAKE a quarter of the under part of a turtle of sixty pounds weight, and
scald it, and when done, take the shoulder-bone out and fill the cavity
with a good high-seasoned forcemeat made with the lean of the turtle;
put it into a stewpan, and add a pint of madeira wine, cayenne pepper,
salt, lemon juice, a clove of garlick, a little mace, a few cloves and
allspice tied in a bag, a bunch of sweet herbs, some whole onions, and
three quarts of good beef stock. Stew gently till three parts done; then
take the turtle and put it into another stewpan, with some of the
entrails boiled and some egg balls; add a little thickening of flour and
butter to the liquor, let it boil, and strain it to the turtle, &c. then
stew it till tender, and the liquor almost reduced to a glaize. Serve it
up in a deep dish, pasted round as a callipash, ornamented and baked.

N. B. I think the above mode of serving it up in a dish the best, as it
frequently happens that the shell of the callipee is not properly baked.


_Glaize for Hams, Larding, roasted Poultry, &c._

TAKE a leg of veal, lean of ham, beef, some indifferent fowls, celery,
turnips, carrots, onions, leeks cleaned and cut into pieces, a little
lemon peel, mace, and black pepper, a small quantity of each; add three
quarts of water, sweat them down till three parts done, discharge with
water, and boil it till the goodness is extracted; then skim it, and
strain the liquor into a large pan. Next day take the fat from it very
clean; set the stock over a fire, and when warm clear it with whites and
a few yolks of eggs; then add a little colour and strain it through a
tamis; boil it quick till reduced to a glaize, and be careful not to let
it burn.

N. B. In the same manner may be made glaize of separate herbs or roots,
which will be serviceable on board a ship, or in the country, where
herbs or roots cannot be procured at all times; and they are to be
preserved in bottles, as they will not, when cold, be of a portable
substance.


_Fish plain boiled to be prepared thus:_

PUT them in clean boiling pump water well salted, and when served up to
be garnished with fresh picked parsley and scraped horseradish; except
salt fish, which should be properly soaked, then cut in pieces and put
in cold water, and when it boils let it simmer six or eight minutes, and
serve it up on a napkin with boiled parsnips and potatoes round, or on a
plate, and egg sauce in a boat.

N. B. Fish should be chosen very fresh and of good appearance, it adding
as much to their beauty as gratifying to the palate when dressed, there
being in my opinion but two sorts--good and bad. But as an exception to
the above observation, skate will be better for eating if kept for one
or two days in a cool place before it is dressed.


_Fish generally fried._

    PIECES of skate.
    Whitings.
    Fillets of haddocks.

over them with a paste brush; then put crumbs of bread over the egg.
Have plenty of lard in an iron frying pan, and when it almost boils put
a proper quantity and fry them of a fine gold colour; drain them dry,
and serve them up with fried parsley.

N. B. The crumbs to be rubbed through a hair sieve. The parsley also to
be picked, washed, and dried with a cloth, then to be put into the lard
not very hot, and fried of a green colour. Sprinkle a little salt over.


_Broiled Fish prepared thus:_

WIPE the fish dry, flour them well, and have the gridiron clean; then
rub the bars with a veal caul, and put the fish at a proper distance.
Broil them gently over a clear coal fire till of a fine colour, and
serve them up directly.

N. B. Fish in general to be floured, except herrings, which are only to
be scored with a knife, and the following methods of broiling other fish
to be observed.


_Broiled Salmon to be prepared thus:_

then stew it gently, and serve it up in a deep dish with the liquor, and
fried bread round it. If carp or tench, some of the hard roe mixed in
batter and fried in pieces. The roes likewise of different fish may be
stewed in the same manner, and served up as a dish of themselves. Eels,
soles, or other fish may be done the same way.


_Water souchee of Perch, Flounders, Soles, Eels, &c._

TAKE perch cleaned and fresh crimped; put them into boiling pump water
well-seasoned with salt, and when they boil, skim them clean. Take them
out with a large skimmer, put them into a deep dish, strew parsley roots
and scalded parsley over, and add some of the liquor. Serve them up as
hot as possible, with slices of brown bread and butter on a plate.

N. B. The time the fish are to boil must be according to their size; and
the parsley roots are to be cleaned, cut into slips, and boiled by
themselves till tender.


_Roasted Pike or Sturgeon._

LET the fish be well cleaned, then make a stuffing of capers,

into a pot, cover with water, and when it boils skim clean; then add
carrots, celery, turnips, onions, leeks, garlick, parsley, and thyme,
tied in a bunch; allspice, cloves, nutmeg, black pepper, mace, and a

and ears cleaned; hare cut into joints and daubed with bacon; bouillie
beef tied round with packthread; poultry trussed very neat, with the
legs drawn in close; the tongues scalded and cleaned; and the rabbits

them, then braise each in a separate stewpan, with the stock that was
strained. When the different things are braised enough, pour the liquors
from them into a pan, leaving a little with each to preserve from
burning. When they are to be served up, skim the liquor very clean, and
clear it with whites of eggs; then cut turnips and carrots into
haricots, some button onions peeled, and heads of celery trimmed neat;
after which blanch them, cut the bologna sausage into slices, boil the
burgonza peas till three parts done, then mix all together, add some of
the cleared liquor, and stew them gently till done. The remainder of the
liquor to be coloured with a little saffron, and served up in a tureen
with a few burgonza peas in it.

When the olio is to be served up, take a very large deep dish, make
several partitions in it with slips of fried bread dipped in whites of
eggs, and set it in a slow oven or before a fire; then lay the
tendrons, birds, beef, mutton, fowls, &c. alternately in the partitions,
and serve up with the haricot roots, &c. over.

N. B. The whole of the liquor to be seasoned to the palate with cayenne
pepper and lemon juice.

[This receipt for a Spanish olio is only written to shew how expensive a
dish may be made, and which I saw done. As a substitute I have
introduced the following english one, which has been generally approved;
and I think, with particular attention, it will exceed the former in
flavour.]

carrots, onions, leeks, celery, one bay leaf, whole black pepper, a few
allspice, and a small quantity of mace. When the meats are nearly done,
add two quarts of strong veal stock, and when tender take them out, put
them into a deep dish, and preserve them hot till they are to be served
up; then strain the liquor, skim it free from fat, season to the palate
with cayenne pepper, a little salt, and lemon juice, and add a small
quantity of colour; then have ready turnips and carrots cut into
haricots, some celery heads trimmed three inches long, and some whole
onions peeled. Let them be sweated down, till three parts tender, in

_Directions for roasting._

OBSERVE that in roasting it requires a good quick fire, but not too
strong, and the meats should be well-jointed, trimmed neat, and covered
with paper to preserve it from being too high a colour. Beef and mutton
should not be done too much; veal, pork, and lamb, should be done well;
and some little time before it is to be served up, take the paper off,
sprinkle the meat with salt, and when of a proper colour, froth it with
butter and flour. Large poultry to be papered and done in the same
manner; but small poultry, such as chickens, woodcocks, rabbits, wild
fowls, &c. will not require papering. The time the several articles will
take roasting depends upon a little practice, as the weather and the
different strengths of fires make a material alteration. I have given
directions for some particular roasts which require a preparation; as
for others which are served with sauces, they may be found under their
respective heads: and for the trimmings of meat, &c. I have wrote a
receipt to make into soup, or they may be put into the beef stock pot.


_Soup for a Family._

CUT the particles of meat from the trimmings of different joints, as
beef, mutton, veal, pork, &c. and when done put the bones into a pot,
cover with water, and boil them till the goodness is extracted. Then
strain the liquor, wash the trimmings of the vegetables, such as
turnips, carrots, onions, leeks, celery, and a little cabbage. Cut all
small, put them into a pot with the above liquor and some split peas;
boil till the peas are tender, add a little dry mint, and rub it through
a tamis cloth or sieve. Then season the meat with pepper and salt,
sweated down till three parts tender, and add the pulp. Boil all
together till the meat is done, skim it and serve it up with fried bread
in the form of dice.

_Observations on Meat and Poultry._

MEATS to be preferred when of a good fatness and the lean appears juicy,
but not particularly streaked with fat, as it then frequently happens to
eat hard. When the season will permit let it hang for a week, and not
more, as I have found that period bring it to its best state. Poultry,
likewise, should be chosen tolerably fat and of a soft grain. Let them
hang three or four days, which will add to their better eating; except
woodcocks, snipes, larks, or pigs, which should be dressed fresh. Be

taking care it is of a good consistence but not too stiff, and then
raise it into any shape you please. Have ready part of a ham boiled till
half done, trim it to the shape of the crust, which must be big enough
to put some light forcemeat at the bottom and round the ham when in the
pie. Cover it with the same kind of paste, pinch round the top, and egg

the crust; then cover and ornament it as a raised chicken pie, and bake
it. When it is to be served up, take off the lid and the bards of bacon,
glaize the breast lightly, and add a cullis or green truffle sauce.

mixed with it.

N. B. I have directed puff paste to be used for meat pies, it having the
best appearance when baked; but there is another mode which may be
thought preferable; and which is, to mix together half a pound of sifted
flour, six ounces of fresh butter, the yolks and whites of two eggs well
beaten, and a little milk and salt; then knead it well.

_Directions for Poultry, &c. plain boiled._

LET it be observed that turkies, chickens, and meats, intended to be
plain boiled, should be soaked in cold water, and put afterwards into
plenty of boiling pump water, kept skimmed and preserved as white as
possible. The time they will take dressing depends on a little practice,
as in roasting. Be particular in trimming the meats neat, and in
trussing the poultry. The carving, likewise, should be carefully
attended to, which is frequently expressed by the phrase of _cutting
into pieces_.

teaspoon drop the mixture upon the paper in rows and bake them.


_To make Syllabub._

TO a pint and a half of cream add a pint of sweet wine, a gill of
brandy, sifted sugar, and a little lemon juice; whisk it well, take off
the froth with a spoon, lay it upon a large sieve, fill the glasses
three parts full with the liquor, add a little grated nutmeg, and put
the froth over.


_Trifle._

PUT into a deep china or glass dish half a pound of spunge biscuits, two
ounces of ratafias, two ounces of jordan almonds blanched and pounded,
citron and candied orange peel an ounce of each cut into small slices,
some currant jelly and raspberry jam, a small quantity of grated nutmeg
and lemon peel, half a pint of sweet wine, and a little of the liquor of
the syllabub. Then make the same kind of cream as for pies, and when
cold put it over the ingredients. When it is to be served up put plenty
of the stiff froth of a syllabub raised high on the cream, and garnish
with coloured comfits or rose leaves, which are recommended for
elegance.


_Tarts or Tartlets._

SHEET tart or tartlet pans with puff paste a quarter of an inch thick,
trim round the edge with a sharp knife; then fill with raspberry or
apricot jam, or orange marmalade or stewed apple, and put fine strings
of paste across in what form you please. Bake them in a brisk oven, and
be careful not to let the top colour too much.


_Paste for stringing Tartlets._

CUT a bit of puff paste into pieces, mix with it half a handful of
flour, a little cold water, and let it be of a moderate stiffness, and
mould it with the hands till it draws into fine threads. Roll a piece
out three inches long and two inches broad; then cut it into slips,
draw them out singly, and put them across the tarts in any form, which
may be repeated two or three times over each other, as it will add much
to their appearance when baked.


_To stew Apples for Tarts._

PARE, cut into quarters, and core, some apples; put them into a stewpan,
add to them a piece of lemon peel, a little water, and a stick of
cinnamon. Cover the pan close, put it over a fire till the apples are
dissolved, sweeten to the palate with sifted sugar, add a table spoonful
of syrup of cloves, and rub them through a hair sieve. Let it stand till
cold before it is put into the paste.

N. B. To make a very fine flavoured tart, stew golden pippins in the
same manner, and when they are rubbed through the sieve add only half a
table spoonful of syrup of cloves, and mix well with it a quarter of a
pound of pine-apple jam. This mixture will keep a month if close
covered.


_Fried Puffs with Sweetmeats._

ROLL out puff paste half an inch thick, cut it into slips of three
inches wide, the slips into square pieces, and put on each some
sweetmeat of any kind. Fold the paste, and run a jagger iron round to
form it, or cut it with a sharp knife. Have ready boiling lard, fry them
of a light colour, drain them dry, and serve them up with sifted sugar
over.


_Pyramid Paste._

TAKE a sheet of puff paste rolled of half an inch thick; cut or stamp it
into oval forms, the first to be the size of the bottom of the dish in
which it is to be served up, the second smaller, and so on till it
becomes a pyramid; then put each piece separately on paper laid on a
baking plate, and when the oven is ready, egg the top part of the pieces
and bake them of a light colour. When they are done take them off the
paper, lay them on a large dish till quite cold, and when to be served
up set the largest piece in the dish for which it was formed, and put on
it raspberry or apricot jams or currant jelly, the next size on that and
more sweetmeats, proceeding in the same manner till all the pieces are
placed on each other. Put dried fruits round the pyramid, such as green
gages, barberries, or cherries.

N. B. Instead of stamping the pieces it is thought better to cut them
with a sharp knife; then to cut out small pieces round the edges to make
them appear like spires, as, being done in this manner, it causes the
paste to appear lighter.


_Iceing for a Cake._

capillaire; then put it into a decanter, and when it is to be used shake
it together.


_Orange Marmalade._

TAKE seville oranges when in season, which is generally at the beginning

gill of syrup of cloves; then put them into a preserving pan, and let
them simmer together till of a good strength.

N. B. A little of this jam mixed with apples in a pie will make it very
good.

fruit. Have ready clarified sugar boiling hot, put the apricots into it,
and let them stand till cold. Then boil the syrup again, add the
apricots as before, and when they are cold put the halves into small
pots or glasses, and if the syrup is too thin boil it again, and when it
is cold put it to the fruit, and cover it with paper dipped in brandy.

N. B. Green gages may be done whole in the same manner, or green
gooseberries with the seeds taken out. These fruits may be served up
with the syrup; or they may be dried on tin plates, in a moderately
heated oven, and when almost cold put sifted sugar over.

AS frequent mention is made of syrups, jams, pounded spices, sugar
sifted, grated nutmeg, and orange flower water, to be used in puddings
and pies; and as a very small quantity of each is wanted at a time; it
is therefore recommended (as a saving of trouble and expence) that the
syrups, &c. be made when the fruits are in season, and preserved in
small bottles with the different stores. But should any of the receipts
be thought too expensive or rich, it is recommended, likewise, that a
curtailment be made in some of the articles, pursuing nearly the same
process, they being written in that state only to shew their first and
best manner. The same observation may be borne in remembrance with
respect to made dishes, roasting, pastry, or sauces.

and plenty of fried parsley round.


_To dry Herbs._

GATHER marjoram, savory, thyme, basil, parsley, &c. on a dry day, when

PASS them with the same ingredients as for veal, and when they are half
done take them out and put the lean veal in. When the forcemeat is made
put the birds into the pots with it, bake them, and proceed in the same
manner as with potted veal.

N. B. Pheasants, partridges, chickens, &c. may be done in the same way,
but will take a longer time baking.


_To dry Morells, Mushrooms, and Champignons._

TAKE morells and champignons of the largest size, forced mushrooms of
the size of a shilling, and let them be gathered fresh; then take off
the stalk, wash them free from grit, drain them dry with a cloth, run a
fine twine through them with a large needle, hang them up in a warm dry
place, and when they are perfectly dry put them into paper bags in boxes
close covered. When they are wanted for use lay them in warm water for
half an hour, and prepare them as if they were fresh.


_Mushroom Powder._

AFTER the mushrooms or champignons are dried whole they may be set
before a fire till crisp; then grind and sift them through a fine sieve,
and preserve the powder in small bottles close corked.


_Potted Beef._

TAKE two pounds of the fillet out of the inside of a rump of beef and
two pounds of best fat bacon. Cut them small, put them into a marble
mortar, add to them a small quantity of parsley, thyme, savory, four
eschallots chopped fine, some pepper, salt, two spoonsful of essence of
ham, a spoonful of mushroom powder, sifted mace, cloves, and allspice, a
little of each, two eggs beaten, and a gill of rhenish wine. Pound all
well together till quite fine; then fill small pots with the mixture,
cover with paper, bake it very gently for forty minutes, and when cold
cover with clarified butter.


_Tarragon Vinegar._

PUT into a stone jar half a pound of fresh gathered tarragon leaves and
two quarts of best common vinegar, and let them ferment a fortnight;
then run it through a flannel bag, and add to it a quarter of an ounce
of isinglass dissolved in cyder. Put it into a clean jar, let it stand
till fine, pour it off, put it into small bottles, cork them close, and
set them in a dry place.

N. B. In the same manner may be done elder flowers, &c. &c.


_Walnut Ketchup for Fish Sauces._

TO a quart of walnut pickle add a quarter of a pound of anchovies and
three gills of red port; boil them till reduced one third, strain it,
and when cold preserve it in small bottles close corked.


_To pickle Tongues, &c._

TAKE large tongues perfectly fresh, cut some of the root away, make an
incision in the under part, rub them well with common salt, and lay
them in a tub or pan close covered for four days. Then pound together
two parts of saltpetre, one part of common salt, one part of bay salt,
and one part of moist sugar. Rub the tongues well with the mixture, put
all into the pan, and turn them every two days till pickled enough,
which will be in ten days.

N. B. Pigs faces and hams to be done in the same manner, but according
to their size let them lay in the different pickles for longer periods,
and when well coloured smoke them. If it be wished to have the hams or
tongues of a westphalia flavour add some socho to the pickle.


_India Pickle._

TAKE large fresh cauliflowers in the month of July, pick them into small
pieces, wash them clean, put them into a pan with plenty of salt over
them for three days; then drain and lay them separately to dry in the
sun, repeatedly turning them till they are almost of a brown colour,
which will require several days. Then put plenty of whole ginger, slices
of horseradish, peeled garlick, whole long pepper, peeled eschallots and
onions, into salt and water for one night; drain and dry them also; and
when the ingredients are ready, boil more than a sufficient quantity of
vinegar to cover them, and to two quarts of it add an ounce of the best
pale turmeric, and put the flowers and the other ingredients into stone
jars, pour the vinegar boiling hot over, cover them till the next day,
then boil the pickle again, and the same on the third day; after which
fill the jars with liquor, cover them over close with bladder and white
leather, and set them in a dry place.

N. B. In the same manner may be done white cabbages cut into half
quarters, whole french beans, heads of celery, heads of asparagus,
onions whole or sliced, or pickling melons peeled thin, cut into halves,
and formed like an indian mango.


_To dry Artichoke Bottoms._

GATHER the largest firm artichokes when in season, cut off the stalks,
and boil them till the leaves and choke can be taken away. Afterwards
put them on a baking plate and set them in a very slow heated oven, or
hang them up in a warm place to dry, and when perfectly so put them into
paper bags. When they are wanted for use lay them in warm water and
salt, and when pliable trim them neat, braise them in stock and lemon
juice, which will preserve them white, and when they are done enough, if
for ragout, cut them into pieces; if for dishes, serve them whole with
good cullis sauce over them.


_To pickle Cucumbers, &c._

GATHER jerkins not too large, lay them in a strong brine of salt and
water for three days, then wipe them dry, and put them into stone jars.
Then put a sufficient quantity of vinegar to cover them into a
preserving pan, add plenty of whole ginger and black pepper, a middling
quantity of mace, allspice and cloves, some slices of horseradish,
peeled onions, eschallots, and a small quantity of garlick. Let the
ingredients boil for ten minutes, and pour them with the liquor over the
cucumbers; cover the jars with cabbage leaves and a plate, set them in a
warm place, the next day drain the liquor from them, boil it, and pour
over them again, and if on the third day they are not green enough, boil
the vinegar again, pour it over, and when cold tie bladder and white
leather over the jars, and set them in a dry place.

N. B. In the same manner may be done walnuts, love apples, barberries,
capsicums, french beans, nasturtiums, and small pickling melons peeled
very thin and cut into quarters.


_Rules to be observed in Pickling._

IT is recommended that the best common vinegar be in general used for
pickling, and that it be put into a well-cleaned copper or
brass-preserving pan just before it is to be put over the fire, and when
it boils not to remain in the pan.

There can be no occasion of the many arts that are used in order to
preserve the ingredients green, if the vegetables are gathered fresh, on
a dry day, when in season, and the process followed that has been
recommended.

Further directions could be given that might be attended with greater
expence, but which would scarcely answer a better purpose, excepting
only to those who are in the habit of extensive practice.


_To pickle Onions._

PEEL small button onions into milk and water, in which put plenty of
salt; set it over a fire, and when it boils strain the onions, wipe them
dry, and put them into glasses. Have ready cold white wine vinegar, in
which whole white pepper, ginger, mace, and slices of horseradish have
been boiled. Pour it over the onions, and cover them with bladder and
leather.


_To pickle Mushrooms._

TAKE a sufficient quantity of double distilled white wine vinegar to
cover the mushrooms; add to it whole white pepper, ginger, mace, peeled
eschallots, and a small quantity of garlick if approved; boil all
together ten minutes and let it stand till cold. Then peel fresh forced
button mushrooms into water, wash them clean, strain, and put them into
a stewpan. To a quart of mushrooms add the juice of a lemon and a table
spoonful of salt. Cover the pan close, set it over a fire, and when the
liquor is sufficiently drawn from the mushrooms put the whole into
glasses and cover them with the pickle. Tie bladder and white leather
over the glasses.

The general rule has been deviated from of making the pickle for onions
and mushrooms with double distilled white wine vinegar, as in this
instance it is requisite to preserve them white. It is likewise
recommended that they be put into small jars or glasses for use; for
this reason, that, if exposed to the air but for a short space of time,
they will discolour.


_To pickle Beet Roots._

BOIL the roots till three parts done, and cut them into slices of an
inch thick. Then take a sufficient quantity of vinegar to cover them,
and add to it whole allspice, a few cloves, mace, black pepper, slices
of horseradish, some onions, eschallots, a little pounded ginger, some
salt, and a few bay leaves. Boil the ingredients together twenty minutes
and strain it, and when the pickle is cold add a little bruised
cochineal. Put the slices of beet into jars, add the pickle, put a small
quantity of sweet oil on the top, and tie the jars down close.

N. B. When the beet is wanted for use mix well together sweet oil,
mustard, some of the liquor in which the roots were pickled, and a very
little sifted sugar. Lay the slices in a deep plate and pour the mixture
over.


_To pickle Artichoke Bottoms._

TAKE large fresh and sound artichokes, boil them just enough to take
the leaves and choke away, then trim and lay them in salt and water;
after which boil (for five minutes) a sufficient quantity of vinegar to
cover them, in which put whole allspice, black pepper, ginger, mace,
cloves, eschallots, salt, a few bay leaves, and some slices of
horseradish. Drain and wipe dry the bottoms, put them into jars, add the
liquor and ingredients to them, and tie them down close. When they are
fit for use serve them up in a deep plate with a little of the pickle,
oil, and mustard mixed with it.


_To pickle large Cucumbers._

PEEL them very thin, cut them into halves, throw the seeds away, and lay
the cucumbers in salt for a day. Then wipe them dry, fill them with
mustard seed, peeled eschallots, garlick, small slips of horseradish,
and mace. After which tie them round with twine, put them into jars,
pour over them some boiling liquor made as for india pickle or for
jerkins, and cover them down close till fit for use.


_To pickle Red Cabbage._

CUT a fresh light red cabbage into slips, wash it clean, and put it into
a pan with plenty of salt for two days. Then boil together for half an
hour a sufficient quantity of vinegar to cover the cabbage, together
with bruised black pepper, mace, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and
mustard seed, a middling quantity of each. Strain the vinegar and
ingredients, and let them stand till cold; then add a little bruised
cochineal, drain the cabbage on a large sieve till dry, put it into the
jars, add the pickle, and tie the jars down close; or the liquor may be
poured over the cabbage boiling hot; and when cold, before the jars are
tied down, add a little bruised cochineal. This method will make the
cabbage sooner fit for use.

N. B. Onions may be peeled and done whole in the same manner, and mixed
with red cabbage.


_To pickle Currants._

TO a quart of double distilled white wine vinegar add half a pound of
loaf sugar, whole ginger, one ounce of salt, and a pint of red currant
juice; boil all together, skim it clean, and let it stand till cold.
Then pick and put some best ripe red currants into glasses, fill them
with the pickle, and cover them down close with bladder and leather.


_To pickle Barberries._

BRUISE and strain ripe barberries, and to a pint of juice add three
pints of vinegar, a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, an ounce of salt,
and a quarter of an ounce of pounded and sifted ginger. Boil all
together, skim it clean, and put bunches of the best ripe barberries
into jars, pour the pickle boiling hot over, and let it stand till cold;
then add a little bruised cochineal, and tie the jars over close.

N. B. Bunches of currants may be done in like manner.


_Sour Crout._

TAKE large white cabbages when in season, cut them into halves, and then
into slips; wash them clean and drain them dry. After which put into a
tub a layer of cabbage, then a layer of salt, afterwards a small
quantity of pounded and sifted coriander seeds, and so on alternately;
when the tub is nearly full put a weight over to press it well, and set
it in a cold dry place covered with a coarse cloth. When it is wanted
for use put some of the cabbage into boiling water over a fire for five
minutes, and strain it. Have ready some pieces of salted bouillie beef
(of a quarter of a pound each) nearly boiled enough; likewise some
pieces of pickle pork of the same number and weight. Then put them into
a stewpan, add the cabbage, fresh butter, a little vinegar, onions
sliced very thin, some whole pepper, allspice, and mace, tied in a bit
of cloth. Let all stew till tender; then take out the spices, season the
cabbage to the palate with cayenne pepper, and serve it up with fried
onions (done as per receipt), with fried sausages round the crout.


_Peas Pudding, to be eaten with boiled Pork._

LAY a pint of best split peas into water for half an hour; strain, pick,
and put them into a cloth, tie them tight, and boil them gently for
three hours. Then put the peas out of the cloth into a stewpan, mash
them well with a wooden spoon, add a bit of fresh butter, a little
pepper and salt, the yolks of two eggs, and mix all well together. Put
the mixture into a clean cloth, tie it up, and let it hang near a fire
for half an hour; then turn it out on a dish, and pour melted butter
over.


_Currie, or Pepper Water._

CUT a chicken into pieces, blanch and wash it, put it into a small
stewpot, add a table spoonful of currie powder, half a pint of veal
broth, and simmer them till half done. Then peel and cut into thin
slices two good sized onions, fry them with two ounces of fresh butter
till nearly done and of a brown colour; then add them to the chicken,
together with a pint of veal broth, half a bay leaf, the juice of half a
lemon, two table spoonfuls of the juice of tamarinds, which are to be
dissolved in boiling water and strained. Boil all together till the
chicken is nearly done; then take it out, put it into another stewpan,
rub the ingredients through a tamis sieve, and add it to the fowl with
a table spoonful of flour and water to thicken it. Make it boil, season
it well to the palate with cayenne pepper and salt, skim it clean, and
serve it up in a bowl.


_Grills and Sauce, which are generally eaten after Dinner._

SEASON some small pieces of ready-dressed fowl or turkey with pepper and
salt, and grill them gently till of a nice brown colour. In the mean
time put into a stewpan a gill and a half of cullis, an ounce of fresh
butter, a table spoonful of mushroom ketchup, the juice of a lemon, and
a small bit of the rind, a little cayenne pepper, a tea spoonful of the
essence of anchovies, and one eschallot chopped fine. Boil all the
ingredients together five minutes, strain the liquor, and serve it up in
a sauceboat; the pieces of chicken, &c. on a dish.


_Salme of Woodcocks._

TAKE two woodcocks half roasted, cut them up neatly, and let the
trimmings with the entrails be pounded in a marble mortar; then put them
into a stewpan, add half a pint of cullis, two eschallots chopped, half
a gill of red port, and a bit of rind of lemon; season to the palate
with pepper, salt, and lemon juice. Boil the ingredients ten minutes,
and strain the liquor to the carved woodcocks, which stew gently till
done. Serve them up in a deep dish with sippets of fried bread strewed
over.


_To make a Haggess._

TAKE the heart and lights of a sheep, and blanch and chop them; then add
a pound of beef suet chopped very fine, crumb of french roll soaked in
cream, a little beaten cinnamon, mace, cloves, and nutmeg, half a pint
of sweet wine, a pound of raisins stoned and chopped, a sufficient
quantity of flour to make it of a proper consistence, a little salt, the

mace, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice, a small quantity of each, a gill of
cream with a bit of crumb of french bread soaked in it, together with
chopped savory, thyme, parsley, and pennyroyal, a little of each. Mix
the ingredients over a slow fire for twenty minutes, and when cold put
with them plenty of the flay cut into small dice. Have ready the
entrails cleaned very nice, fill them with the mixture three parts full,
tie the ends, put the puddings into hot water, boil them gently a
quarter of an hour; if they are to be eaten directly when done, prick
them with a fork and broil them upon a very clean gridiron for ten
minutes: if they are not to be eaten immediately when made, put them on
clean straw, and when they are wanted for use put them into boiling
water, let them simmer ten minutes, then take them out, and prick and
broil them as above.

N. B. If large puddings they will take longer periods in boiling and
broiling.


_Milk Punch._

TO a gallon of milk add a little cinnamon, cloves, mace, lemon and
orange peel, a pint of brandy, a pint of rum, plenty of orange and
lemon juice, and sweeten to the palate. Then whisk with it the yolks and
whites of eight eggs, put it over a brisk fire, and when it boils let it
simmer ten minutes; run it through a jelly bag till quite clear, put it
into bottles, and cork it close.

N. B. The rum and brandy should be added when the milk is cleared.


_Plum Pottage._

TO veal and beef broths (a quart of each) add a pound of stoned pruens

grated lemon peel, and season to the palate with lump sugar. Let all
simmer together for one hour; then add a little cochineal to make it of
a nice colour, and serve it up in a tureen. Let it be of the consistence
of water gruel.


_Candied Orange or Lemon Peels._

TAKE either lemon or orange peels well cleaned from the pulp, and lay
them in salt and water for two days; then scald and drain them dry, put
them into a thin syrup, and boil them till they look clear. After which
take them out, and have ready a thick syrup made with fine loaf sugar;
put them into it, and simmer till the sugar candies about the pan and
peels. Then lay them separately on a hair sieve to drain, strew sifted
sugar over, and set them to dry in a slow oven; or the peels may be cut
into chips, and done in the same manner.


_Lemonade or Orangeade._

TO a gallon of spring water add some cinnamon and cloves, plenty of
orange and lemon juices, with a bit of each peel; sweeten well with loaf
sugar, and whisk with it the whites of six eggs and one yolk. Put it
over a brisk fire, and when it boils let it simmer ten minutes; then run
it through a jelly bag, and let it stand till cold before it is drunk.
This mode is recommended, the liquor having been boiled.

vinegar, a table spoonful of veal consume, half an anchovie rubbed
through a fine sieve, a little cayenne pepper, and salt. Serve it up in
a sauceboat cold, if to be eaten with cold game; but if to be eaten
with hot, roast, or grills, make it boiling.


_Lobster Sauce for Fish._

TAKE the spawn out of live lobsters before they are boiled, bruise it
well in a marble mortar, add a little cold water, strain it through a
sieve and preserve it till wanted; then boil the lobsters, and when
three parts done pick and cut the meat into small pieces, and put it
into a stewpan. To the meat of a large lobster add a pound of fresh
butter and a pint of water, including a sufficient quantity of the spawn
liquor to colour it. Put it over a fire, thicken it with flour and
water, keep stirring till it boils, and then season to the palate with
anchovie liquor, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper. Let it simmer five
minutes and skim it.

N. B. In place of the above the following method may be
adopted:--Instead of cutting the meat of the lobster into pieces, it
may be pounded in a marble mortar, then rubbed through a tamis cloth,
and the pulp put with the other ingredients when the sauce is to be
made. [See _Anchovie Essence for Fish Sauce_.]


_Oyster Sauce for Fish._

BLANCH the oysters, strain them, and preserve their liquor; then wash
and beard them, drain, and put them into a stewpan; then add fresh
butter and the oyster liquor free from sediment, some flour and water to
thicken it, season to the palate with lemon juice, anchovie liquor, a
little cayenne pepper, a spoonful of ketchup if approved, and a bit of
lemon peel. When it boils skim it, and let it simmer five minutes.

N. B. Muscles and cockles may be done in like manner.


_Shrimp Sauce for Fish._

BOIL live shrimps in salt and water for three minutes, then pick, wash,
and drain them dry; after which add fresh butter, water, anchovie
liquor, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and flour and water to make it of a
sufficient thickness. Put the ingredients over a fire, and when it boils
skim it, and let the shrimps simmer for five minutes. Or it may be made
thus:--When the shrimps are picked, wash the shells, drain them dry, put
them into a stewpan, add a little water, and boil them ten minutes; then
strain the liquor to the butter (as above) instead of the water, which
will make it of a better flavour. The bodies of lobsters, also, when
picked, may be done in like manner for lobster sauce.


_Dutch Sauce for Fish._

BOIL for five minutes, with a gill and a half of vinegar, a little
scraped horseradish; then strain it, and when it is cold add to it the
yolks of two raw eggs, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a dessert
spoonful of flour and water, and a little salt. Whisk the ingredients
over a fire till the mixture almost boils, and serve it up directly to
prevent it from curdling.


_Anchovie Sauce for Fish._

PUT half a pound of fresh butter into a stewpan, add to it three
spoonfuls of anchovie liquor, walnut and mushroom ketchups a spoonful of
each, the juice of half a lemon, a little cayenne pepper, a tea spoonful
of india soy if approved, a sufficient quantity of flour and water to
make it of a proper thickness. Make the mixture boil, and skim it clean.


_Observations in respect of Fish Sauces, &c._

LET it be particularly observed that fish sauces should be of the
thickness of light batter, so that it might adhere to the fish when
dressed, it being a frequent error that they are either too thick or too
thin. The thickening should be made with the best white flour sifted,
and some water, mixed smooth with a wooden spoon or a whisk, and to be
of the consistence of light batter also. A little of it is recommended
to be always ready where there is much cooking, as it is frequently
wanted both in fish and other sauces.

There are, likewise, other articles repeatedly wanted for the use of
stovework; and as their possession has been found to obviate much
inconvenience and trouble, they are here enumerated: that is to say,
liquid of colour preserved in a bottle, strained lemon juice preserved
in the same manner, cayenne pepper, ground spices, ground pepper and
salt mixed, which should be preserved separately in small jars; and
every day, when wanted, fresh breadcrumbs rubbed through a hair sieve;
parsley, thymes, eschallots, savoy, marjoram, and lemon peel, chopped
very fine, and put on a dish in separate partitions.

Directions are not given for serving the fish sauces with any particular
kind of fish,--such as turbot or salmon with lobster sauce, &c. but the
receipts have been written only for the making them; therefore it is
recommended that every person make a choice, and not be biassed
altogether by custom.


_Apple Sauce for Pork, Geese, &c._

PARE, quarter, and core, baking apples; put them into a stewpan, add a
bit of lemon rind, a small stick of cinnamon, a few cloves, and a small
quantity of water. Cover the pan close, set it over a moderate fire, and
when the apples are tender take the peel and spices out; then add a bit
of fresh butter, and sugar to the palate.


_Green Sauce for Ducklings or Green Geese._

PICK green spinach or sorrel, wash it, and bruise it in a marble mortar,
and strain the liquor through a tamis cloth. To a gill of the juice add
a little loaf sugar, the yolk of a raw egg, and a spoonful of vinegar;
if spinach juice, then put one ounce of fresh butter, and whisk all
together over a fire till it begins to boil.

N. B. Should the sauce be made of spinach juice instead of vinegar,
there may be put two table spoonfuls of the pulp of gooseberries rubbed
through a hair sieve.


_Fennel Sauce for Mackarel._

PICK green fennel, mint, and parsley, a little of each; wash, boil them
till tender, drain and press them, chop them fine, add melted butter,
and serve up the sauce immediately, for should the herbs be mixed with
the butter any length of time before it is served up, they will be
discoloured. The same observation should be noticed in making parsley
and butter sauce.


_Bread Sauce, for Turkies, Game, &c._

SOAK a piece of crumb of bread with half a pint of milk or cream, add a
peeled middling-sized onion, and put them over a fire; when the milk is
absorbed bruise the bread, mix with it two ounces of fresh butter, a
little white pepper, and salt; and when it is to be served up take out
the onion.


_Melted Butter._

IN order to prevent butter from oiling, the flour and water that may be
sufficient for the quantity of butter should be made boiling, skimmed
clean, and the butter added to dissolve, being careful it is of a proper
thickness.

In the same manner may be made fish sauces, adding the liquor of the
lobsters or oysters, &c. with flour and water, and when boiling add the
butter with the other ingredients.


_To make Melon Citron._

TAKE middling-sized melons when half ripe, cut them in quarters, take
away the seed, and lay the melons in salt and water for three days. Have
ready a thin syrup; then drain and wipe dry the quarters, put them into
the sugar, and let them simmer a quarter of an hour; the next day boil
them up again, and so on for three days; then take them out, and add to
the syrup some mountain wine, a little brandy, and more sugar; clarify
it, and boil it nearly to a candied height, put the melons into it and
boil them five minutes; then put them in glasses, and cover them close
with bladder and leather.


_Rusks, or Tops and Bottoms._

TAKE two eggs beat up, add them to a pint of good mild yest and a little
milk. Sift four pounds of best white flour, and set a sponge with the
above ingredients; then make boiling half a pound of fresh butter and
some milk, a sufficient quantity to make the sponge the stiffness of
common dough. Let it lay in the kneading trough till well risen; then
mould and make it into the form of loaves of the bigness of small
teacups; after which batch them flat, bake them in a moderate oven, and
when nearly done take them out, cut the top from the bottom, and dry
them till of a nice colour on tin plates in the oven.


_Wafers._

TAKE a table spoonful of orange flower water, a table spoonful of flour,
the same of good cream, sifted sugar to the palate, and a dessert
spoonful of syrup of cinnamon; beat all the ingredients together for
twenty minutes; then make the wafer tongs hot, and pour a little batter
just sufficient to cover the irons; bake them over a slow fire, and when
taken from the tongs roll them round, and preserve them in a dry place.


_Cracknels._

TO half a pound of best white flour sifted add half a pound of sifted
loaf sugar, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, two table spoonfuls of
rose water, a little salt, the yolks and whites of three eggs beat up,
and mix all well together for twenty minutes. Then roll it out, cut it
into what shapes you please with a pastry cutter, put them on baking
plates rubbed with butter, wash the tops of the paste with whites of
eggs well beaten, and bake them in a brisk oven.


_To bake Pears._

TO a pint of water add the juice of three seville oranges, cinnamon,
cloves, and mace, a small quantity of each, a bit of lemon peel, and
boil them together a quarter of an hour; then strain and add to the

and simmer the ham till three parts done; then add two quarts of water
and boil it till tender, strain it through a fine sieve, skim it
perfectly free from fat, clear it with whites of eggs, strain it through
a tamis, boil it till it is reduced to a pint, and when cold put it into
small bottles and cork them close.


_Ox Heart roasted._

LET the heart be very fresh, wash and wipe it, fill it with a stuffing
as for a fillet of veal, tie over the top a piece of veal caul, roast
it gently one hour and an half, and five minutes before it is done roast
it quick, froth it with flour and butter, and put it on a very hot dish.
Serve it up with a sauce under it made with cullis, fresh butter, a
table spoonful of ketchup, and half a gill of red port boiled together.


_Slices of Cod fried with Oysters._

EGG, breadcrumb, and fry in boiling lard, some slices of crimped cod;
when done, drain them dry, serve them up with oyster sauce in the
center, made in the same manner as for beef steaks.


_Small Crusts to be eaten with Cheese or Wine after Dinner._

TAKE the crumb of a new-baked loaf, pull it into small pieces, put them
on a baking plate, and set them in a moderately heated oven till they
are of a nice brown colour.


_Devilled Almonds._

BLANCH half a pound of jordan almonds and wipe them dry; then put into a
frying-pan two ounces of fresh butter, make it hot, add the almonds, fry
them gently till of a good brown colour, drain them on a hair sieve,
strew over cayenne pepper and some salt, and serve them up hot.


_Boiled Tripe and Onions._

CUT a prepared double of tripe into slips, then peel and boil some
spanish or other onions in milk and water with a little salt, and when
they are nearly done add the tripe and boil it gently ten minutes. Serve
it to table with the onions and a little of the liquor in a tureen.
Serve up, likewise, in a sauceboat, some melted butter with a little
mustard mixed with it, and (if approved) there may be added a table
spoonful of vinegar.


_Boiled Sweetbreads._

BLANCH two heart sweetbreads, wash and trim off the pipe, then boil them
in milk and water with a little salt for half an hour; drain them dry,
and when they are to be served to table put over them some boiling
benshamelle with a little parsley chopped very fine in it.


_Broiled Sweetbreads._

BLANCH the sweetbreads till half done, wash and trim off the pipe, then
cut them into large slices, season with a small quantity of cayenne
pepper and salt, broil them gently over a clear fire till of a nice
brown colour, and serve them up very hot, with some cold fresh butter on
a plate.


_Conclusion, with Remarks._

ALL sweets, pastry, shellfish or savoury dishes, either plain or
modelled, with fat or butter, or ornaments of any kind, that are served
up in second courses or ball suppers, &c. should be very light, airy,
and neat; the pastry, likewise, of the best puff paste, well-baked, and
rather inclining to a pale colour, which has a very good effect.

Let it also be observed, that mention should have been made in the
receipt for Mock Turtle, of an addition to the passing of flour and
butter, to each gallon of liquor half a pint of madeira wine; and (if
approved) the mock turtle may be made with pieces of cow-heel or pig's
head instead of calf's scalp.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
