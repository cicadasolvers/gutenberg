  "Come Jane," said grandmamma one day,
  "'Tis time you learned to sew;
  At your age I could make a frock,
  And you should also know."

  But Jane cared little for such things;
  She liked to make a noise;
  She used to run about all day,
  And shout, and play with boys.

[Illustration]

  So now she only tossed her head
  And ran with eager feet,
  And soon was racing up and down,
  And playing in the street.

  Once Jane was to a party asked;
  Her friends would all be there;
  She wore her best sprigged muslin frock,
  And ribbons tied her hair.

[Illustration]

  When she was shown upstairs to lay
  Her hat upon the bed,
  She saw a little basket there,
  With needles, wax and thread.

  "I wonder," said untidy Jane,
  "If Mattie likes to sew;
  I'm glad that I have never learned;
  I should not care to know."

[Illustration]

  With that she laughed and ran downstairs,
  But on the way--ah see!
  She's caught her skirt upon a nail
  And torn it terribly.

  If Jane had learned from grandmamma
  She might have mended it,
  But she had been a thoughtless child
  And could not sew a bit.

[Illustration]

  So with her frock all torn, into
  The room she had to go,
  And all the children wondering stared
  To see her looking so;

  Then when Jane played it caught her feet
  And almost made her fall;
  That shamed her so she ran away
  And tried to hide from all.

[Illustration]

  When nurse at last was sent for her,
  How glad was little Jane;
  She almost thought she never wished
  To romp or play again.

  "Oh! grandmamma, dear grandmamma,
  Indeed, indeed," said she,
  "If now you'll teach me how to sew
  A thankful child I'll be."




BOISTEROUS ANN

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


  A noisy boisterous child was Ann,
  And very far from good;
  She did not play the pleasant games
  That little children should;
  With rumpled hair and dresses torn
  She came home every day;
  In vain mamma said, "Ann, pray learn
  To be less rude at play."

[Illustration]

  Now little Ann came home one time
  In a most piteous plight,
  For she had fallen in the mud;
  Indeed she was a sight.
  The housemaid standing in the door
  Exclaimed, "What child is this?"
  "Why, Hannah, can't you see I'm Ann?"
  Cried out the little miss.

[Illustration]

  "Our little Ann in rags and dirt,
  Her hair all out of curl;
  No, no," cried Hannah; "run away,
  You little beggar girl.
  If it is scraps of bread you want
  Go to the kitchen door;
  I can't believe you're any child
  I ever saw before."

[Illustration]

  Now Ann has to the kitchen run
  With tears and streaming eyes;
  "Oh, dear cook, please to let me in:
  I'm little Ann," she cries.
  "What little Ann?" the good cook says;
  "Indeed that cannot be.
  Our Ann would never wear such rags
  I'm very sure; not she!"

[Illustration]

  But as Ann, weeping, turned away,
  Her little dog ran out,
  And he began to lick her hands,
  And bark and jump about.
  "Why, why," cried cook, "I never saw
  Dog Towzer act that way,
  Except when little Ann came home
  From school or after play."

[Illustration]

  "And now I look again," she said,
  "You are our little Ann.
  Come in and wash and mend your frock,
  As quickly as you can."
  Now from that day the little miss
  Has played less boisterous plays,
  And been more tidy in her dress
  And quiet in her ways.




THE BROTHER AND SISTER

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


  Their mother bids them run and play,
  But not to wander far away.

[Illustration]

  "Quick," Gretel cries, "let's catch that hare
  Among the bushes over there."

[Illustration]

  The hare now leads them in the chase
  Close by the witch's lurking-place.

[Illustration]

  "No use," she cries "to kick and fight,
  For I will pick your bones to-night."

[Illustration]

  The old witch then puts on the pot,
  That she may boil Hans when it's hot.

[Illustration]

  But while she whets her knife outside
  Gretel opens the cage door wide.

[Illustration]

  The children see a barrel near;
  "Quick! into it! The witch is here!"

[Illustration]

  In after them the witch goes too,
  But she is stuck, and can't get through.

[Illustration]

  And now, ker-splash! down in the ditch
  They roll the barrel and the witch.

[Illustration]

  And see! her little girl and boy
  The mother welcomes home with joy.




GEORGIE LIE-A-BED

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


  "Come, come, get up," cried nurse to George;
  "The breakfast table's spread;
  The porridge will be getting cold,
  And you are still in bed."
  George only sighed and turned about,
  And went to sleep once more.
  Now did you ever know of such
  A lazy child before?

[Illustration]

  When little George at last arose
  The sun was overhead;
  He looked about, no clothes he saw;
  "Where can they be?" he said.
  "Nurse, nurse," he cried, "where are my clothes?
  I do not see them here."
  "Why, no," said nurse, "you will not find
  Your clothes to-day, I fear;

[Illustration]

  Some other child has now your suit,
  Because I thought, indeed,
  If you were going to lie in bed,
  Your clothes you would not need.
  But if you really wish to dress
  And go to school, see there,
  The little dress a year ago
  Your sister used to wear."

[Illustration]

  Now how ashamed is little George
  To have to dress like that;
  To have to wear his sister's frock,
  Her ribbons and her hat.
  Now in the street the children point
  And stare as he goes by;
  "Come look at Georgie-Lie-a-Bed,
  How he is dressed," they cry.

[Illustration]

  Now little George is so ashamed
  To have them see him so,
  He turns about and home he runs
  As fast as he can go.
  "Oh, mother dear," he cries, "if I
  May have my clothes once more,
  I'll try to be a better boy
  Than I have been before."

[Illustration]

  "Why," says mamma, "since that's the case,
  And you repent, my dear,
  Your little trousers, shirt, and coat--
  Just see--they all are here."
  And since that day mamma and nurse
  Are proud and glad to see
  Their little George can such a prompt
  And early riser be.




[Illustration: Untidy Amanda]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


  A naughty child Amanda was;--
  She would not comb her hair;
  Though it was rough and tangled, too,
  Amanda did not care;
  And when mamma the matted locks
  Would fain have brushed and tied,
  Amanda only pushed away
  Her hand and stamped and cried.

[Illustration]

  But listen now! It chanced one time
  Mamma had gone away.
  Amanda she had left at home
  All by herself that day.
  Then someone rattled at the latch;--
  Amanda heard him there;--
  She heard him shutting fast the door
  And creeping up the stair;--

[Illustration]

  Someone with scissors in his hand,
  And dreadful gleaming eyes;
  "Where is that child who will not comb
  The tangles out?" he cries.
  In vain Amanda shrieks and runs,
  He has her by the hair;
  Snip-snap! the shining scissors go
  And leave her head quite bare.

[Illustration]

  Now when mamma comes home again,
  Ah, what is her surprise
  To see Amanda's naked head
  And note her tearful eyes;
  And now lest she a cold should catch
  A nightcap she must wear,
  And when her locks have grown again
  I'm sure she'll comb her hair.




THE CHILD WHO WOULD NOT GO TO BED

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  "I do not want to go to bed;
  I will not go!" cried naughty Fred.
  But it was growing very late;
  The clock had long ago struck eight,
  And so mamma, impatient grown,
  Went off and left him there alone.
  But hark! Creak, creak! upon the stair;
  It was the sand-man walking there.

[Illustration]

  In through the door he looked, and said,
  "What! Frederick will not go to bed?"
  In vain did Frederick kick and bawl,
  The sand-man would not heed at all;
  He tumbled Fred into his sack,
  And off he bore him on his back;
  Away he went out through the door,
  On, on for many a mile and more.

[Illustration]

  At last the sand-man, weary grown,
  Sat down to rest upon a stone.
  Then Frederick turned himself about,
  And quick he whipped his jack-knife out;
  Ke--scritchy--scritch! He cuts a slit
  And softly clambers out of it.
  And now he runs as quick as thought,
  And soon a heavy stone has brought;

[Illustration]

  He softly slips it in the sack
  That hangs upon the sand-man's back.
  Says clever Fred, "He will not see
  He has a stone instead of me."
  And now the sand-man grunts and sighs,
  And slowly he begins to rise.

[Illustration]

  And Frederick hears him sigh, "Alack,
  How that boy thumps about my back!"
  The stupid sand-man never sees
  Where Frederick crouches on his knees,
  Behind the rock, till out of sight
  The old sand-man has vanished quite.

[Illustration]

  But Fred, a thankful boy is he,
  As home he hastens tearfully.
  And ah his mother! with what joy
  She welcomes home her little boy.
  "Ah always after this," cries Fred,
  "I will be good, and go to bed."




THE BEET

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


  "I will not wash my face I say;
  I will not wash," cried Jane, "to-day."
  In vain mamma said, "What disgrace!
  To go with dirty hands and face."
  Jane only sulked and hung her head,
  And so she crept away to bed.

[Illustration]

  Now when the pleasant morning broke
  In bed the slovenly Jane awoke;
  She woke but could not turn in bed,
  Nor stretch herself, nor raise her head;
  She was a beet with nose and eyes,
  A beet of most enormous size.

[Illustration]

  And in the bed the beet leaves green
  Instead of arms and legs were seen;
  And then in came mamma and nurse;
  They did not know her, which was worse,
  But Jane could hear mamma; she said,
  "Why, why! how came this beet in bed?"

[Illustration]

  And now, by two stout boys, away
  They send the beet to town next day,
  That all the people there may see
  How large a beet can grow to be.
  They put her in a window there,
  Where every one can point and stare.

[Illustration]

  There the poor sloven sits and cries,
  Till beet juice oozes from her eyes;
  But ah! was such sight ever seen?
  The beet juice tears have washed her clean;
  And then, the strangest thing of all,
  As fast and faster still they fall.

[Illustration]

  The beet tears melt her back once more
  Into the child she was before.
  She does not stay to wipe her eyes,
  But home with eager feet she hies.
  "Oh mother, mother dear," cries she,
  "Henceforth a cleaner child I'll be."




THE ROBBER RAT

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


  A kitten once lived all alone
  In a little yellow house;
  It lived on crusts of bread and cheese,
  And now and then a mouse.

[Illustration]

  A robber rat lived in a wood--
  A gloomy wood--close by;
  He had sharp teeth, and a pointed tail.
  And a wicked, restless eye.

[Illustration]

  To the yellow house the rat would come,
  And strike the door--knock! knock!
  The kitten's tail would stand on end,
  It gave him such a shock.

  Then in the rat would boldly march.
  "What have you here?" he'd say;
  And then he would steal the bread and cheese,
  And carry it all away.

[Illustration]

  At last the kitten went to ask
  Advice of some old cat
  Who lived close by, and told her all
  About the robber rat.

  The wise old grey cat scratched her ear;
  "I'll fix this rat," she said;
  So she pulled a night-cap over her ears
  And lay in the kitten's bed.

[Illustration]

  And now in marched the robber rat;
  "What!" cried he, "still in bed!
  Quick, fetch me out what cheese you have,
  And all your scraps of bread."

  "Spit-t-t!" with her claws and gleaming eyes
  The cat sprang out of bed.
  The robber gave one dreadful squeak,
  And then away he fled.

[Illustration]

  The old cat caught him by the tail
  Just as he reached the door,
  But snap! it broke, and out he ran,
  And ne'er was heard of more.

  But for the little kitten,
  He danced about with glee;
  "The wicked rat has fled, has fled;
  Meow, meow!" sang he.




GRANDFATHER STORK

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  A very naughty boy was John;
  He quarreled with his food,
  And would not eat his bread and milk,
  As all good children should.
  It grieved his kind mamma to see
  How thin and thinner grew
  Her little John, in spite of all
  That she could say or do.

[Illustration]

  Above the chimney Father Stork
  Heard all that Johnny said,
  And how each day he pushed away
  The bowl of milk and bread.
  And so it was, when kind mamma
  Had left the house one day,
  In through the kitchen door he came
  And carried John away.

[Illustration]

  Upon the roof the little storks
  Live high up in the sky,
  And far below them in the street
  They hear the folks go by.
  The old stork brings them, in his beak,
  The eels and frogs for food;
  But these he will not let them have
  Unless they're very good.

[Illustration]

  Such things poor Johnny could not eat;
  And as he sat and cried,
  He thought of all the bread and milk
  He used to push aside.
  "If I were only home again,
  I would be good," he said,
  "And never, never turn away
  From wholesome milk and bread."

[Illustration]

  If little John was thin before,
  Now thinner every day
  He grew, until you'd think the wind
  Would carry him away.
  So, when at last he was so lean
  His bones seemed poking through,
  There came a sudden gust of wind,
  And, puff! away he blew.

[Illustration]

  And when it blew him to the street,
  How fast he hurried home!
  And, oh, how glad his mother was
  To see her Johnny come!
  But gladder still she was to find
  That he had grown so good,
  And never now would turn away
  From wholesome simple food.




OLD MOTHER WEBTOES

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  "Oh please mamma," said little Jane,
  "May I go out to play?"
  "No, no," her mother answered her;
  "I fear 'twill rain to-day."

[Illustration]

  "With my umbrella green," said Jane,
  "I will not mind the wet."
  But still mamma replied, "No, no;
  A cold I fear you'd get."

[Illustration]

  But oh, Jane was a naughty girl!
  On her own way intent;
  Soon as mamma had turned away,
  Out in the street she went.
  The streets were wet and lonely;
  No children there at play;
  Only old Mother Webtoes
  The frog abroad that day.

[Illustration]

  Now little Jane she seizes,
  In spite of all her cries,
  And green umbrella, Jane and all,
  Away with her she flies.
  Far, far off in the river,
  Upon a moisty stone,
  Old Webtoes and her children
  Live in a hut alone;

[Illustration]

  And Jane's big green umbrella
  Old Webtoes hides away;
  She makes her sweep, she makes her scrub;
  Jane has no time to play.
  She spreads a bed of rushes,
  Where Jane may sleep at night,
  And wakes her in the morning
  As soon as it is light.

[Illustration]

  "Get up," cries Mother Webtoes;
  "The breakfast you must get."
  "Oh let me stay in bed," says Jane;
  "The floor is cold and wet."
  But Mother Webtoes stamps her foot,
  And makes the child arise;
  But as Jane sobs, behind the door,
  Ah, what is this she spies?

[Illustration]

  It is her green umbrella;
  She sets it now afloat,
  And down the river in it sails,
  As if it were a boat.
  "Oh Mother Webtoes, only look,"
  She hears the young frogs scream;
  "The little girl you brought to us
  Is sailing down the stream."

[Illustration]

  But Jane is quite too far away
  For them to catch her then,
  And when at last she drifts ashore
  She sees her home again.
  She rushes to her mother's arms
  With sobs and streaming eyes--
  "Oh mother, mother dear, forgive
  Your naughty Jane," she cries.




THE RABBIT WITCH

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


  Eliza Ann was far from good;
  She did not act as children should,
  But fought and quarreled so at play
  The boys and girls all ran away.

[Illustration]

  Her mother said, "Take care, my dear,
  The rabbit witch will come, I fear,
  And steal you one of these fine days,
  Unless you learn to mend your ways."

[Illustration]

  But yet Eliza did not heed;
  She was a naughty girl indeed.
  So now the rabbit witch has come,
  And carries her away from home.

[Illustration]

  Down in the marshes far away
  The rabbit's children squeak and play;
  They tease Eliza till she cries,
  And with her apron hides her eyes.

[Illustration]

  When market day comes round again
  The witch locks up her house and then
  She says, "Be careful while you play;--
  Don't lose this child when I'm away."
  Now she has gone Eliza takes
  Her apron and a doll she makes.

[Illustration]

  "Just see this apron-girl," she cries;--
  "Look at it's nose and button eyes."
  And now her frock with belt and fold
  Into another doll is rolled;
  She gives it to the rabbit boy,
  Who squeaks and stamps his foot with joy.

[Illustration]

  "Now," cry the rabbits, "we will play,
  For these girls cannot run away."
  But while they rock their dolls and sing
  The witch brings home her marketing.
  "Where are you children dear," she cries.
  The little rabbit boy replies;--

[Illustration]

  "Here with two girls we play, but one
  Far off, across the fields has run."
  The rabbit witch went hurrying out
  To see what they could be about.
  There no Eliza could she find
  But only clothes she'd left behind.

[Illustration]

  Quick after her the old witch ran;--
  Haste, haste, make haste, Eliza Ann!
  Her own dear home was reached at last;
  The door was shut, the latch made fast.

[Illustration]

  But young Eliza had been taught
  A lesson as her mother thought:
  Henceforth she was so sweet and mild
  All loved to be with such a child.




PETER AND THE OGRESS

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


  These small boys started off for school
  But loitered by the way,
  Until at last 'twas quite too late
  To go to school that day.
  Ah naughty, naughty, truant boys!
  But listen what befell!
  Close by a wicked ogress lived,
  Down in a lonesome dell.

[Illustration]

  Now see her coming down the hill!
  Now see the children run!
  Her arms are long, her hands are strong,
  She catches every one.
  In vain the children kick and scream,
  The ogress takes them home
  And locks the door; then off she goes
  To bid the neighbors come.

[Illustration]

  But clever Peter sees above
  The chimney, black and wide;
  "Quick, wipe your eyes and come," he cries;
  "I've found a place to hide."
  And none too soon, for scarce the last
  Is out of sight before
  They hear the wicked ogress
  Come stumping in the door.

[Illustration]

  Then from the chimney Peter bawls,
  "We're hiding, stupid face!"
  "Oh, oh!" the ogress says, "I know;
  You're up the chimney place."
  So up the chimney now she looks;
  "I'll fetch you out," she cries;
  But puff! the clever Peter blows
  The soot down in her eyes.

[Illustration]

  All filled with black out through the door
  She hurries, howling still,
  Just when the other ogresses
  Are coming up the hill.
  They stop, they stare, they quake with fear,
  They stand appalled to see
  This dreadful, hopping, howling thing
  As black as black can be.

[Illustration]

  And now pell-mell away they run;
  But down the chimney place
  The boys climb ere the ogress
  Can clean her sooty face;
  And when they're safely home again
  They keep the master's rule,
  And never, never play again
  At truant from the school.

Transcriber's Note

   The word "nightcap" is spelled with and without a hyphen in the
   text. Both spellings appear to have been in common use and have
   not been altered.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
