A BROWN STUDY IN AUTUMN TINTS.

(_Being a Fragment from a Matter-of-fact Romance._)

And he walked along the deserted streets and could see no one. Here
and there would be a pile of stones and wooden blocks, telling of
an impeded thoroughfare, but the place itself was empty. There were
seemingly no inhabitants in this deserted city. They had vanished into
thin, or, rather, murky air.

Then he looked at what appeared to be a playhouse. The doors were
closed, and the bill-boards were pasted over with blue paper.
Evidently the portals of the theatre had not been open for weeks,
perchance for months.

And it was the same in the parks. Only the leaves moved, and then only
when the wind agitated them. There were a few sparrows in the trees,
but they seemed to be ashamed of themselves, and chirruped (so to
speak) with bated breath. Oh it was indeed a scene of desolation.

And the shops, too! Many of them were closed, and those which were
open seemed to be tenantless. There were no customers; no counter
attendants. Trade seemed to be as dead as the proverbial door-nail.

And the hoardings too! Even they had suffered. Old posters, manifestly
out of date, fluttered in tatters; it had been no one's business to
restore the rotting paper, and it had gone the way of other grass. The
placards were worse than useless; they could not be deciphered.

And yet again he marched on. There were exhibitions, and no one to see
them; museums, and no visitors to inspect them; and churches, and
no one to fill them. At length he came upon a guardian of the public
peace who was lazily gazing into the sluggish river over the parapet
of an embankment.

"Good sir," said he, "can you tell me if this dreadful, lonely,
deserted place is the City of the Dead?"

"Go along with you!" cried the policeman, good-humouredly; "it's only
London in September!"

And then he felt that he had been deceived by appearances!

History Repeats Itself Again.

    ["The alleged unemployed who assemble on Tower Hill are
    becoming worse even than mountebanks. One of the speakers
    declared yesterday that 'The secret societies of London are
    going to-night to wait on Mr. GLADSTONE, to ask what he is
    going to do. If the PRIME MINISTER does not give a definite
    reply, they will take him on their backs and throw him into
    the Thames.'"--_The Daily Telegraph, Sept. 1._]

  The _genius loci_ haunts
    Historic Tower Hill,
  For, judging by their vaunts,
    Men lose their heads there still.

    making Directors liable in respect of misconduct or neglect

    reading."--_Daily Paper._]

  'Twas Ruin! And the Small Invest-

  "Beware the Jabezwock, my Lord!
    The jaws that bite, the claws that dig;
  Beware the Hobbs-hobbs bird, and shun
    The saintly Guinea-pig!"

  The Peer set out, his Bill in hand;
    He had to be extremely leary
  In tackling such an artful foe,
    Whose weapon was _Suppressio Veri_!

  And as he mused o'er blighted lives,
    The Jabezwock, as yet unfloored,
  Came snuffling piously to join
    A meeting of its Board.

  One, two! One, two! And through and through
    All stages passed the Bill like winking;
  And this is what the Peers just then
    Most probably were thinking:--

  "And have we scotched the Jabezwock,
    And spoiled him of his false Prospectus!
  O frabjous day! What Rad will say
    That from this House he'd now eject us?"

  Will miss this good, sage, gentle priest;

_NOUS_ AND NERVES.

    [It is said by some of his friends that Dr. CHARCOT, lately
    dead, who spent a considerable part of his life in the study
    of neurosis, found this disease everywhere at last, especially
    in the naturalistic school of French writers.]

          If this Neurosis,
          As some suppose, is
  The _causa causans_ of Naturalism,
          The spring ubiquitous
          Of aught iniquitous
  That puts 'twixt genius and sense a schism;
          Then must we pray
          For the dawn of a day
  When the Glorious Gift that the world so serves
          May cut chlorosis,
          And shun neurosis;
  In fact, that Genius may have no "nerves."

[Illustration: _Master John Bull._ "JUST YOU WAIT TWO OR THREE YEARS,
TILL I MAKE HER SWIM,--THEN _I'LL_ SHOW YOU!"]

    [Sir EDWARD REED said that with the armoured citadel intact,
    and an unarmoured end destroyed, the ship is in imminent
    danger of upsetting. The _Victoria_ was bound to capsize with
    the injury she received. There were other ships that were
    equally bound to capsize, when they were injured in the same
    manner; the reason being that instead of the armed citadel
    being the major part of the structure, and the unarmoured ends
    the minor portion, we had chosen to make the unarmoured ends
    the major part, measuring more than half the entire length of
    the ship. The ships likely to capsize in a similar manner,
    if they received like injury in peace or in action, were
    the _Agamemnon_, _Ajax_, _Anson_, _Benbow_, _Camperdown_,
    _Collingwood_, _Colossus_, _Edinburgh_, _Howe_, _Inflexible_,
    _Rodney_, and _Sans Pareil_.]

AIR--"_Hearts of Oak._"

  Come, cheer up, my lads! 'tis to Davy we steer!
  (We add to his Locker 'bout one ship per year.)
  To capsizing we call you in cheeriest staves,
  For what is so certain as death 'neath the waves?
              Iron coffins our ships,
              Death-doomed tars are our men.
                Our ships are unsteady!
                Ready, aye ready!
          We'll sink or turn turtle again and again!

  We ne'er see our ships (for which millions they pay),
  The _Ajax_, the _Anson_, and such, but we say,
  "Will they ram, or capsize, or but run slap ashore?
  When we go to the bottom JOHN BULL must--build more!"
              Iron coffins our ships, &c.

  Our _Camperdowns_, _Collingwoods_, _Rodneys_, _Benbows_,
  REED says are all "dangerous"--_not_ to our foes!
  If struck in their unarmoured ends they turn o'er,
  And go to the bottom! How DAVY must roar!
              Iron coffins our ships, &c.

  The Frenchy and Rooshian must laugh as they look,
  And see JOHN BULL trying, by hook or by crook,
  To get his tin-kettles to keep right side up,
  Agin touch of a ram, agin tap of a Krupp!
              Iron coffins our ships, &c.

  "Just wait two or three years," grumbles JOHN, "and _I'll_ show,
  _If my ships will but swim_, I can still whop the foe.
  Stop a bit--whilst my big-wigs build, blunder, debate!"
  Ah! that's all mighty fine, but, my JOHN, _will_ they wait?
              Iron coffins our ships, &c.

  Britannia triumphant we all wish to see,
  Quite equal to two foreign fleets, perhaps three;
  So cheer up, my hearties, and banish your fears!
  They will build us a ship as _will_ float--in three years!

(_Meanwhile, my lads, "chorus as before," if you please, until further
orders from our Naval Oracles!_)

              Iron, coffins our ships,
              DAVY'S wictims our men;
                In wessels unsteady,
                We're ready, aye ready,
          To sink or turn turtle again and again!

LETTERS FOR THE SILLY SEASON.

(_Apparently intended for some of our Contemporaries._)

SIR,--Of course I do not wish to be frivolous, but do you not think
that "_lovely_," "_too sweet_," "_quite too darling_," and other
expressions in italics are miss-used words? At any rate, they are
constantly in the mouths of my daughters and nieces.

  Yours truly,
  PATERFAMILIAS.

SIR,--I give a list of misused words that have occurred to me during
a month on the Continent. I put the words I consider inappropriately
applied in italics. Paris is _inexpensive_, Boulogne is _beautiful_,
Cologne is _inodorous_, German cookery is _good_, 'ARRY on his travels
is _pleasant_, garlic is _agreeable_, hotel charges in Italy
are _moderate_, railway travelling in Belgium is _expeditious_,
washing-basins in Swiss hotels are _large_, a rough passage across the
Channel is _delightful_, and the Continent is _like_ home.

I could extend the list indefinitely, but have written enough to show
how imperfect the English language really is to convey accurately
one's most ordinary ideas. I may add that when I have used and not
misused words, I have been told that I have no right to swear--so what
_can_ I do?

  Yours truly,
  COMMON SENSE.

SIR,--I am glad to see that there is a correspondence upon misused
words. However, I can say that such words as "excellent," "admirable,"
"wonderful," "splendid," and "glorious," are _not_ misused when
applied to ----.* Thanking you in advance,

  I remain, yours truly,
  PUFF PUFF.

(_A Story in Scenes._)

[Illustration: "How shall I ever tell Cornelia?"]

SCENE I.--_A decorously-furnished Drawing-room, at Hornbeam Lodge,
Clapham, the residence of_ THEOPHILUS TOOVEY, Esq. _It is Sunday
evening._ Mr. TOOVEY, _an elderly Gentleman with a high forehead,
a rabbit mouth, and a long but somewhat wispy beard, is discovered
sitting alone with a suitable book, upon which he is endeavouring to
fix his thoughts, apparently without success._

_Mr. Toovey (reading)._ "With what a mixture of indescribable emotions
did I find myself actually standing upon the very brink ----" (_To
himself, as he puts the volume down_) It's no use, I can't concentrate
my mind on Palestine to-night, I can't forget this horrible
"Eldorado." Ever since I got that official warrant, or demand, or
whatever it was, yesterday, I've been haunted by the name. It seems
to meet me everywhere; even on the very hoardings! Why, _why_ didn't I
invest Aunt ELIZA'S legacy in consols, as CORNELIA told me, instead
of putting it into a gold-mine? I think LARKINS said it was a
_gold_-mine. If only I had never met him that day last year--but he
seemed to think he was doing me such a favour in letting me have some
of his shares at all; he'd been allotted more than he wanted, he told
me, and he was so confident the Company was going to be a success that
I--and now, after hearing nothing all this time, I'm suddenly called
upon to pay a hundred and seventy-five pounds, and that's only for one
half year, as far as I can make out.... How can I draw a cheque for
all that without CORNELIA finding out? I never dared tell her, and she
overlooks all my accounts. Why did I, who have never been a follower
after Mammon, fall so easily into that accursed mine? I am no business
man. All the time I was a partner in that floorcloth factory, I
never interfered in the conduct of it, beyond signing my name
occasionally--which was all they allowed me to do--and they took the
earliest opportunity of buying me out. And yet I must needs go
and speculate with Aunt ELIZA'S five hundred pounds, and--what is
worse--lose every penny, and more! I, a Churchwarden, looked up to by
every member of an Evangelical congregation, the head of a household
like this!... How shall I ever tell CORNELIA? And yet I must--I never
had a secret from her in my life. I shall know no peace till I have
confessed all. I _will_ confess--this very night--when we are alone.
If I could speak to CHARLES first, or to that young Mr. CURPHEW--they
will both be here to supper--and CHARLES is in a Solicitor's office.
But my nephew is too young, and Mr. CURPHEW, though he _is_ a
journalist, is wise and serious beyond his years--and if, as CORNELIA
thinks, he is beginning to feel a tenderness for ALTHEA, why, it might
cause him to reconsider his---- No, I can't tell anyone but my wife.
(_Sounds are heard in the hall._) There they are!--they are back from
Church--already! (_He catches up his book._) I must try to be calm.
She must not notice anything at present!

_Mrs. T. (outside)._ I've left my things downstairs, PH[OE]BE; you can
take them up to my room. (_Entering._) Well, Pa, I hope you feel less
poorly than you did, after your quiet evening at home?

_Mr. T. (flurried)._ Yes, my love, yes. I--I've had a peaceful time
with _Peregrinations in Palestine_. A--a most absorbing book, my love.

_Mrs. T._ You would find it more absorbing, Pa, if you held it the
right way up. You've been asleep!

_Mr. T._ No, indeed, I only wish I--that is--I may have dropped off
for a moment.

_Charles (who has followed his Aunt)._ You wouldn't have had much
chance of doing that if you'd been at Church, Uncle!

_Mrs. T._ No, indeed. Mr. POWLES preached a most awakening discourse,
which I am glad to find CHARLES appreciated.

_Charles._ I meant the cushion in your pew, Uncle; you ought to have
it restuffed. It's like sitting on a bag of mixed biscuits!

_Mrs. T._ We do not go to Church to be _comfortable_, CHARLES. Pa,
Mr. POWLES alluded very powerfully, from the pulpit, to the recent
commercial disasters, and the sinfulness of speculation in professing
Christians. I wish you could have heard him.

_Mr. T. (squirming)._ A--a deprivation indeed, my love. But I was
better at home--better at home.

_Mrs. T._ You will have other opportunities; he announces a course of
weekday addresses, at the Mission Rooms, on "The Thin End of the Wedge
of Achan." CHARLES, I gave you one of the circulars to carry for me.
Where is it?

_Charles._ In my overcoat, I think, Aunt. Shall I go and get it?

[ALTHEA _enters_.

_Mrs. T._ Not now; I haven't my spectacles by me. THEA, did you tell
PH[OE]BE to pack your trunk the first thing to-morrow?

_Althea._ Yes, Mamma; but there is plenty of time. CECILIA doesn't
expect me till the afternoon.

_Charles._ So THEA's going up to town for a few days' spree, eh, Aunt
CORNELIA?

_Mrs. T. (severely)._ Your cousin is going on a visit to a married
schoolfellow, who is her senior by two or three years, and who, I
understand, was the most exemplary pupil Miss PRUINS ever had. I have
no doubt Mrs. MERRIDEW will take ALTHEA to such entertainments as are
fit and proper for her--picture-galleries, museums, concerts, possibly
a lecture--but I should not describe that myself as a "spree."

_Charles._ No more should I, Aunt, not by any means.

_Mrs. T._ I never met this Mrs. MERRIDEW, but I was favourably
impressed by the way she wrote. A very sensible letter.

_Alth. (to herself)._ Except the postscript. But I didn't like to show
Mamma that!

_Charles._ But you'll go to a theatre or two, or a dance, or
something, while you're with her, won't you?

[ALTHEA _tries to signal to him to be silent_.

_Mrs. T._ CHARLES, you forget where you are. A daughter of ours
set foot in a playhouse! Surely you know your Uncle's objection to
anything in the nature of a theatrical entertainment? Did he not
write and threaten to resign the Vice-Presidency of the Lower Clapham
Athenaeum at the mere hint of a performance of scenes from some play by
that dissolute writer SHERIDAN--even without costumes and scenery? His
protest was most admirably worded. I remember I drafted it myself.

_Mr. T. (with some complacency)._ Yes, yes, I've always been extremely
firm on that subject, and also on the dangers of dancing--indeed,
I have almost succeeded in putting an entire stop to the children
dancing to piano-organs in the streets of this neighbourhood--a most
reprehensible custom!

_Mrs. T._ Yes, THEOPHILIUS, and you might have stopped it long before
you did, if you had taken my suggestion earlier. I hope I am not
to infer, from your manner, that you are yourself addicted to these
so-called pleasures, CHARLES?

_Charles._ Dancing in the street to a piano-organ, Aunt? Never did
such a thing in my life!

_Mrs. T._ That was not my meaning, CHARLES, as you very well know.
I hope you employ your evenings in improving your knowledge of your
profession. I should be sorry to think you frequented theatres.

_Charles (demurely)._ Theatres? rather not, Aunt, never go near 'em.
(_To himself._) Catch me going where I can't smoke! (_Aloud._)
You see, when a fellow has lodgings in a nice cheerful street in
Bloomsbury, it isn't likely he'd want to turn out of an evening after
sticking hard at the office all day!

_Mrs. T._ I am glad to hear you say so, CHARLES. It is quite a mistake
for a young man to think he cannot do without amusement. Your Uncle
never thought of amusing himself when he was young--or our married
life would not be what it is. And look at Mr. CURPHEW, who is coming
in to supper to-night, see how hard _he_ works--up to town every
afternoon, and not back till long after midnight. [_The bell rings._

_Charles._ Rather queer hours to work, Aunt. Are you sure he doesn't
go up just to read the paper?

_Althea (with a slight flush)._ He goes up to _write_ it, CHARLES. Mr.
CURPHEW is on the press, and has taken rooms here for the air of the
Common. And--and he is very clever, and works very hard indeed; you
can see that from his looks.

_Ph[oe]be (announcing)._ Mr. CURPHEW.

[_A tall slim young man enters, with a pale, smooth-shaven face, and
rather melancholy eyes, which light up as he greets_ ALTHEA.

_Mrs. T._ How do you do, Mr. CURPHEW? You are a little late--but some
services last longer than others. Oh, PH[OE]BE, now I think of it,
just bring me a paper you will find in one of the pockets of Mr.
COLLIMORE'S overcoat; it's hanging up in the hall--the drab one with
grey velvet on the collar. (PH[OE]BE _goes_.) It's a circular, Mr.
CURPHEW, which was given out in our Church this evening, and may
interest you to see.

_Ph[oe]be (returning)._ If you please, m'm, this is the only paper I
could find.

_Mrs. T. (taking it from the salver, without looking at it)._ Quite
right, PH[OE]BE--we shall be ready for supper when I ring. (_When_
PH[OE]BE _has gone_.) I can't see anything without my---- ALTHEA, just
go and see if I have left my spectacle-case in my room, my dear. It's
astonishing how they're always getting mislaid, and I'm so helpless
without them. (ALTHEA _goes_.) Mr. CURPHEW, perhaps you will read this
aloud for me; I want my husband to hear.

_Curphew (suppressing a slight start)._ May I ask if they distribute
papers of this sort at your Church--and--and why you think it is
likely to interest me in particular? (_To himself._) Wonder if this

COPHETUA, L.C.C.

Mr. GRANT ALLEN charges London with being "a squalid village." Sir
LEPEL GRIFFIN suggests that the "Postprandial Philosopher" must have
been dining badly. He--Sir LEPEL--contends that "Like the beggar-maid
in Mr. BURNE-JONES'S picture, London is a beautiful woman, fair of
face and noble of form, and only needs the transforming hand of some
future King COPHETUA to strip her of her sordid rags, and clothe her
in the lustrous raiment which befits her." This is what 'ARRY would
call "the straight Griffin"! By all means make COPHETUA Chairman of
the London County Council--as soon as you find him! Sir LEPEL, instead
of joining in the parrot-chorus of disparagement, actually says, "The
best hope of the regeneration of London is in the County Council"!!!
He thinks "it is a mistake" to distrust them, and would hand over to
them (says the _Daily Chronicle_) most of the machinery and material
of our municipal life. Quite so. And as the Gryphon (which is much the
same thing as Griffin) said to the Mock Turtle (suggestive this of the
Civic Corporation), in _Alice in Wonderland_, _Punch_ would say to Sir
LEPEL or his problematic COPHETUA, "Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all
day about it!"

When ALICE ventured to say she had never heard of "Uglification," the
Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. "What! Never heard
of uglifying!" it exclaimed. "You know what to beautify is,
I suppose?"--"Yes," said ALICE, doubtfully; "it
means--to--make--anything--prettier."--"Well, then," the GRYPHON (who
must have been a Postprandial Philosopher, surely) went on, "if you
don't know what to uglify is, you _must_ be a simpleton."

By the way, why should not Sir LEPEL himself essay the _role_ of
King COPHETUA, L.C.C., and help to beautify the modern Babylonian
beggar-maid? He says that "the general administration of London is
infinitely mean and inefficient," adding that "vested interests are
chiefly to blame for the national disgrace." Very well. Let Sir LEPEL
help to give those same Vested Interests "vun in the veskit," squelch
the Jerry Builder, and arrest the march of "Uglification," and
then--why then London will, as in duty bound, erect _his_ statue in
place, and on the site of, that other, and very different "Griffin,"
which is the very incarnation of Uglification, and material embodiment
of B[oe]otian Bumbledom!

LITTLE BILL-EE.

(_Latest House of Lords' Version of Thackeray's Song._)

  There were three sailors of London City,
    Who took a boat and went to sea:
  There was guzzling BOB and gorging HARTY,
    And the youngest--he was Little BILL-EE!

  Poor Little BILL-EE was but a sailor-boy,
    And a very hard time in sooth had he.
  With a rope's-end he was fully familiar,
    And a marline-spike he shuddered to see.

  He had sailed in the ship of one Captain WILLYUM.
    Who had taught him sailing, and algebree,
  The use of the sextant, and navigation,
    Likewise the hornpipe, and fiddle-de-dee.

  The Captain's pet for a long, long voyage
    Had been this sailor-boy Little BILL-EE;
  Though some of the crew of the same were jealous,
    And larruped him sore--on the strict Q.T.

  But being paid off from WILLYUM'S wessel,
    The kid was kidnapped, and taken to sea
  By guzzling BOB and gorging HARTY,
    Who had long had their eye on poor Little BILL-EE.

  For guzzling BOB hated Captain WILLYUM,
    While gorging HARTY--well, there, you see,
  _He_'d been WILLYUM'S mate, but had cut the connection,
    And he couldn't abide poor Little BILL-EE.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Poor Little BILL-EE, he shrank and shuddered
    At going aboard; for he says, says he--
  "When they get me aloft they will spifflicate me,
    And there'll be an end of poor little BILL-EE!"

  Which same seemed a sad foregone conclusion,
    Though Captain WILLYUM he skipped with glee,
  And cried, "Little BILL-EE, keep up your pecker!
    You shall yet be the Captain of a Seventy-three!"

       *       *       *       *       *

  Now, to keep up your pecker with naught to peck at
    Is mighty hard, as a fool may see;
  And BOB and HARTY (who loved not short commons)
    Cast eager eyes upon Little BILL-EE.

  Says guzzling BOB to gorging HARTY,
    "I am extremely hungaree;"
  To guzzling BOB says gorging HARTY,
    "Let's make a breakfast of Little BILL-EE.

  "He's got no friends--that are worth the mention;
    He'll never be missed by his countaree,
  He is a noosance, he'll be a riddance,
    And we'll both get thanked for devouring he."

  To guzzling BOB says gorging HARTY,
    "On this here pint we both agree--
  This precious Bill _must_ be spifflicated,
    And we're both hungry, so let's eat he!"

       *       *       *       *       *

  "Oh, BILL-EE! we're going to kill and eat you,
    So undo the button of your chemie!"
  When BILL received this information,
    He used his pocket-handkerchie.

  First let me say my Apologia,
    Which Capting WILLYUM taught to me!
  "Make haste, make haste!" says gorging HARTY,
    While BOB pulled out his snickersee.

       *       *       *       *       *

  It's "a norrible tale," and I scarce feel equal
    To telling it all as 'twas told to me.
  Some other day you may learn the sequel
    Of the sorrowful story of Little BILL-EE!

TRUE FRENCH POLITENESS.

(_A Conversation not entirely Imaginary in Siamese Territory._)

SCENE--_A Palace. Present, a swarthy_ Sovereign _and Smiling_
Negociator.

_Negociator._ Sorry to trouble you again, your Majesty, but there are
just a few supplementary matters that require settlement.

_Sovereign._ Why, surely your ultimatum has deprived me of everything?

_Neg._ Oh, dear no! For instance, you have foreign advisers.

_Sov._ And I presume I may act upon their advice?

_Neg._ Well, yes; only it will be necessary to send them back to
Europe, and then stop their letters.

_Sov._ But this will be exceedingly arbitrary treatment.

_Neg._ Do you think so? Well, at any rate it will be better than a
bombardment of your capital.

_Sov._ Have you any other demand to make?

_Neg._ Scarcely worth mentioning. But we must insist that in future
all work must be given to artisans of our nationality.

_Sov._ And every other kind of contract?

_Neg._ That follows as a natural sequence.

_Sov._ Would you like anything more?

_Neg._ Not only like, but insist upon having it. You must surrender
your forts, disband your army, and dispose of your fleet.

_Sov._ Come, that's impossible!

_Neg._ Not at all. It is a course I would strongly recommend if you
want to keep your throne, and your subjects desire to preserve their
lives.

_Sov._ Can you suggest anything else?

_Neg._ We never suggest. We order. Well, yes, you will do nothing
without our approval, or it will be the worse for you.

_Sov._ Why, this is absolute bullying!

_Neg._ Pray don't say that, your Majesty. Although I speak plainly, I
wish to treat you with every respect.

_Sov._ But if you have left me nothing, I may as well abdicate in your
favour. Shall I?

NEG. You will do as you like, your Majesty. My instructions are to
treat your will as law. I have no wish to control your actions, as I
accept you as the constitutional sovereign of an independent state.
Do what you please, and what pleases you will please me also. My
instructions are to give you entire freedom of action--so long as that
freedom chimes in with our requirements!

AN OLD "ADELPHI TRIUMPH!"

Passing through town from one country place to another. Sparse
attendance at club. Am regarded with surprise by the few members
present, all anxious to explain why it is they are not out of London.
"Autumn Session" splendid excuse for everybody generally. "Compelled
to stop in town, dear boy. Autumn Session, dash it!" "But you're not
in the House." "No," is the ready rejoinder, "if I were I would 'pair'
and fly to the moors. But business connected with the House" (this
given with that mysterious nod and wink which together, or apart, are
accounted as equally intelligible to a blind horse), "business, my
dear chap, detains me." Great chance for the club bore to get an
audience of one. The Ancient Mariner's time is in the dead season,
when he can stop the shootist _en route._ I am wary, and avoid him.
I will dine earlyish, and go to--let me see, what hospitable house
of theatrical entertainment is open? The Adelphi. Here I can see _A
Woman's Revenge_, as written by HENRY PETTITT. Quite so. Dine at 6.30,
and see it all out, as I hear the final scene, an Old Bailey Trial,
realistic to the last degree, is the great attraction. Clearly to
understand the pleadings on behalf of the prisoner at the Bar I must
be conversant with the details of the entire story. By 8.10 I am in
my seat, regretting the loss of ten minutes' worth of the plot. Regret
soon ceases on finding that I am among old friends acting a story more
or less familiar to every playgoer. The house is literally crowded in
every part, and this, too, on a far from cold night at the very end of
August. Town may be empty, but the Adelphi is full, and "The Heavenly
Twins," the Messrs. GATTI, must be rejoicing greatly.

For a cool, calm, calculating villain, recommend me to Mr. CHARLES
CARTWRIGHT, the very best of gentlemanly scoundrels of modern
melodrama. He is admirable: but directly the honest, outspoken Adelphi
audience nose his villainy he has a bad time of it, as no matter what
he may say or do, no matter whether he speaks slowly or quickly, runs
off, saunters off, lounges in or hurries in, he is at once met, and so
to speak "countered," by a storm of fiercely indignant hisses. Surely
an actor whose _role_ is sheer villainy of the deepest dye must be
able to command enormous terms, seeing what a long training it must
require to arrive at taking cursing for compliments! An Adelphi
audience personally hate and detest the stage villain, but for all
that, they couldn't do without him, any more than can the melodramatic
author or the Messrs. GATTI.

After _the_ villain, who certainly holds the first place in popular
unpopularity, comes the Heroic Boy, CHARLES WARNER, all heartiness and
simplicity, a very "bounding Achilles;" and next to him, the suffering
heroine who defends herself with a revolver, who is finally charged
with murder, and gallantly defended by the Heroic Boy, who, attired in
wig, gown, and bands, appears in the last scene of all that ends this
eventful his'tory as Counsel for the Defence, pleading for his
wife before a full court, much less crowded than is the Old Bailey
generally, and apparently far loftier, and much better ventilated. The
case does not attract considerable public attention, as there is only
a sparse attendance of nobodies in the gallery. Throughout the drama
Mr. GARDINER and Miss FANNY BROUGH capitally represent the comic
interest, which is brightly written, and "goes" uncommonly well.

The other scoundrel is only young in his villainy--a mere amateur as
compared with Mr. CHARLES CARTWRIGHT, and were it not for the things
he does and says, he might at any moment be taken for a comedian
neither light nor eccentric, but a fairly all-round and superior
sort of "CHARLES his friend," whose lines fall in pleasant places as
feeders. Poor Junior Scoundrel! from the first he has no chance of
appearing either gay or light-hearted, as he is invariably at the
mercy of the Senior Rascal, and is finally shot by his own revolver
which, after being used against him on several occasions, for the poor
Junior Rascal never has a chance with it himself, falls into the hands
of aforementioned Senior Rascal, and so he goes to his dramatic grave
without having had one solitary opportunity of making a light and airy
speech, or doing anything to bring down the house. He comes in for his
share of the hissing, poor fellow! as does also Miss ALMA STANLEY, in
the costume of a kind of Madame Mephistopheles--a female villain of
the deepest scarlet and black dye. She, too, is one of the trio only
created to be hooted at by an enthusiastically virtuous public. This
monster of female depravity, however, is not a bad sort, and shows
some signs of repentance--a repentance not too late, though it is
deferred till 10.50, when it just comes in time to assist the plot and
unite two loving hearts.

There is a clever child in the story; far and away the best child
I remember to have seen, since the child in _A Man's Shadow_ at the
Haymarket, who also figured in a trial and gave evidence against a
father (or mother, I forget which). There was another wise child who
did much the same sort of thing and got its own father convicted in
_Proof_, also at the Adelphi. As to the trial scene (which seems to
lack SULLIVAN'S setting of GILBERT'S words), it seemed to me that Mr.
WARNER was counsel, witnesses, prosecutor, and defender, all in one,
and, even considering the peculiar circumstances of the case, anyone,
from a purely professional point of view, would be inclined to blame
the presiding judge, Mr. HOWARD RUSSELL, for such an exhibition of
Job-like patience, and for his quite unexampled toleration of an
advocate's irregularities. However, his summing up was a model of
conciseness and brevity, as it took for granted the jury's perfect
knowledge of facts and law, and its delivery occupied just about
a couple of minutes. Had Mr. WARNER been the judge, and Mr. HOWARD
RUSSELL the counsel, the above-mentioned allotment of time would,
probably, have been reversed. The jury, an intelligent-looking set
of men, utterly belied their appearance by acquitting the prisoner in
face of the most damning circumstantial evidence. But as it was
close on ten minutes past eleven, and as the author had provided no
sensational incident to follow, and had given no Fifth Act to finish
with, the decision of the Jury was much applauded by the crowded
audience in the auditorium, which then began to clear out, highly
satisfied with the excellent bill of fare provided for them by
Messieurs GATTI, the worthy restaurateurs of the old Adelphi Drama.

JOHN BULL'S NAVAL VADE MECUM.

(_Prepared for his use by the Authorities at the Admiralty._)

_Question._ Does not England possess the best possible fleet?

_Answer._ Certainly, and always has enjoyed that advantage.

_Q._ But do not the iron-clads comprising this fleet frequently turn
turtle?

_A._ Assuredly. In fact, whenever they have the smallest opportunity.

_Q._ And do not the guns with which the ships are armed occasionally
burst?

_A._ Not only occasionally, but frequently.

_Q._ And are not the commanders of the fleet sometimes guilty of
errors of judgment?

_A._ To be sure, and sometimes these errors of judgment lead to
absolute disaster.

_Q._ And are not the ships considerably undermanned and some of the
companies of inferior material?

_A._ Quite so. In fact, when there is a special strain--man[oe]uvres
on a large scale, or for a kindred reason--crews have to be obtained
from here, there, and everywhere.

_Q._ And is it not quite a question whether some dozen of our
first-rate men-of-war are practically valueless?

_A._ Well, scarcely a question, because it is all but certain that
they are practically valueless.

_Q._ And isn't there bullying in the _Britannia_, and a general laxity
in the training of young officers to take important commands?

_A._ Yes, but this is a matter of small importance, as all naval
officers are merely machines, and have no right to think or act on
their own responsibility.

_Q._ And does not a commander-in-chief sometimes make a grave
and obvious mistake, and do not all his subordinates, knowing the
consequences, implicitly obey him?

_A._ Of course, for this is the rule of the service.

_Q._ And is it not a fact that the navy is in want of the appliances
to repair ships that have suffered damage abroad?

_A._ Assuredly.

_Q._ And is not our officers' acquaintance with the characteristics of
the sea rather indefinite and distinctly limited?

_A._ It is bound to be with defective charts and other false guides to
naval knowledge.

_Q._ Then may it be justly assumed that we cannot count upon our
ships, guns, and commanders?

_A._ Why, certainly.

_Q._ And yet you declare that England possesses the best possible
fleet?

_A._ I do, and the little drawbacks I have admitted have no force in
qualifying the assertion.

_Q._ Why have they not?

_A._ Because all the drawbacks exist in the piping times of peace, and
consequently the British navy will prove its superiority in the more
dangerous days of war.

NEW KING COAL CORRECTED.

In the sub-heading of _Mr. Punch's_ Up-to-Date Nursery Rhyme, "New
King COAL" (August 19, p. 74), a very obvious error was made in
speaking of the colliers of Northumberland and Durham as "on strike,"
when in fact they were only "considering the advisability" of joining
their Welsh "brothers" and Midland "mates" in a collective stand
against the coal-owners. Since then, _Mr. Punch_ is glad to know, they
have "thought better of it," and have _not_ joined the strike--having,
perhaps, given "thoughtful consideration" to _Mr. Punch's_ friendly
conundrum. "The bearings" of the New Nursery Rhyme "lie in its
application," and are not altered by the writer's slip of the pen, to
which, however, _Mr. Punch_ thanks various vigilant readers for, very
properly, calling his attention.

  To the men's Federation 'twas _Punchius_ spoke:
  "The Capitalist can drink fizz and can smoke;
  And why should a lad who has eyes and can see,

Always blameless. To-night blushing, since Mr. G., accidentally as

[Illustration: DOOMED!] Piled them up on either side of him. "In
laager," as UGHTRED SHUTTLEWORTH ruefully said, glancing across the
table at his adversary.

[Illustration: Bowles as the Walrus.]

"Have looked forward to this day with keen anticipation," said TOMMY.
"Have dropped a word in season occasionally in debate on Home-Rule
Bill, I admit. But it's to Committee of Supply I have looked forward
for full opportunity of serving my QUEEN and country. Now here we
are in Supply, and here we rest for a week or two. I feel like the
Walrus."

"How's that?" I asked, fearing for a moment that much talking had made
TOMMY mad.

"Don't you remember? Haven't you been _Through a Looking-Glass?_

  'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
    'To talk of many things:
  Of shoes, and sticks, and sealing-wax,
    Of cabbages, and kings.
  And why the sea is boiling hot--
    And whether pigs have wings.'

You bet that somewhere in the icy north that Walrus had been
accustomed to sit on the Opposition benches in Committee of Supply.
Couldn't otherwise have so accurately described situation."

_Business done._--In Committee of Supply.

_Tuesday._--BURNIE burning with curiosity to know whether 'tis true,
as boldly rumoured, that Duke of CONNAUGHT has been appointed to
chief command of Army at Aldershot? If so, on what grounds?
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN with strategic brevity answered that appointment
had been made in accordance with principle of selection of the
fittest. House, moderately full at moment, received the explanation
with much less enthusiasm than might have been expected. This
encouraged gentlemen below gangway to persist in divers enquiries
designed to illustrate, and perchance establish, C.-B.'s position.
ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS joined in hunt; particularly anxious to know what
experience in real fighting the new Commander had enjoyed? "He was
in command of brigade in Egyptian expedition," said C.-B., making an
involuntary sword-pass at ALPHEUS.

"Yes," persisted that matter-of-fact person; "but will the right hon.
gentleman tell us how near or how far away from the real fighting the
Duke of CONNAUGHT stood?"

No authentic record being in archives of War Office, SECRETARY OF
STATE declined to commit himself to reply. Later, in Committee,
ALPHEUS staggered Civil Lord of the Admiralty with enquiry as to
steam-launch built at Portsmouth dockyard for Duke of CONNAUGHT "at
the expense of the people." "What has become of that launch?" ALPHEUS
asked, fixing ROBERTSON with gleaming eye, as if he suspected he might
have it concealed somewhere about his person. ROBERTSON tremblingly
answered that he knew nothing about it. ALPHEUS not by any means
mollified; means to bring up whole subject in Committee on Army
Estimates.

_Business done._--Over four millions voted on Navy Estimates by some
twenty or thirty Members representing House of Commons.

_Wednesday._--Mr. G. made fine speech to-day, moving Third Reading of
Home-Rule Bill. Benefited immensely by compression; only an hour long;
but full of meat and matter. Long grown accustomed to these supreme
efforts of Perennial Youth. A series this Session which, in respect of
eloquence, vitality, and force, will stand comparison with any equal
number delivered in what was (erroneously it now turns out) regarded
as his prime.

More interesting as an episode was the reappearance on the
Parliamentary stage of a DISRAELI. CONINGSBY has sat in House for full
Session; wisely abstained from imprudence of young Member of to-day,
who takes the oath at four o'clock and catches the SPEAKER'S eye
at ten. Now, in these closing days of Session, on seventy-ninth day
debate Home-Rule Bill, CONINGSBY modestly thinks "the time has come
when they _shall_ hear me."

House did so with pleasure. Only a small gathering. Mr. G. absent,
which was a pity. On the 7th of December, 1837, Mr. G., sitting on
back bench on Conservative side, lifted up "a fine head of jet-black
hair, always carefully parted from the crown downward to his brow," to
listen to an earlier maiden speech delivered by an elderly young man,
"ringed and curled like an Assyrian bull," his violet velvet waistcoat
garlanded with gold chains. Across the bridge of fifty-six years a
marvellous memory might have recalled this figure had the ex-Member
for Newark to-day been in his place to look across the House at
the dapper young man, with quiet self-possessed manner, who, having
considered this Government Bill, had come to the conclusion that it
is "a measure born in deceit, nurtured in concealment, swaddled in the
gag, and thrust upon the country without the sanction of the people."
The old Disraelian ring about that phrase. House sees again D'ISRAELI
the Younger; only Younger than ever. But that is a reproach CONINGSBY
may outlive.

_Business done._--Third Reading of Home-Rule Bill moved.

_Saturday_, 1.30 A.M.--Eighty-second day of debate on Home-Rule Bill.
After being "gagged" through all those days and nights of ruthless
talk, a House crowded on every Bench, filling galleries and thronging
Bar, opens wide its mouth and cheers announcement that Third Reading
been carried by 301 votes against 267. When House is unanimous,
its unanimity wonderful. Everybody agreed to shout for
joy--Ministerialists because majority was 34, Opposition because it
isn't 38.

"Thank you, TOBY," said Mr. G., when I congratulated him on the end
of the long job; "I expect we're all glad it's over. Excuse me, but I
just want to drop the Bill in the post for the Lords."

[Illustration: Finished at Last!]

Crowd waiting outside Palace Yard caught sight of him as he tripped
along. A ringing cheer woke echoes of the stilly night; Mr. G.
escorted home in triumph to Downing Street.

"Dear me!" said the Member for SARK. "Now I wonder how many of those
who are now cheering Mr. G. helped fifteen years ago to break his
windows?"

The Member for Sark always thinks of cheerful things.

_Business done._--Home-Rule Bill read Third Time.

       *       *       *       *       *

GOING TO THE COUNTRY.

(_By another Sporting M.P._)

  We have talked and divided and sat till we're ill,
    At the mercy of every pestiferous bore.
  It's a WILDE kind of thing to be saying, but still
    Now like _Oliver Twist_ we keep "asking for moor."

  There are some who think politics naught but a game
    'Twixt the Ins and the Outs that is played in the House,
  But the game that we sigh for (and are we to blame?)
    Is the covey of partridge or moor-loving grouse.

  Now we're well in September, and work nearly finished,
    I'm off, whilst the Commons get lost in the bogs
  Of Supply and stay on with their zeal undiminished,
    For the Country may go--like myself--to the dogs!

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
