PAINTING WITH LIGHT
THE YEAR'S PROGRESS
HOW WE MAKE OUR PHOTOGRAPHS





PAINTING WITH LIGHT


_By _ARTHUR WESLEY DOW
_Professor of Fine Arts in Teachers College, Columbia University_

The painter need not always paint with brushes, he can paint with light
itself.  Modern photography has brought light under control and made it as
truly art-material as pigment or clay.  The old etchers turned chemical
action to the service of Art.  The modern photographer does the same,
using the mysterious forces of nature as agents in making his thoughts
visible.  It's a long story of effort and experiment since someone
observed that an inverted landscape on the wall of a darkened room was
painted by light coming through a hole in a shutter.  The shutter and the
dark room are still acting, but now we can hold the fleeting vision.
While we rejoice in the triumph of Science it is the triumph of Art that
concerns us most.  The photographer has demonstrated that his work need
not be mechanical imitation.  He can control the quality of his lines, the
spacing of his masses, the depth of his tones and the harmony of his
gradations.  He can eliminate detail, keeping only the significant. More
than this, he can reveal the secrets of personality.  What is this but
Art?

Just here we must remember that neither light, nor chemicals, nor camera,
nor nature tell us anything of Art--that Art is not the child of Knowledge
or Science or Nature, but is born of trained Appreciation in the soul of
man.  He that would paint with light must be first of all a Designer.  His
chief concern will be to find and use his own powers of choice and
appreciation. He will need the studio more than the laboratory.

"What is Design?" Ask Korin, Hiroshige, Giotto, Rembrandt, Titian; ask the
master-photographers who can build harmonies of line and space and
texture.  But the secret is not revealed by asking, only by DOING.





THE YEAR'S PROGRESS


_By _CLARENCE H. WHITE


                   _An Interview with Henry Hoyt Moore_


"What notable events, Mr. White, have occurred in the photographic world
during the year 1920?"

"Perhaps no outstanding event, either on the art side or the scientific
aspect of photography, has marked the year.  A steady progress, however,
in the direction of a better appreciation of photographic art is apparent.
This is seen, for one thing, in the numerous exhibitions that have been
held.   Confining our attention to American exhibitions, I would remark
that instead of, as in former years, having one big exhibition in
Baltimore or Philadelphia or some other city, there are now active centers
all over the country--there is a regularly established international salon
in Los Angeles, and the well-known Pittsburgh Salon, and regularly
established exhibitions in Portland and Toronto.  There are groups of
enthusiastic workers in all these centers.  There are also exhibitions of
photographic art regularly held in many of the museums of the country."




                   AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHERS SET THE PACE


"I once heard a well-known photographic worker say, 'If you have any doubt
as to the pictorial quality of a photograph, send it to the London Salon
and their judgment will decide for you.'  Is this still true?"

"I still feel that the American photographers set the pace, and in this
connection I would like to read you this letter from the Secretary of the
Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain as indicating the appreciation
in England of American pictorial work:



    35 Russell Square, London, September, 1920.

    I am happy to say that we have received from the United States and
    Canada a collection of pictorial photographs of such outstanding
    interest that the task of discrimination became one of great
    difficulty.

    Those selected by the judges have been placed in the exhibition,
    but the Council of the Society feel that it would be most
    unfortunate if the collection generally could not be viewed by the
    English public, and it is proposed that the bulk of the American
    and Canadian pictures, including those shown at the Annual
    Exhibition, should form one of our house exhibitions and be open
    to the public during the last part of January and the beginning of
    February, 1921.

                                              J. MCINTOSH, _Secretary_




                           THE SOFT FOCUS LENS


"What changes in the past twenty years, Mr. White, would you say have been
most noticeable in photographic work?"

"Well, I would say the most noticeable is what we call the use of the soft
focus lens.  Secondly, I would say another noticeable change is the better
general quality of photographic work.  I feel that the photographers of
today have a better idea of picture construction."

"Would you say that one of the changes in the past twenty years is in the
spreading of a knowledge of pictorial photography throughout the country?"

"Very definitely so.  The interest in pictorial photography twenty years
ago was confined to a small group.  There are now groups in various
centers as large as the national group of the early days."




                        NO ONE LENS IS SUFFICIENT


"Getting down to a practical question for a moment, Mr. White, do you
recommend a soft focus lens for small cameras, the work to be enlarged
with a sharp lens, or do you recommend the reverse process?"

"I still keep to my original statement that I made two or three years ago
that I do not believe that any one lens will serve all purposes.  I
sometimes feel that an anastigmat lens is best and sometimes that a soft
focus lens is best for some particular work, and sometimes I feel that if
I could get only one I would prefer an anastigmat to a soft focus."




                    SOFTNESS DESIRABLE, NOT FUZZINESS


"Is there a tendency, as shown in the work seen in the magazines, the
exhibitions, and the photographs selected for the present _Annual_, to get
rid of fuzziness and substitute a rational degree of softness and
atmospheric effect?"

"I would say that the reproductions that we see in the magazines do not in
all cases represent lens work but, I fear, bad printing sometimes.  There
is often a good definite quality in soft focus lens work that looks very
definite indeed, even more definite than a sharp lens will give.
Fuzziness is bad, but not softness.  The soft focus lens seems to be more
popular than ever and it apparently has come to stay."




     PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY INFLUENCED BY THAT OF THE PICTORIALIST


"Has the professional photography of today been influenced, in your
judgment, by the work of the pictorialists?"

"Yes, very decidedly, and the professionals confess it.  The best
professional photographers freely admit that they have drawn much
inspiration from the pictorial workers' ideas."




                           THE POPULAR MEDIUMS


"What medium--gum, multiple gum, bromoil, platinum, bromide, chloride--is
most popular today?"

"Bromide and chloride are the most popular.  That this is so is probably
because they are easier to use; but there are very earnest workers--some of
the best--who insist on using the processes which give a greater range and
greater possibilities of quality, such as bromoil, gum, and gum platinum.
I would say that these processes are more popular than they used to be."




                            COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY


"Has color photography made any advance during the year?  Are autochromes
still popular?  Has any progress been made in the direction of producing
color photography on paper?"

"I do not know of any special progress in this branch of the art.  Color
photography on paper has been worked out successfully by Mr. Ives, and I
think the difficulty in obtaining materials has temporarily affected the
popularity of color photography in this country."

"Is the color process used to any extent for portraiture in the United
States?"

"I do not think it is used to any great extent, but I believe that it has
great possibilities and that it can be used if workers will take the
necessary care and pains.  I think the difficulty of getting material
recently has set things back along this line."




                        THE "SECRET" IS THE ARTIST


"Have the so-called pictorial photographers any 'secrets?'  People often
ask, 'How are these effects produced?'  What is the best method of
producing soft, atmospheric pictures?  Can a skilled worker take an
ordinary hard negative and, by suitable manipulation or the use of soft
paper, produce an atmospheric print?  Is the medium the secret?  Will one
paper or developer produce soot and whitewash effects and another a
picture?  Are soft effects generally produced by manipulation in
developing negatives or prints?"

"I believe the quality of a picture is not due to the medium by which it
was made.  It depends entirely on the man who made it.  I think one man
can make a good print on soft paper and another a good print on hard
paper.  I do not think the medium makes the picture.  I think the medium
produces the picture to some extent, but it does not make the picture."




                      HAND WORK VS. STRAIGHT PRINTS


"What are the limits of hand work that are legitimate in photography?  I
don't like to use the word faking, but most people would so describe it.
I mean, for instance, putting in skies, blocking out obtrusive
backgrounds, sunning down high lights, retouching negatives, printing
through prepared masks that entirely alter the negative, and pencil or air
brush work on prints?"

"I do not have any objection to anybody using any methods that he pleases
providing that the result is convincing; and I believe that practically
every one of these means has been used successfully, in making pictures.
On the other hand, some of the best and probably more good pictures have
been produced by not using any of them--that is, by making the picture
straight."




               COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES FOR PICTORIAL WORK


"Are there commercial possibilities at present for pictorial
photographers?  Has the public shown an increasing desire to buy soft
focus pictures?  Is there a demand on the part of magazines and newspapers
for pictorial work?"

"There is a very definite demand on the part of both magazines and
newspapers for soft focus pictures.  In fact, sometimes the art editors,
in their eagerness to get soft focus work, will buy a photograph because
it is fuzzy, without regard to its quality.  But the outlook for the
pictorial worker in its financial possibilities is steadily improving."




                           AIRPLANE PHOTOGRAPHY


"Has any pictorial work been done in connection with airplane photography?
Is the apparatus for this sort of work too expensive for anything besides
military or movie use?"

"At present I do not know personally of any pictorial work being done in
this direction, but I have seen reproductions in newspapers of pictures
from airplanes that show most interesting results.  Airplane photographers
as a rule do not as yet put into their work a marked pictorial quality."




                 ELABORATE APPARATUS NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY


"Have any notable inventions marked the year?  Is the photostat coming
into use and has it any value other than commercial?  Do you recommend one
of the new high-priced enlarging cameras, which focus the lens
automatically on any size of paper, as suitable for clubs to purchase?"

"Well, I must confess that I have only heard of it, and the price seems to
be such as to discourage almost all the pictorial workers that I know.  In
my observation of the work that has been done by pictorialists, the very
fact that in many instances they use makeshift apparatus has resulted in
some of the most beautiful effects in their work.  Good apparatus is of
course desirable, but there are happy accidents with the other sort.  It
is the workman, not his tools, that counts.  Get the best tools if you can
afford them, but remember that you can make just as bad pictures with an
expensive outfit as you can with the cheapest."




                    HOW MR. WHITE JUDGES A PHOTOGRAPH


"Many persons would like to know, Mr. White, what are the criteria used by
advanced workers like yourself in judging a photograph.  Do you allow so
many points for composition, for technique, for originality of conception,
or for success in a difficult medium?  Or do you say, 'That picture
pleases me, and I vote for it,' without attempting to state in
mathematical form the qualities of its success as a picture?"

"I would say that the first thing a man should do in judging pictures is
to answer the appeal of the picture.  I think a picture should have a
message--that is, it should convey, not necessarily a story, but something
of the feeling of the man who produced it.  This is really a difficult
question to answer.  I would say, 'That picture pleases me and I vote for
it.'  That is to say, so many points for technique and so many points for
pictorial quality would mean nothing to me.  I would insist that a picture
have an appeal, and then that it have good construction, and it should
have quality.  The printing medium, as I have said, doesn't make the
picture, but the man who uses it."




                 MOTION PICTURES AND THE SOFT FOCUS LENS


"Probably photography's greatest activity at present is in the motion
picture field. Have soft focus lenses been used for producing screen plays
and with what result?"

"Soft focus lenses are being used in motion picture photography, but I am
doubtful as to their success in the way they are being used at present--a
somewhat haphazard way.  You are too conscious of the soft focus lens and
of the anastigmatic lens.  That is, one part of the picture is made with a
soft focus lens and one with an anastigmatic.  I believe that the soft
focus lens can be used, and will be used, in such a way as to give
beautiful results on the screen."




             IS PHOTOGRAPHY TO REMAIN A BLACK AND WHITE ART?


"What forecast, Mr.White, do you make of future developments in
photography?  Is it to remain a black and white art, or are photographs in
natural colors to supersede the familiar photograph of the present day in
our exhibitions and in our homes?"

"I think that the fundamental expression of photography is in black and
white, and as we develop what I would call the definite photographic
quality, black and white will maintain its present ascendency."

"But don't you expect the art to develop in different directions from what
it is today and what it has been in the past?"

"I think it will develop especially in a more marked sense of picture
construction."

HOW WE MAKE OUR PHOTOGRAPHS


 _Methods of Several Representative Workers in Pictorial Photography Are
     Given Below. Their Pictures May Be Found on the Pages Indicated_




DR. CHAFFEE TELLS HOW HE MAKES BROMOILS--WITH RESERVATIONS


_See __Weissthurm_

Rothenburg o. Tauber, today a mediaeval town surrounded by its ancient
walls and towers, possesses relics of yet earlier fortifications within
the present ones. One of these relics is the so-called Weissthurm, still
dominating the narrow streets that lead to it and the old houses that have
attached themselves to its base.

The print is a bromoil transfer upon English crayon paper from Wellington
smooth ordinary (pre-war variety).  The negative was made with a Goerz
Dagor lens in a Lancaster reflex upon a Seed Ortho L plate.  The further
data which all careful workers are supposed to keep were not made and can
there fore unfortunately not be furnished.

                                                            A. D. CHAFFEE.




                  EVADED THE STATUTE, BUT MADE A PICTURE


_See __Cables_

"Cables" is the pictorial result of several months' study of the Brooklyn
Bridge towers.  When I found the composition I wanted, the rest was easy.
Except for the police.  To a Bridge policeman anything on a tripod is a
movie camera, and that means: "Some guy's gonna jump!  Where's he at?" I
evaded, not the law, but the majesty thereof--and with an 8x10 view camera.

The light was bad. (My lens would give an optical savant brain fever; I
designed it myself.)  I used the rising front to the limit, and stopped
down to F:11 to cover the plate.  Result, under-exposure, at one-sixtieth.
I developed first in Rodinal, 1:120; then finished in Rodinal 1:30.
Stanley plates can endure much cruelty.  The print for reproduction is
made on matte Azo, soft, using strong M.-Q. developer.

                                                        ARTHUR D. CHAPMAN.




                   A FEW BELIEFS OF A NEGATIVE TENDENCY


_See __The Bugle Call_

I believe that the data of camera, plate, lens, exposure, paper, etc.,
have no essential value as aids in pictorial photography.

That pictures are made with the camera by feeling alone.  The selection of
the subject, the lighting, the composition, the exposure and development,
and the after-treatment and selection of the printing medium, are all a
matter of feeling.

That the rules of technique once learned are all practically violated in
the making of the plate and in the production of a print, according as the
artist feels his subject and as he wishes to reproduce that feeling.

In that way only can the individuality be attained which is the keynote of
picture-making.

                                                          DWIGHT A. DAVIS.




                       PHOTOGRAPHING ON A RAINY DAY


_See __Maids o' the Mist_

This picture was made with a vest pocket kodak fitted with a Goerz Dagor F
6.3.  It was a rainy day and the camera user made his exposure under an
umbrella.  The film was enlarged to 61/2x81/2 on Illingworth De Luxe paper,
cream-colored stock, imported from England--took about three months to get
it.

                                                  MR. AND MRS. J. D. DREW.




                        HOW A "REMBRANDT" WAS MADE


_See __My Father_

The original negative of my father was made with 5x7 Graphic camera and a
Standard Orthonon plate, using a Busch Omnar F 4.5 of ten-inch focal
length, at full opening.  A hazy day in the country, the ground covered
with snow, a south window shaded by a veranda and my father seated in
front of the window about four or five feet from it, explain the lighting.
No reflector was used.  Camera was moved to get the desired light.
Knowing him, I caught him in a favorite chair and in a characteristic
position.  To subdue the detail of the door and wall behind, but to
suggest the depth and atmosphere of the room and to give all the lines and
modeling of the face, an enlargement was made on an 11x14 sheet of P. M.
C. No. 8 Bromide paper, and this was carefully inked, using the copper
sulphate, salt, bichromate bleach.  The aim throughout was to get a print
which should be a sympathetic record of a good strong face and one which
should tell of the cheerful evening of a busy life.

All my portraits are made in ordinary living-rooms or school-rooms. I
rarely use any reflector, merely shifting my camera or my subject,
preferably the former.  For younger subjects and especially children I
prefer a lighter key.  Sometimes I use a soft focus lens for a very
moderate degree of diffusion.

                                                          VERNON E. DUROE.




                         HE THOUGHT SHE WAS CRAZY


_See __Arches of the Municipal Building_

"Arches of the Municipal Building of New York" was taken on a Standard
Orthonon plate, about 9:30 A.M., with a twenty minute exposure.  Instead
of a lens, the photographer used a piece of black paper pierced with a
pin.  A wise passer-by who knew a thing or two about photography noticed
the absence of the lens.  "How do you think you are going to take a
picture without a lens?" he asked. "With a pin-hole," she replied.  He

                      THE LAST OF THE SQUARE RIGGERS


_See __The Last of the Square Riggers_

How to suggest something of the stately vigor and the triumph over the
mysteries of the seas of the old whaler, "Greyhound," home from her last
voyage after seventy-four years of service--her yards squared and bravely
dressed for the inspection which will condemn her to be broken up--was the
problem of the photographer.

The time was near noonday in early August, the air clear and the sun
bright.  A Graflex camera was used with Seed L Ortho plates and a
three-times screen, and one-fortieth of a second exposure sufficed at F 8.
The plate was developed with Kalogen in tank rather softly and a contact
positive made of the negative.  This positive was then used to make an
11x14 negative by enlargement.  P. M. C. No. 8 paper, buff stock, was
selected, and in printing a piece of thin, even-grained paper was placed
between the negative and the print paper to gain a certain softness of
quality in the finished print.   Finally when dry the print was waxed and
rubbed down several times to give extra life and richness, particularly in
the shadows.  The camera carried a nine-inch Struss lens.

Answering your question, Do you like to work with the Graflex with a Smith
doublet, visual quality lens?  I really believe it would be difficult to
find a more satisfactory outfit.  It is a companion always ready and
willing to do everything that either comes your way or you go after.
Working at F 4.5, the lens gives you the opportunity of getting the
broadest effects in landscapes or the softest in portraits.  As a rule
these are not pleasing to most people when enlarged.  I therefore usually
work with the lens at F 6 or F 8, which gives a delightful image with
distinct contours and a definite softness to the outlines, making
beautiful enlargements which are sharp enough for bromoil or gum.  And the
Graflex is not so very heavy when a film pack or cut films are used.  The
image is always right side up and you see it in the full size.  No one can
question the efficiency of the shutter, and with practice you can hold the
camera for a one-fifth second exposure.  The only drawback to the outfit
is in seeing things from the waist level, which makes the foreground
difficult.  Thinking of your picture as a pattern, however, it is better
to be looking down from an elevation and with a nine-inch lens on a 4x5
box the immediate foreground is negligible.  Everything considered, I
believe there is no more satisfactory outfit than this combination.

"Still Life" was the result of a problem of construction in pastel with
three colors, the vase green, the small box red, with the white string.
It was later photographed as a study of colored objects, using a Standard
Orthonon plate with a Cramer Isos III filter and a Struss lens at F 8.
The lens was of fifteen-inch focal length on a 61/2x81/2 plate.  The exposure
was made in an ordinarily lighted room, but not strong light, and I think
about four minutes was given. The print is on ivory black platinum.  There
was no retouching of any kind, and I think the print shows the value of
using a color filter with an orthochromatic plate where colors are
contrasted in the subject.

            MR. LATIMER EXPRESSES HIS VIEWS SOMEWHAT AT LENGTH


_See __In an Italian Village_

In the olden days I used to lug around big cameras. I even went so far as
to have 14x17 _hand camera_, made to take to sea with me to make large
direct marines.  In the days of the old Boston Camera Club it was called
"the dog-house."  But I soon found out that it was "too much pork for a
shilling."  Now I use small cameras and enlarge.  My small cameras are
mostly of the stereo-panoram variety, and a pocket Ansco, all fitted with
fast lenses and with direct vision finders, which I consider much more
practicable than the old style finders.  For instance, I was on a steamer
a few months ago, waiting to leave the dock, and a lot of gulls were
flying around.  I said to myself, "Here's a good opportunity to test my
shutter and finder, and see if I can stop them," so I used up one roll of
film on them.  I made direct hits and stops on every one.

My picture "In an Italian Village" was made with my Voigtlander 45x107 mm.
stereo camera.  I was on an auto trip in Italy; had nearly used up my
three months allowed by the Italian Government, and had three days to get
out or lose my deposit for duty on my car.  I was on my way to the French
frontier, and ran through this Italian village--Todi I think the name was.
When I saw this picturesque old wall with some of the villagers, I said,
"I've got to get this whether I lose my deposit or not."  So I stopped the
car, got out my stereo, stood up in the car, leaned on the windshield, and
shot before they woke up to what I was doing.  Then what happened?  The
whole village seemed to want to get into the plate, and I had a mob
instead of a picture.  I made several more shots, but the first one was
the best.  In nine cases out of ten in like conditions I find the first
shot the best.  Shoot quick and don't give 'em time to pose.  I suppose if
I had trained movie models, though, it might be different.  I've tried
studio work, but I prefer the small camera and the quick snapshot.  Luck
counts, I admit, but when it is good, the snapshot seems to me more
spontaneous than anything I can do in the studio.

My usual method of enlarging from small camera shots is this.  I enlarge a
transparency (positive) up to 61/2x81/2 or 8x10.  "In an Italian Village" was
an 8x10 positive, sharp lens.  Then, either with a soft focus or a sharp
focus lens, I enlarge to whatever size I want and whatever effect I'm
after.  The advantage of enlarging the positive is that you can do any
faking you want to better advantage, and when your enlarged negative is
done you can print in any medium you wish, so I always make enlarged
negatives.  I don't think I've made a bromide enlargement in twenty years.
"In an Italian Village" was enlarged from a part of a 45x107 mm. stereo, a
little larger than my thumb-nail.  The enlarged negative is 11x14.  It was
printed in multiple gum, four printings, pigment 50-50 lampblack and
indigo.

                      NIGHT PICTURES IN THE STREETS

City--Mr. Alcock's picture was made under similar conditions._

Picturing New York with a camera after dark is perhaps one of the most
interesting phases of pictorial photography.  After spending several
evenings prowling about for subjects that will lend themselves for night
pictures you start out one evening to transfer these mental images to the
plate.  A little patience, endurance, and a great deal of enthusiasm will
do wonders.  It is not the easiest thing in the world to start out with an
8x10 view camera, a good substantial tripod, and several plate-holders.  A
strong tripod is absolutely necessary on account of winds, jars,
vibrations, etc.  To avoid halation use portrait film, take the view where
there are no glaring lights, and develop with Azol.  Judge your time
according to the amount of light (two to ten minutes).  Capping the lens
each time a lighted moving vehicle comes along helps the picture.  For
night pictures probably the best medium is gum palladium, because it lends
itself to the mellow evening lights.

                       HOW TO "WORK UP" A NEGATIVE


_See __Along the Canal_

"Along the Canal" was taken about mid-day in July in bright sunlight,
Graflex 4x5, Cooke lens working at one-twentieth of a second, F 11, on
Seed 26x plate, Pyro (Kodak powders) developer.  In working up, first make
Solio print and enlarge by photographing up to 6x8.  On this negative sky
and some trees were painted out, using glass side to work on.  From this
negative print was made on American platinum paper, first the foreground,
then the sky printed from negative which will suit subject.  Retouching
can be done on this print with carbon pencil.  You then have a print which
can be enlarged to any size, using Smith lens.  This print is on Spanish
hand-made paper, hand-coated with platinum.

                  AN EXPERIENCE WITH A RAILWAY DETECTIVE


_See __The Railway Station_

I wandered into the Grand Central Station in New York City with a new
camera--a Speedex 21/4x31/4.  It had been given me as a present by my partner
in photographic and other joys, who was tired of seeing me lug around an
8x10 view camera and plates.  I thought the light looked interesting in
the big station and opened my little box.  Appeared on the scene the
station detective.  "Not allowed to make photographs without a permit."
"Where do I apply for it?"  "At the stationmaster's room."  I walked half
a mile and interviewed a pretty stenographer.  She said, when I showed her
the tiny camera, "Certainly you can make snapshots with that little thing.
What we don't like is putting up a big camera on a tripod."  I went back
in triumph, showed my permit, and shot.  F4.8 Zeiss lens, wide open, one
second exposure.  Enlarged on P. M. C. No. 5, to 11x14 with Smith lens.

                         FROM A "BATHROOM" EXPERT


_See __The Hour of Twilight_

I never at any time have had a regular dark room, practically always
changing my plates and reloading holders at night in total darkness.  When
developing plates or enlargements, I take possession of the bathroom,
place a wide board across the tub on which are placed the necessary trays,
see that the room is absolutely dark, and go ahead.  I usually tank my
plates and films and use Azol for developing, sometimes Pyro.

Most of my exposures are made with an Adams Minex Reflex camera, quarter
plate size.  This camera cost about three hundred dollars before the war,
and I have found it well worth the expenditure.  It has a Ross Zeiss
Tessar lens, which I seldom use, being quite content with the work of my
Smith single F 4.5 lens, which I carry in the camera all the time with a
three-times light filter attached.  My only other camera, which I use a
great deal, is a Newman & Guardia "Baby Sybil" with Carl Zeiss Tessar F
4.5 lens, taking a picture 4.5 x 6 cm.  This does wonderful work, the
negatives easily enlarging to 11x14 and over.  I use the Standard Orthonon
plate and Premo speed film pack, always giving a full exposure.  My
favorite printing processes are multiple gum and bromoil, three or four
printings in the former, nearly always from enlarged paper negatives up to
11x14 from either camera.

"The Hour of Twilight" is a triple printing in gum, and was made with the
Adams Minex on a Standard Orthonon plate, using a Smith single lens.

_See __Sisters_

When I went out of town to make a photograph of these children I wasn't
feeling just fit and I asked my friend to excuse me from making any
negatives that day.  I took the opportunity to look around and get an
impression of the place.  I noted the big rooms and the characteristics of
the lighting and the faces of the children.  I found that they kept their
toys in a big sort of a highboy.  So the next time I went out I
photographed them there.  The lens? Oh, yes; a Taylor-Hobson single.
Exposure?  Always with a cap, indoors.  Paper?  Always platinum or
palladium--sometimes with a gum coating to help out.

                 DRAGGING A VIEW CAMERA THROUGH THE SANDS


_See __Sand Dunes_

For want of a smaller one, I had the courage to drag a 61/2x81/2 Eastman view
camera through the sand one late afternoon in September, to make my
picture of the "Sand Dune."  I used a Struss lens stopped to F 11, a
Standard Orthonon plate, an Iso three-times ray filter, and gave it as
short an exposure as I could with a cap.  I use a cap because I tell
myself it is less mechanical and because I do not happen to possess a
shutter.

I developed the plate with Activol and printed it on sepia Palladiotype to
try to give it that quality of sunlight which I saw falling upon the sand,
the waving dune grass, and the sea beyond.

_THE_ PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHERS _OF_ AMERICA


The objects of the Pictorial Photographers of America are to stimulate and
encourage those engaged and interested in the Art of Photography; to
enlist the aid of museums and public libraries in adding photographic
prints to their departments; to stimulate public taste through
exhibitions, lectures, and publications; to invite exhibits of foreign
work; and generally to promote education in this Art so as to raise the
standards of Photography in the United States of America.

Meetings of the Association are held in New York City on the first Monday
of each month.  During the winter of 1919-1920 the following lecturers
addressed the Association at these meetings: Mr. Robert J. Cole, Art
Reviewer, New York Evening Sun, on "Man and the Camera;" Mr. H. J. Potter,
of the Eastman Kodak Company, on "Both Ways from F-8;" Mr. Albert Sterner,
on "Before the Click of the Shutter;" Mr. Pirie MacDonald and Mr. E. B.
Core, on "The Pictorial Side of Professional Photography;" and Mr. Walter
G. Wolfe, on "The Use of the Soft Focus Lens." Mr. Allen Eaton, Field
Secretary of the American Federation of Arts; Mr. William M. Ivins,
Curator of Prints, Metropolitan Museum of Art; Dr. Frank Weitenkampf, of
the New York Public Library; Prof. Charles H. Farnsworth, of Columbia
University, and Walter L. Hervey, Ph.D., also made addresses.

Another feature of the meetings which added to their interest and
usefulness was a monthly print competition.  Prints were submitted by
members from all parts of the United States, judged by a committee in
advance of the meeting, and a selection of ten prints presented to the
members for their consideration.  From these they chose each month the two
best prints.

The Pictorial Photographers of America this year for the first time
arranged an exhibition of prints in Europe.  Acting on the invitation of
the Copenhagen Photographic Amateur Club to cooperate in celebrating its
Twenty-fifth Anniversary, about 350 prints from leading pictorialists all
over this country were assembled and forwarded in July to Copenhagen.

At home, in cooperation with the American Federation of Arts, the
Pictorial Photographers of America exhibited at the following museums the
hundred prints which are reproduced in "Pictorial Photography in America
for 1920."  The John Herron Art Institute of Indianapolis, The Jackson Art
Association of Michigan, The Boston Society of Arts and Crafts, The
Mechanics Institute of Rochester, The Arnot Art Gallery of Elmira; and
during May, at the University of Virginia.

During the past season the Association has cooperated with other
organizations of a similar nature in planning for and establishing an Art
Center in New York City.  The plans for this have been successfully worked
out, funds are already in hand for its accomplishment and buildings
purchased for occupancy.  This will provide a home for our Association, a
splendid gallery for exhibitions, and thus make certain of immediate
accomplishment plans for our future which have seemed impracticable up to
the present time.

In publishing "Pictorial Photography in America for 1921" the Association
has invited the cooperation of pictorialists whether or not members of the
organization. We hope that it will interest in our work men and women,
whether photographers or not, who are interested in the development of the
Art of Photography. The Secretary will gladly give more detailed
information about the work of the Association and its plans for the coming
year to any who are interested.

this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given away

1.C.

the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying,
distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on
the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of
course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} mission of

charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the

    - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works calculated using the method you
      already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to

      Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60
      days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally

      Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,
      "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation."

      You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License.
      You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the
      works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and
      all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.

      You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
      any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
      receipt of the work.

      You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works.


1.E.9.


If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic
work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this
agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in
Section 3 below.


1.F.


1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.


1.F.2.


LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES -- Except for the "Right of
Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for
damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE
NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH
OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE
FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGE.


1.F.3.


LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND -- If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.


1.F.4.


Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in
paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.


1.F.5.


Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the
exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.


1.F.6.


INDEMNITY -- You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark
owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and
any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution
of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs
and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from
any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of
this or any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, and (c) any Defect
you cause.


Section  2.


           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}'s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

      General Information About Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
