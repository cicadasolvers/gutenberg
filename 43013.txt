  [Illustration: The Bee. The Beet. The Beetle.]

     Good Mr. Darwin once contendeds
     That Beetles were from Bees descended;
     And as my pictures show, I think,
     The Beet must be the missing-link.
     The Sugar-Beet and Honey-Bee
     Supply the Beetle's pedigree:
     The family is now complete,--
     The Bee, the Beetle and the Beet.




  [Illustration: The Ant. The Pheas-ant.]

     The Ant is known by his ant-ennae,
     Where-as the pheas-ant hasn't any,
     And that is why he wears, instead,
     A small red cap upon his head:
     Without his Fez, indeed the pheasant
     Would be quite bald and quite un-Pleasant.




  [Illustration: The Bunny. The Tunny.]

     The superficial naturalists have often been misled,
     By failing to dis-crim-inate between the tail and head:
     It really is unfortunate such carelessness prevails,
     Because the Bunnies have their heads where Tunnies have their
       tails.




  [Illustration: The Eel. The Eelephant.]

     The marked aversion which we feel,
     When in the presence of the Eel,
     Makes many view with consternation,
     The Elephant's front ele-vation.
     Such folly must be clearly due
     To their peculiar point of view.




  [Illustration: The Puss. The Octo-pus.]

     The Octo-pus or Cuttle-fish!
     I'm sure that none of us would wish
     To have him scuttle 'round the house,
     Like puss, when she espies a mouse:
     When you secure your house-hold pet,
     Be very sure you do not get
     The Octo-pus, or there may be
     Dom-es-tic in-_felis_-ity.




  [Illustration: The Gnu. The Newt.]

     The Gnu conspicuously wears
     His coat of gnumerous bristling hairs,
     While, as we see, the modest Newt
     Of such a coat is destitute.
     (I'm only telling this to you,
     And it is strictly "entre gnu".)
     In point of fact the Newt is nude,
     And therefore he does not obtrude,
     But hides in some secluded gnook,
     Beneath the surface of the brook:
     It's almost more than he can bear,
     To slyly take his breath of air,
     His need of which is absolute,
     Because, you see, he is a Pneu-t.[A]

  [A] This stands for air, like aero-static,
      Greek--"pneumos"--air--comp-air "pneu-matic".

  [Illustration]




  [Illustration: The Hare. The Harrier.]

     The Harrier, harassed by the Hare,
     Presents a picture of despair;
     Altho' as far as I'm concerned,
     I love to see the tables turned.
     The Harrier flies with all his might,
     It is a harum-scare'm flight:
     I'm not surprised he does not care
     To meet the fierce pursuing Hare!




  [Illustration; The Pipe-fish. The Sea-gar.]

     To smoke a herring is to make
     A most lamentable mistake,
     Particularly since there are
     The Pipe-fish and the long Sea-gar:
     Bear this in mind when next you wish
     To smoke your after-dinner fish.




  [Illustration: The Cow. The Cowry.]

     The Cowry seems to be, somehow,
     A sort of mouth-piece for the Cow:
     A speaking likeness one might say,
     Which I've endeavored to portray.




  [Illustration: The Doe. The Dodo.]

     The Doe and her peculiar _double_
     No longer are a source of trouble,
     Because the Dodo, it appears,
     Has been extinct for many years.
     She was too proud to disembark
     With total strangers in Noah's Ark,
     And we rejoice because her pride
     Our Nature book has simplified.




  [Illustration: The Ray. The Raven.]

     The Raven is a kind of crow,
     Immortalized by Mr. Poe,
     And we are often led astray
     By its resemblance to the Ray;
     The one which I denominate,
     Is termed by fisher-men the Skate;
     I much prefer the latter phrase,
     There are so many kinds of Rays:
     There're Rays of hope, and Rays of light.
     X Rays, and Rays more _re_-con-dite,
     Which, though of interest to Science,
     With Ravens have but small alliance.




  [Illustration: The Coot. The Bandicoot.]

     I do not wish to at-tri-bute
     Importance to the common Coot,
     Or mud-hen, whom most persons scorn,
     Because she chanced to be "Earth-born".
     The small Australian Bandicoots
     Are said to spring from Kanga-roots,
     Which roots, as you of course foresee,
     Are those of their ancestral tree,
     The motto of which vegetable
     Is just "O possum"[B] (I am able).


 [B]  The Bandicoot and Kangaroo,
      As well as the Opossum too,
      Are relatives because all three
      Belong to the same family.

  [Illustration]




  [Illustration: The Ape. The Grape.
   To see her shape
   Invert the ape!]

     The Apes, from whom we are descended,
     Hang ape-x down from trees suspended,
     And since we find them in the trees,
     We term them arbor-iginees.
     We all have seen the monkey-shines,
     Cut up by those who pluck from vines
     The Grape and then subject its juices
     To Baccha-nalian abuses.




  [Illustration: The Elk. The Whelk.]

     A roar of welkome through the welkin
     Is certain proof you'll find the Elk "in";
     But if you listen to the shell,
     In which the Whelk is said to dwell,
     And hear a roar, beyond a doubt
     It indicates the Whelk is "out".




  [Illustration: Cross Bill. Sweet William.]

     No-body but an imbecile
     Mistakes Sweet William for Cross Bill;
     And even I can scarcely claim
     The skill to make them look the same,
     Which proves there's nothing in a name.




  [Illustration: The Pitcher Plant. The Fly-Catcher.]

     The Pitcher Plant we may define,
     The flower of the base-ball nine;
     This name perhaps the plant belies,
     For Pitcher Plants sometimes catch flies;
     The "Fly"-Catcher we educate
     To firmly stand behind the plate,
     To stop, and treat with circumspection,
     Whatever comes in his direction.




  [Illustration: The Antelope. The Cantelope.]

     The Antelope and Cantelope
     Lie side by side upon the slope,
     And careless persons might, I fear,
     Mistake the melon for the deer.
     If you will tap the Cantelope, reposing on the ground,
     It does not move, but just emits a melon-choly sound;
     But should you try, however, to apply a stethoscope,
     And attempt this auscultation on the antlered Antelope,
     And should see an imitation of a very rapid flight,
     And should say, "It is the Antelope!" I think you would be right.




  [Illustration: The P-Cock. The Q-Cumber.]

     The striking similarity of this P-Q-liar pair,
     No longer need en-cumber us or fill us with despair;
     The P-Cock and the Q-Cumber you never need confuse.
     If you pay attention to the I's[Illustration] and mind your P's
      and Q's.




  [Illustration: The Pen-guin. The Sword-fish.]

     We have for many years been bored
     By that old saw about the sword
     And pen, and now we all rejoice,
     To see how Nature made her choice:
     She made, regardless of offendin',
     The Sword-fish mightier than the Penguin.




  [Illustration: The Yellow-Hammer.]

  [Illustration: The Saw-Fish.]

     The Yellow-Hammer, or the Flicker,
     More briefly "Golden-winged Wood-picker",
     My drawing of which _striking_ bird
     May seem to you perhaps absurd,
     You even may suspect I stole
     The idea from some Totem-pole:
     But when you gaze upon the Fish,
     You lose all patience and say "Pish!
     I don't believe you ever saw
     A Saw-fish look like this, Oh Pshaw!
     There certainly is some mistake,
     This is a saw-did Nature fake,
     In fact a perfect cata-clysm
     Of fishy Yellow-journalism."




  [Illustration: The Pansy. The Chim-pansy.]

     Observe how Nature's necromancies
     Have clearly painted on the Pansies
     These almost human counte-nances,
     In yellow, blue and black nu-ances.
     The face, however, seems to me
     To be that of the Chimpanzee,
     A fact which makes the gentle Pansy
     Appeal no longer to my fancy.




  [Illustration: Naught. Nautilus.]

     The Argonaut or Nautilus,
     With habits quite adventurous,
     A combination of a snail,
     A jelly-fish and paper sail.
     The parts of him that did not jell
     Are packed securely in his shell.
     It is not strange that when I sought
     To find his double, I found naught.




     Author's Add-end-'em.


     If you have read my former words,
     And learned to recognize the Birds,
     And how to tell them from Flowers,
     And know these Analogues of ours,
     You never need be led astray
     By Darwin, Audubon, or Gray,
     Whose writings, though considered classic,
     Savor some-what of the Jurassic.
     Your work though is but just begun,
     While mine, I'm glad to say, is done.
     To you the field I now leave clear,
     Upset my ink, and disappear!

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
