  _Dedicated to
  Helen Whitney_


  Do you recall those bygone days,
  When you received with kindly praise
    My bantling book of Rhyme?
  Praise undeserved, alas! and yet
  How sweet! For, tho' we had not met,
    (Ah! what a waste of time!)
  I could the more enjoy such mercies
  Since I delighted in _your_ verses.

  And when a Poet stoops to smile
  On some one of the rank and file,
    (Inglorious--if not mute,)
  Some groundling bard who craves to climb,
  Like me, the dizzy rungs of Rhyme,
    To reach the Golden Fruit;
  For one in such a situation
  The faintest praise is no damnation.

  Parnassus heights must surely pall;
  For simpler diet do you call,
    Of nectar growing tired?
  These verses to your feet I bring,
  Drawn from an unassuming spring,
    Well-meant--if not inspired;
  O charming Poet's charming daughter,
  Descend and taste my toast and water!

  For you alone these lines I write,
  That, reading them, your brow may light
    Beneath its crown of bays;
  Your eyes may sparkle like a star,
  With friendship, that is dearer far
    Than any breath of praise;
  The which a lucky man possessing
  Can ask no higher human blessing.

  And, though the "salt estranging sea"
  Be widely spread 'twixt you and me,
    We have what makes amends;
  And since I am so glad of you,
  Be glad of me a little, too,
    Because of being friends.
  And, if I earn your approbation,
  Accept my humble dedication.

                        H. G.




  _Foreword_


  The Press may pass my Verses by
    With sentiments of indignation,
  And say, like Greeks of old, that I
    Corrupt the Youthful Generation;
  I am unmoved by taunts like these--
  (And so, I think, was Socrates).

  Howe'er the Critics may revile,
    I pick no journalistic quarrels,
  Quite realizing that my Style
    Makes up for any lack of Morals;
  For which I feel no shred of shame--
  (And Byron would have felt the same).

  I don't intend a Child to read
    These lines, which are not for the Young;
  For, if I did, I should indeed
    Feel fully worthy to be hung.
  (Is "hanged" the perfect tense of "hang"?
  Correct me, Mr. Andrew Lang!)

  O Young of Heart, tho' in your prime,
    By you these Verses may be seen!
  Accept the Moral with the Rhyme,
    And try to gather what I mean.
  But, if you can't, it won't hurt me!
  (And Browning would, I know, agree.)

  Be reassured, I have not got
    The style of Stephen Phillips' heroes,
  Nor Henry Jones's pow'r of Plot,
    Nor wit like Arthur Wing Pinero's!
  (If so, I should not waste my time
  In writing you this sort of rhyme.)

  I strive to paint things as they Are,
    Of Realism the true Apostle;
  All flow'ry metaphors I bar,
    Nor call the homely thrush a "throstle."
  Such synonyms would make me smile.
  (And so they would have made Carlyle.)

  My Style may be at times, I own,
    A trifle cryptic or abstruse;
  In this I do not stand alone,
    And need but mention, in excuse,
  A thousand world-familiar names,
  From Meredith to Henry James.

  From these my fruitless fancy roams
    To seek the Ade of Modern Fable,
  From Doyle's or Hemans' "Stately Ho(l)mes,"
    To t'other of The Breakfast Table;
  Like Galahad, I wish (in vain)
  "My wit were as the wit of Twain!"

  Had I but Whitman's rugged skill,
    (And managed to escape the Censor),
  The Accuracy of a Mill,
    The Reason of a Herbert Spencer,
  The literary talents even
  Of Sidney Lee or Leslie Stephen.

  The pow'r of Patmore's placid pen,
    Or Watson's gift of execration,
  The sugar of Le Gallienne,
    Or Algernon's Alliteration.
  One post there is I'd not be lost in,
  --Tho' I might find it most ex-austin'!

  Some day, if I but study hard,
    The public, vanquished by my pen'll
  Acclaim me as a Minor Bard,
    Like Norman Gale or Mrs. Meynell,
  And listen to my lyre a-rippling
  Imperial banjo-spasms like Kipling.

  Were I a syndicate like K.
    Or flippant scholar like Augustine;
  Had I the style of Pater, say,
    Which ev'ryone would put their trust in,
  I'd love (as busy as a squirrel)
  To pate, to kipple, and to birrel.

  So don't ignore me. If you should,
    'Twill touch me to the very heart oh!
  To be as much misunderstood
    As once was Andrea del Sarto;
  Unrecognized to toil away,
  Like Millet--not, of course, Mill_ais_.

  And, pray, for Morals do not look
    In this unique agglomeration,
  --This unpretentious little book
    Of Infelicitous Quotation.
  I deem you foolish if you do,
  (And Mr. Russell thinks so, too).




  _"Virtue is Its Own Reward"_


  Virtue its own reward? Alas!
    And what a poor one as a rule!
  Be Virtuous and Life will pass
    Like one long term of Sunday-School.
  (No prospect, truly, could one find
  More unalluring to the mind.)

  You may imagine that it pays
    To practise Goodness. Not a bit!
  You cease receiving any praise
    When people have got used to it;
  'Tis generally understood
  You find it _easy_ to be good.

  The Model Child has got to keep
    His fingers and his garments white;
  In church he may not go to sleep,
    Nor ask to stop up late at night.
  In fact he must not ever do
  A single thing he wishes to.

  He may not paddle in his boots,
    Like naughty children, at the Sea;
  The sweetness of Forbidden Fruits
    Is not, alas! for such as he.
  He watches, with pathetic eyes,
  His weaker brethren make mud-pies.

  He must not answer back, oh no!
    However rude grown-ups may be,
  But keep politely silent, tho'
    He brim with scathing repartee;
  For nothing is considered worse
  Than scoring off Mamma or Nurse.

  He must not eat too much at meals,
    Nor scatter crumbs upon the floor;
  However vacuous he feels,
    He may not pass his plate for more;
  --Not tho' his ev'ry organ ache
  For further slabs of Christmas cake.

  He is enjoined to choose his food
    From what is easy to digest;
  A choice which in itself is good,
    But never what _he_ likes the best.
  (At times how madly he must wish
  For just _one_ real unwholesome dish!)

  And, when the wretched urchin plays
    With other little girls and boys,
  He has to show unselfish ways
    By giving them his choicest toys;
  His ears he lets them freely box,
  Or pull his lubricated locks.

  His face is always being washed,
    His hair perpetually brushed,
  And thus his brighter side is squashed,
    His human instincts warped and crushed;
  Small wonder that his early years
  Are filled with "thoughts too deep for tears."

  He is commanded not to waste
    The fleeting hours of childhood's days
  By giving way to any taste
    For circuses or matinees;
  For him the entertainments planned
  Are "Lectures on the Holy Land."

  He never reads a story book
    By Rider H. or Winston C.,
  In vain upon his desk you'd look
    For tales by Richard Harding D.;
  Nor could you find upon his shelf
  The works of Rudyard--or myself!

  He always fears that he may do
    Some action that is _infra dig._,
  And so he lives his short life through
    In the most noxious role of Prig.
  ("Short life" I say, for it's agreed
  The Good die very young indeed.)

  Ah me! How sad it is to think
    He could have lived like me--or you!
  With practice and a taste for drink,
    Our joys he might have known, he too!
  And shared the pleasure _we_ have had
  In being gloriously bad!

  The Naughty Boy gets much delight
    From doing what he should not do;
  But, as such conduct isn't Right,
    He sometimes suffers for it, too.
  Yet, what's a spanking to the fun
  Of leaving vital things Undone?

  If he's notoriously bad,
    But for a day should change his ways,
  His parents will be all so glad,
    They'll shower him with gifts and praise!
  (It pays a connoisseur in crimes
  To be a perfect saint at times.)

  Of course there always lies the chance
    That he is charged with being ill,
  And all his innocent romance
    Is ruined by a rhubarb pill.
  (Alas! 'Tis not alone the Good
  That are so much misunderstood.)

  But, as a rule, when he behaves
    (Evincing no malarial signs),
  His friends are all his faithful slaves,
    Until he once again declines
  With easy conscience, more or less,
  To undiluted wickedness.

  The Wicked flourish like the bay,
    At Cards or Love they always win,
  Good Fortune dogs their steps all day,
    They fatten while the Good grow thin.
  The Righteous Man has much to bear;
  The Bad becomes a Bullionaire!

  For, though he be the greatest sham,
    Luck favours him his whole life through;
  At "Bridge" he always makes a Slam
    After declaring "Sans atout";
  With ev'ry deal his fate has planned
  A hundred Aces in his hand.

   And it is always just the same;
    He somehow manages to win,
  By mere good fortune, any game
    That he may be competing in.
  At Golf no bunker breaks his club,
  For him the green provides no "rub."

  At Billiards, too, he flukes away
    (With quite unnecessary "side");
  No matter what he tries to play,
    For him the pockets open wide;
  He never finds both balls in baulk,
  Or makes miss-cues for want of chalk.

  He swears; he very likely bets;
    He even wears a flaming necktie;
  Inhales Egyptian cigarettes
    And has a "Mens Inconscia Recti";
  Yet, spite of all, one must confess
  That naught succeeds like his excess.

  There's no occasion to be Just,
    No need for motives that are fine,
  To be Director of a Trust,
    Or Manager of a Combine;
  Your corner is a public curse,
  Perhaps; but it will fill your purse.

  Then stride across the Public's bones,
    Crush all opponents under you,
  Until you "rise on stepping-stones
    Of their dead selves"; and, when you do,
  The widow's and the orphan's tears
  Shall comfort your declining years!

  But having had your boom in oil,
    And made your millions out of it,
  Would you propose to cease from toil?
    Great Vanderfeller! Not a bit!
  You've _got_ to labour, day and night,
  Until you die--and serve you right!

  Then, when you stop this frenzied race,
    And others in your office sit,
  You'll leave the world a better place,
    --The better for your leaving it!
  For there's a chance perhaps your heir
  May spend what you've collected there.

  Myself, how lucky I must be,
    That need not fear so gross an end;
  Since Fortune has not favoured me
    With many million pounds to spend.
  (Still, did that fickle Dame relent,
  I'd show you how they _should_ be spent!)

  I am not saint enough to feel
    My shoulder ripen to a wing,
  Nor have I wits enough to steal
    His title from the Copper King;
  And there's a vasty gulf between
  The Man I Am and Might Have Been;

  But tho' at dinner I may take
    Too much of Heidsieck (extra dry),
  And underneath the table make
    My simple couch just where I lie,
  My mode of roosting on the floor
  Is just a trick and nothing more.

  And when, not Wisely but too Well,
    My thirst I have contrived to quench,
  The stories I am apt to tell
    May be, perhaps, a trifle French;
  (For 'tis in anecdote, no doubt,
  That what's Bred in the Beaune comes out.)

  It does not render me unfit
    To give advice, both wise and right,
  Because I do not follow it
    Myself as closely as I might;
  There's nothing that I wouldn't do
  To point the proper road to _you_.

  And this I'm sure of, more or less,
    And trust that you will all agree,
  The Elements of Happiness
    Consist in being--just like Me;
  No sinner, nor a saint perhaps,
  But--well, the very best of chaps.

  Share the Experience I have had,
    Consider all I've known and seen,
  And Don't be Good, and Don't be Bad,
    But cultivate a Golden Mean.

  What makes Existence _really_ nice
  Is Virtue--with a dash of Vice.




  "_Enough is as Good as a Feast._"


  What is Enough? An idle dream!
    One cannot have enough, I swear,
  Of Ices or Meringues-and-Cream,
    Nougat or Chocolate Eclairs,
  Of Oysters or of Caviar,
  Of Prawns or Pate de Foie _Grar_!

  Who would not willingly forsake
    Kindred and Home, without a fuss,
  For Icing from a Birthday Cake,
    Or juicy fat Asparagus,
  And journey over countless seas
  For New Potatoes and Green Peas?

  They say that a Contented Mind
    Is a Continual Feast;--but where
  The mental frame, and how to find,
    Which can with Turtle Soup compare?
  No mind, however full of Ease,
  Could be Continual Toasted Cheese.

  For dinner have a sole to eat,
    (Some Perrier Jouet, '92,)
  An Entree then (and, with the meat,
    A bottle of Lafitte will do),
  A quail, a glass of port (just one),
  Liqueurs and coffee, and you've done.

  But should you want a hearty meal,
    And not this gourmet's lightsome snack,
  Fill up with terrapin and teal,
    Clam chowder, crabs and canvasback;
  With all varieties of sauce,
  And diff'rent wines for ev'ry course.

  Your tastes may be of simpler type;--
    A homely glass of "half-and-half,"
  An onion and a dish of tripe,
    Or headpiece of the kindly calf.
  (Cruel perhaps, but then, you know,
  "_'Faut tout souffrir pour etre veau!_")

  'Tis a mistake to eat too much
    Of any dishes but the best;
  And you, of course, should never touch
    A thing you _know_ you can't digest;
  For instance, lobster;--if you _do_,
  Well,--I'm amayonnaised at you!

  Let this be your heraldic crest,
    A bottle (charge) of Champagne,
  A chicken (gorged) with salad (dress'd),
    Below, this motto to explain--
  "Enough is Very Good, may be;
  Too Much is Good Enough for Me!"




  "_Don't Buy a Pig in a Poke._"


  Unscrupulous Pigmongers will
    Attempt to wheedle and to coax
  The ignorant young housewife till
    She purchases her pigs in pokes;
  Beasts that have got a Lurid Past,
  Or else are far Too Good to Last.

  So, should you not desire to be
    The victim of a cruel hoax,
  Then promise me, ah! promise me,
    You will not purchase pigs in pokes!
  ('Twould be an error just as big
  To poke your purchase in a pig.)

  Too well I know the bitter cost,
    To turn this subject off with jokes;
  How many a fortune has been lost
    By men who purchased pigs in pokes.
  (Ah! think on such when you would talk
  With mouths that are replete with pork!)

  And, after dinner, round the fire,
    Astride of Grandpa's rugged knee,
  Implore your bored but patient sire
    To tell you what a Poke may be.
  The fact he might disclose to you--
  Which is far more than _I_ can do.

     *     *     *     *     *

  The Moral of The Pigs and Pokes
    Is not to make your choice too quick.
  In purchasing a Book of Jokes,
    Pray poke around and take your pick.
  Who knows how rich a mental meal
  The covers of _this_ book conceal?




  "_Learn to Take Things Easily._"


  To these few words, it seems to me,
    A wealth of sound instruction clings;
  O Learn to Take things easily--
    Espeshly Other People's Things;
  And Time will make your fingers deft
  At what is known as Petty Theft.

  Your precious moments do not waste;
    Take Ev'rything that isn't tied!
  Who knows but you may have a Taste,
    A Gift perhaps, for Homicide,--
  (A Mania which, encouraged, thrives
  On Taking Other People's Lives).

  "Fools and Their Money soon must part!"
    And you can help this on, may be,
  If, in the kindness of your Heart,
    You Learn to Take things easily;
  And be, with little education,
  A Prince of Misappropriation.




  "_A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss._"


  I never understood, I own,
    What anybody (with a soul)
  Could mean by offering a Stone
    This needless warning not to Roll;
  And what inducement there can be
  To gather Moss I fail to see.

  I'd sooner gather anything,
    Like primroses, or news perhaps,
  Or even wool (when suffering
    A momentary mental lapse);
  But could forego my share of moss,
  Nor ever realize the loss.

  'Tis a botanical disease,
    And worthy of remark as such;
  Lending a dignity to trees,
    To ruins a romantic touch.
  A timely adjunct, I've no doubt,
  But not worth writing home about.

  Of all the Stones I ever met,
    In calm repose upon the ground,
  I really never found one yet
    With a desire to roll around;
  Theirs is a stationary role,--
  (A joke,--and feeble on the whole).

  But, if I were a stone, I swear
    I'd sooner move and view the World
  Than sit and grow the greenest hair
    That ever Nature combed and curled.
  I see no single saving grace
  In being known as "Mossyface!"

  Instead, I might prove useful for
    A weapon in the hand of Crime,
  A paperweight, a milestone, or
    A missile at Election time;
  In each capacity I could
  Do quite incalculable good.

  When well directed from the Pit,
    I might promote a welcome death,
  If fortunate enough to hit
    Some budding Hamlet or Macbeth,
  Who twice each day the playhouse fills,--
  (For further Notice See Small Bills).

  At concerts, too, if you prefer,
    I could prevent your growing deaf,
  By silencing the amateur
    Before she reached that upper F.;
  Or else, in lieu of half-a-brick,
  Restrain some local Kubelik.

  Then, human stones, take my advice,
    (As you should always do, indeed);
  This proverb may be very nice,
    But don't you pay it any heed,
  And, tho' you make the critics cross,
  Roll on, and never mind the moss.




  "_After Dinner Sit a While; After
  Supper Walk a Mile._"


  After luncheon sit awhile,
    'Tis an admirable plan;
  After dinner walk a mile--
    But make certain that you _can_.
  (Were you not this maxim taught;--
  "Good is Wrought by want of Port.")

  After dinner think on this;
    Join the ladies with a smile,
  And remember that a Miss
    Is as good as any mile.
  (Thus you may be led to feel
  What Amis felt for Amile.)

  Never fear of being shy
    At the houses where you dine;
  You'll recover by-and-bye,
    With the second glass of wine;
  And can recognize with bliss
  That a Meal is not amiss.




  "_It is Never Too Late to Mend._"


  Since it can never be too late
    To change your life, or else renew it,
  Let the unpleasant process wait
    Until you are _compelled_ to do it.
  The State provides (and gratis too)
  Establishments for such as you.

  Remember this, and pluck up heart,
    That, be you publican or parson,
  Your ev'ry art must have a start,
    From petty larceny to arson;
  And even in the burglar's trade,
  The cracksman is not born, but made.

  So, if in your career of crime,
    You fail to carry out some "coup",
  Then try again a second time,
    And yet again, until you _do_;
  And don't despair, or fear the worst,
  Because you get found out at first.

  Perhaps the battle will not go,
    On all occasions, to the strongest;
  You may be fairly certain tho'
    That He Laughs Last who laughs the Longest.
  So keep a good reserve of laughter,
  Which may be found of use hereafter.

  Believe me that, howe'er well meant,
    A Good Resolve is always brief;
  Don't let your precious hours be spent
    In turning over a new leaf.
  Such leaves, like Nature's, soon decay,
  And then are only in the way.

  The Road to--well, a certain spot,
    (A Road of very fair dimensions),
  Has, so the proverb tells us, got
    A parquet-floor of Good Intentions.
  Take care, in your desire to please,
  You do not add a brick to these.

  For there may come a moment when
    You shall be mended willy-nilly,
  With many more misguided men,
    Whose skill is undermined with skilly.
  Till then procrastinate, my friend;
  "It _Never_ is Too Late to Mend!"




  "_A Bad Workman Complains of his Tools._"


  This Pen of mine is simply grand,
    I never loved a pen so much;
  This Paper (underneath my hand)
    Is really a delight to touch;
  And never in my life, I think,
  Did I make use of finer ink.

  The Subject upon which I write
    Is everything that I could choose;
  I seldom knew my Wits more bright,
    More cosmopolitan my Views;
  Nor ever did my Head contain
  So surplus a supply of Brain!




  _Potpourri._


  There are many more Maxims to which
    I would like to accord a front place,
  But alas! I have got
  To omit a whole lot,
    For the lack of available space;
  And the rest I am forced to boil down and condense
  To the following Essence of Sound without Sense:


  Now the Pitcher that journeys too oft
    To the Well will get broken at last.
  But you'll find it a fact
  That, by using some tact,
    Such a danger as this can be past.
  (There's an obvious way, and a simple, you'll own,
  Which is, if you're a Pitcher, to Let Well alone.)


  Half a loafer is never well-bred,
    And Self-Praise is a Dangerous Thing.
  And the Mice are at play
  When the Cat is away,
    For a moment, inspecting a King.
  (Tho' if Care kills a Cat, as the Proverbs declare,
  It is right to suppose that the King will take care.)


  Don't Halloo till you're out of the Wood,
    When a Stitch in Good Time will save nine,
  While a Bird in the Hand
  Is worth Two, understand,
    In the Bush that Needs no Good Wine.
  (Tho' the two, if they _Can_ sing but Won't, have been known,
  By an accurate aim to be killed with one Stone.)


  Never Harness the Cart to the Horse;
    Since the latter should be _a la carte_.
  And Birds of a Feather
  Come Flocking Together,
    Because they can't well Flock Apart.
  (You may cast any Bread on the Waters, I think,
  But, unless I'm mistaken, you can't make it Sink.)


  It is only the Fool who remarks
    That there Can't be a Fire without Smoke;
  Has he never yet learned
  How the gas can be turned
    On the best incombustible coke?
  (Would you value a man by the checks on his suits,
  And forget "_que c'est le premier passbook qui Coutts_?")


  Now "_De Mortuis Nil Nisi Bo-
    num_," is Latin, as ev'ryone owns;
  If your domicile be
  Near a Mortuaree,
    You should always avoid throwing bones.
  (I would further remark, if I could,--but I couldn't--
  That People Residing in Glasshouses shouldn't.)


  You have heard of the Punctual Bird,
    Who was First in presenting his Bill;
  But I pray you'll be firm,
  And remember the Worm
    Had to get up much earlier still;
  (So that, if you _can't_ rise in the morning, then Don't;
  And be certain that Where there's a Will there's a Won't.)


  You can give a bad name to a Dog,
    And hang him by way of excuse;
  Whereas Hunger, of course,
  Is by far the Best Sauce
    For the Gander as well as the Goose.
  (But you shouldn't judge anyone just by his looks,
  For a Surfeit of Broth ruins too many Cooks.)


  With the fact that Necessity knows
    Nine Points of the Law, you'll agree.
  There are just as Good Fish
  To be found on a Dish
    As you ever could catch in the Sea.
  (You should Look ere you Leap on a Weasel Asleep,
  And I've also remarked That Still Daughters Run Cheap.)


  The much trodden-on Lane _will_ Turn,
    And a Friend is in Need of a Friend;
  But the Wisest of Saws,
  Like the Camel's Last Straws,
    Or the Longest of Worms, have an end.
  So, before out of Patience a Virtue you make,
  A decisive farewell of these maxims we'll take.




  _Envoi._

  _"Don't Look a Gifthorse in the Mouth"_


  I knew a man, who lived down South;
    He thought this maxim to defy;
  He looked a Gifthorse in the Mouth;
    The Gifthorse bit him in the Eye!
  And, while the steed enjoyed his bite,
  My Southern friend mislaid his sight.

  Now, had this foolish man, that day,
    Observed the Gifthorse in the _Heel_,
  It might have kicked his brains away,
    But that's a loss he would not feel;
  Because you see (need I explain?)
  My Southern friend had got no brain.

  When anyone to you presents
    A poodle, or a pocketknife,
  A set of Ping-pong instruments,
    A banjo or a Lady-wife,
  'Tis churlish, as I understand,
  To grumble that they're second-hand.

  And he who termed Ingratitude
    As "worser nor a servant's tooth"
  Was evidently well imbued
    With all the elements of Truth;
  (While he who said "Uneasy lies
  The tooth that wears a crown" was wise).

  "One must be poor," George Eliot said,
    "To know the luxury of giving;"
  So too one really should be dead
    To realize the joy of living.
  (I'd sooner be--I don't know which--
  I'd _like_ to be alive and rich!)

  _This_ book may be a Gifthorse too,
    And one you surely ought to prize;
  If so, I beg you, read it through
    With kindly and uncaptious eyes,
  Not grumbling because this particular line doesn't happen to scan,
  And this one doesn't rhyme!




  _Aftword._


  'Tis done! We reach the final page,
    With feelings of relief, I'm certain;
  And there arrives at such a stage,
    The moment to ring down the curtain.
  (This metaphor is freely taken
  From Shakespeare--or perhaps from Bacon.)

  The Book perused, our Future brings
    A plethora of blank to-morrows,
  When memories of Happier Things
    Will be our Sorrow's Crown of Sorrows.
  (I trust you recognize this line
  As being Tennyson's, not mine.)

  My verses may indeed be few,
    But are they not, to quote the poet,
  "The sweetest things that ever grew
    Beside a human door"? I know it.
  (What an _in_human door would be,
  Enquire of Wordsworth, please, not me.)

  'Twas one of my most cherished dreams
    To write a Moral Book some day;
  What says the Bard? "The best laid schemes
    Of Mice and Men gang aft agley!"
  (The Bard here mentioned, by the bye,
  Is Robbie Burns, of course--not I.)

  And tho' my pen records each thought
    As swift as the phonetic Pitman,
  Morality is not my "forte,"
    O Camarados! (_vide_ Whitman)
  And, like the Porcupine, I still
  Am forced to ply a fretful quill.

  We may be Master of our Fate,
    (As Henley was inspired to mention)
  Yet am I but the Second Mate
    Upon the ss. "Good Intention";
  For me the course direct is lacking--
  I have to do a deal of tacking.

  To seek for Morals here's a task
    Of which you well may be despairing;
  "What has become of them?" you ask,
    They've given us the slip--like Waring.
  "Look East!" said Browning once, and I
  Would make a similar reply.

  Look East, where in a garret drear,
    The Author works, without cessation,
  Composing verses for a mere-
    ly nominal remuneration;
  And, while he has the strength to write 'em,
  Will do so still--_ad infinitum_.




      FINIS.



Transcriber's Notes:

The words 'bo-num' and 'mere-ly' were retained hyphenated at the ends of
lines to match the printed edition and maintain the poetical intent of
the author.

Changed 'Heidsick' to 'Heidsieck.'

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
