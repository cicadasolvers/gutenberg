                A New Bat (Genus Myotis) From Mexico[1]

                 WALTER W. DALQUEST AND E. RAYMOND HALL


While one of us (Dalquest) was in a dugout canoe that was being paddled
up a small unnamed tributary of the Rio Coatzacoalcos, through dense
jungle, he grasped a decayed and termite damaged tree-trunk projecting
approximately three feet above the surface of the water to steady the
canoe. At that instant two bats were detected in one of the many small
holes in the trunk, which was eight to nine inches in diameter. It was a
simple matter to enlarge the hole and extract the animals. Superficially
they resembled silvery-haired bats (_Lasionycteris_) but their naked
interfemoral membranes and other features suggested that they belonged
to the genus _Myotis_. Subsequently, study in the laboratory showed this
to be the fact and revealed also that they are of an heretofore unnamed
species which may be known as:


                    #Myotis argentatus#, new species

    _Type._--Male, adult, skin with skull, No. 19228, Mus. Nat.
    Hist., Univ. Kansas; 14 kilometers southwest of Coatzocoalcos,
    100 feet elevation, Veracruz, Mexico; 2 February 1947; obtained
    by Walter W. Dalquest; original No. 7052.

    _Range._--Known only from the type locality.

    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the genus (see measurements), tail
    short; foot long; ears and membranes black; pelage long (maximum
    length on middle of back 9 mm.) and black; upper parts with
    overhairs tipped with whitish especially on rump; underparts
    from posterior part of thorax posteriorly with all of the hairs
    tipped with this same whitish color; skull with preorbital part
    small in relation to brain case; teeth small in relation to
    total area of palate; brain case much inflated; ventral margin
    of foramen magnum evenly rounded.

    _Comparison._--From _Myotis albescens_ (E. Geffroy) known to us
    by specimens in the United States National Museum from Paraguay
    (Tacural), Panama (Tabernilla), and Nicaragua (Prinzapolca R.
    and Escondido R.), _argentatus_ differs in: Body and foot
    longer; tail relatively shorter (57 and 58% of length of head
    and body versus 76 (62-83)% in _albescens_); tibia shorter;
    pelage longer, and black instead of brown; silver tipping of fur
    on hinder back markedly more conspicuous; precranial part of
    skull, when viewed from above, larger in relation to brain case;
    postorbital constriction less abrupt, that is to say, skull
    "longer-waisted"; occlusal surfaces of teeth of equal area and
    therefore occupying a relatively smaller percentage of total
    area of palatal surface; ventral margin of foramen magnum less
    deeply indented; ventrally prominent part of basioccipital twice
    as wide.

_Remarks._--The relatively slight wear on the teeth of the female of _M.
argentatus_ and the large ends on the bones of the wings indicate that
it is immature. Its measurements, recorded below, average smaller than
those of the adult holotype, a male, and the silvery tipping on the
upper parts is almost lacking from the pelage which is shorter than in
the holotype.

    [Illustration: FIGS. 1-6. _Myotis_. From left to right, dorsal,
    lateral and ventral views. All x 2.

    FIGS. 1-3. _Myotis argentatus_, no. 19228, Univ. Kan. Mus. Nat.
    Hist., type.

    FIGS. 4-6. _Myotis albescens_, no. 105664, [F], U. S. Nat. Mus.,
    from Tacuaral, Paraguay; obtained on November 13, 1900, by Wm.
    T. Foster, orig. no. 128.]

Among at least American kinds of _Myotis_, _argentatus_ is extreme in
small area of occlusal surface of the upper molariform teeth in relation
to the total area of the palatal surface of the skull. _M. albescens_
previously was regarded as extreme in this feature. The distance across
the third upper molars, from the outside of one tooth to the outside of
the other, is 5.5 mm. in the holotype of _argentatus_ and 5.4 mm. in a
specimen of corresponding age and sex of _albescens_. The distance
between the third upper molars, from the lingual side of one tooth to
the lingual side of the other, is 2.9 mm. in _argentatus_ and 2.8 mm. in
_albescens_.

In each of our two specimens there is no sagittal crest but instead a
low ridge one millimeter wide which marks the space between the margins
of the two temporal muscles.

Allusion already has been made to the resemblance of the newly named
_Myotis argentatus_ to the silvery-haired bat, _Lasionycteris
noctivagans_ (LeConte). The whitish tips of the hairs are slightly more
yellowish in _argentatus_ but the difference is so slight as to be
detected by only the most careful comparison. The remainder of the
pelage in _argentatus_ is black as in the darkest individuals of
_Lasionycteris_.

Among named kinds of the genus _Myotis_, the species _argentatus_ most
closely resembles _Myotis albescens_ which, up to now has been recorded
from as far south as Argentina, in South America, and as far north as
Nicaragua, in Central America (Miller and Allen, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus.,
144:202, 203, 1928). The differences detected between the two species
are indicated above in the paragraph of comparisons and some other
differences can be detected by comparing measurements given below with
those of _M. albescens_ as recorded by Miller and Allen (_op. cit._:
204-205). In initial comparisons with _albescens_, only Paraguayan
specimens were employed. It was felt that specimens of _albescens_ from
the northernmost localities of occurrence might more closely resemble
_argentatus_. Accordingly, we appealed a second time to Dr. A. R.
Kellogg for comparative material and he lent us the specimens
(alcoholics with skulls separate) in the U. S. National Museum from
Central America. These also differ from our newly named bat in the same
fashion as do the South American specimens. Further, the number and
magnitude of the differences between _albescens_ and _argentatus_
greatly exceed any that can be pointed to between the American
subspecies of any other one full species of the genus _Myotis_. Full
specific, rather than mere subspecific, status, therefore, is suggested
for the bat here named _Myotis argentatus_.

    _Measurements._--The adult, male type, and the immature female
    specimen measure, respectively, as follows: Head and body, 55,
    51 mm.; tail, 32, 29; tibia, 13.7, 13.2; foot, 8, 9; forearm,
    33.0, 34.5; thumb, 5.8, 5.7; third metacarpal, 32.2, 30.5;
    fifth metacarpal, 31.5, 30.3; greatest length of skull, 14.5,
    14.0; condylobasal length, 13.8, 13.0; zygomatic breadth, 9.1,
    9.0; interorbital constriction, 4.3, 4.0; breadth of brain case,
    7.5, 7.4; occipital depth, 5.7, 5.7; mandible, 10.5, 10.0;
    maxillary tooth row, 5.3, 5.0; maxillary breadth at M3, 5.5,
    5.7; mandibular tooth row, 5.6, 5.3.

    _Specimens examined._--Two, from the type locality.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
