                             VACATION LAND

                         _Estes Park, Colorado_
              Center of the Nation's Greatest Playground--
                     _Rocky Mountain National Park_


    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

At the Eastern entrance to this National playground is the modern town
of Estes Park, with an elevation of 7,549 feet. Estes Park has daily
mail service, direct telegraph and long distance telephone connections,
and most efficient electric and phone service. Its water, only a few
hours from the eternal snow fields, is 99 per cent pure by test, and
fresh pure milk from inspected herds is delivered daily.

There is also a fine Public Library, an Auditorium, Protestant and
Catholic churches, and an up-to-date weekly newspaper and printing
plant.

Adjoining the Village is the Estes Aviation Country Club featuring a
3000 ft. runway, 9-hole golf course, tennis courts, scenic passenger
flights and other recreational activities.

There is a well managed pavilion for those who like to dance. Special
dances are frequently held at many of the hotels and lodges. The
theatres offer the latest motion picture releases. Horseback riding,
bowling, hiking and golf are major recreational activities.

Adjoining the Village are the administration headquarters for the
fifty-four million dollar Colorado-Big Thompson Diversion project, which
is to divert the waters of the Colorado river from the western to the
eastern slopes of the Continental Divide by means of a 13-mile tunnel
through the Rockies.

Outstanding and nationally known boys' and girls' camps where young
people may enjoy healthful surroundings under sympathetic instructors
offer campcraft, woodcraft, mountaineering, natural science and
horsemanship.

During the summer Estes Park is the center of activity for many
thousands of people, its local shops and stores economically supplying
their every need. These stores are up-to-date and stocks are complete.
Prices are moderate. Many of these stores maintain a daily delivery
service to outlying districts.

Come up here for a day, a week or a month and you'll go back home with
the gallery of your mind filled with the pictures these hills and
canyons and aspens, slopes and gulches and glaciers have hung upon its
walls.


                      Rocky Mountain National Park

Rocky Mountain National Park, adjoining Estes Park Village, embraces 405
square miles of unsurpassed mountain scenery, including 65 towering
peaks over 10,000 feet high, 150 highland lakes, scores of rushing
streams, babbling brooks and dashing waterfalls. Here the natural
attractions are so varied a visitor is almost bewildered by the wide
choice of vacation endeavors which could fill an entire summer.

Visitors are urged to take advantage of naturalist services. Schedules
of hikes and nature walks, as well as evening campfire discussions, are
announced weekly. Three museums on geologic, historic, biologic and
other aspects of the Park are open throughout the season. Auto caravans,
led by naturalists to outstanding areas too far for hiking, bring
visitors to rare regions of scenic wonder.

          Plan to Include These Auto Trips In Your Itinerary--

    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

ESTES PARK TO GRAND LAKE--Over spectacular Trail Ridge Road. Highest
through highway in the world.

FALL RIVER ROAD--Open to Chasm Falls. Good trip for picnics. This
highway open to UP travel only from Chasm Falls to Fall River Pass.

BEAR LAKE--Road paved. This trip takes you to the very base of the
range.

SOUTH ST. VRAIN, ALLENS PARK, LYONS--Return to Estes Park via NORTH ST.
VRAIN. A beautiful trip through the foothills.

BIG THOMPSON CANYON LOOP TRIP--Return to Estes Park via North St. Vrain
or South St. Vrain highways.

DEVIL'S GULCH TRIP--Through shady, winding roads to connect with new
scenic Big Thompson highway.

HORSESHOE PARK LOOP TRIP--Over High Drive and back through Horseshoe
Park and scenic section of Fall River road.

    [Illustration: Chasm Falls, on a tumbling mountain stream fresh from
    the ever-present snow banks, is just off the old Fall River highway,
    above Horseshoe Park.]

    [Illustration: Horseback riding is almost synonymous with a vacation
    at Estes Park. Into the very heart of the Rockies, thru pine scented
    forests, along the banks of crystal clear lakes, you can ride or
    hike.]

    [Illustration: Well stocked streams present a fisherman's paradise,
    and each year give up tons of rainbow and speckled beauties to
    anglers.]

    National Park and highest yacht anchorage in the world.]


                               LAKE ESTES

    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

Only a few minutes drive from the Village of Estes Park, at the foot of
majestic, snow-capped peaks and amid alpine splendor is beautiful new
Lake Estes.

Created as part of the Colorado-Big Thompson project, this lake is a
mecca for vacationists who enjoy water sports of all kinds.

There is lake fishing at its best since Lake Estes has been heavily
stocked with game trout. There is no satisfaction akin to landing a
fighting lake trout, unless it is eating one caught from the sparkling
clean waters of Lake Estes!

Many hours of relaxing enjoyment can be experienced in this
area--there's a particular sport for every member of the family, and
Lake Estes will help make your vacation complete. Boating, sun-bathing,
or hiking are but a few of the reasons why Lake Estes is the center of
activities in the Playground of America--Estes Park.

    [Illustration: This is an artist's conception of Lake Estes. Its
    waters held back by Olympus Dam. A half-mile above the inlet is the
    Village of Estes Park, and beyond the town the grandeur of the
    Rockies and the Continental Divide.]

    your vacation activities.]




                     _Estes Park--Vacation Center_


Surrounded by mountains of majestic beauty with their glacial gorges,
deep forests, tumbling mountain streams, blue shimmering lakes and
eternal snow, Estes Park Village is the center of activity for
vacationists from all over America. It is the answer to your dreams of a
vacation paradise.

Radiating from the Village are scenic highways offering every type of
mountain scenery from grassy aspen glens to the sheer rugged cliffs of
the Continental Divide.

And yet, in the Village itself and in the hotels, lodges and cottages
are to be found modern accommodations, excellent food, comfortable beds,
and all the services to meet your needs.

The Chamber of Commerce invites you to register at its office. We want
to assist in every way possible in making your visit the most enjoyable
you have ever had.

    [Illustration: LONGS PEAK From almost any point in the Park this
    peak can be seen reaching its towering summit, 14,255 feet above sea
    level into the clear, crisp air.]

    [Illustration: Winter sports show a tremendous gain in popularity
    especially for the young and hardy sportsman.]

                       _How to Get to Estes Park_


    [Illustration: {uncaptioned map}]

Driving? From the east you may take U. S. 6, 24, 34, 40 or 50 and
Colorado 7 or 66.

From the south, U. S. 85 or 87 to Denver; then a choice of U. S. 87 and
287 or Colorado 185, 7 and 66.

From the west, U. S. 40 or 50. And from the north, U. S. 85 or 87 to
Loveland where you take U. S. 34.

By rail? If so, just ask your local ticket agent to sell you a through
ticket, including a coupon for bus transportation to the Park. Baggage
may be checked straight through. At certain times of the year there are
special round trip rates, about which it is well to inquire.

Coming by air? New fast schedules place Denver not more than 8 hours
flying time from any point in the U. S. Local charter service between
Denver and Estes Park is available during the summer months. Check with
the airlines for detailed information.

Either coming or leaving, you should arrange to take a trip through the
beautiful Big Thompson Canyon, which is one of the most picturesque and
unique of all canyon drives. U. S. highway 34 is the Big Thompson route
into Estes Park.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
