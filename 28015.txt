FOREWORD


_By _CLARENCE H. WHITE
_President of the Pictorial Photographers of America_

To many people photography is merely a mechanical process.  To an
increasing number, however, photography is being seen as an art, by which
personal impressions of nature or human life may be expressed as truly as
by the brush.  These workers in photography see in it a medium by which
the action of light upon sensitive surfaces may be so controlled as really
to interpret scenes and persons in the individualistic spirit of a true
art.  From every part of our country come evidences of the growing
appreciation of photography as a pictorial medium.  Exhibitions in many
museums which have hitherto been indifferent to pictures made with the
lens have opened the eyes of the public to the possibilities of the
camera.  Clubs of photographic workers in various cities have maintained
or fostered the movement.  The lure of the moving picture has stimulated
the interest of countless multitudes in photography, and the occasional
presentation of fine pictorial work in this direction has given a prophecy
of better things to come.  The time, therefore, seems ripe to present in
this book a collection of the work of American pictorial photographers in
all sections of the country.  Many of these workers are members of the
organization known as the Pictorial Photographers of America; but the
appeal for photographic material for this book has been confined to no one
society or club, but has been widely inclusive of associations and
individuals, and it is believed that the work here presented is fairly
representative of the best American effort along these lines at the
present time.

It is the hope and intention of the organization that publishes this book
to stimulate interest in this branch of pictorial art.  This is believed
to be the first attempt in America to give a comprehensive presentation of
the status of pictorial photography as illustrated by the product of many
of its best workers.  As such it is commended to the consideration of
photographers both professional and amateur, of artists and art lovers,
and of the public generally.





THE PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHERS OF AMERICA


                      The Association's Work and Aim


_By_ EDWARD R. DICKSON

The Pictorial Photographers of America is an association having in mind
solely the development of the art of photography from a standpoint of
educational value.  Its position is unique, since the worker is afforded
not only an opportunity to exhibit his pictures in various museums and art
galleries, but is made to feel that maintaining photographic standards and
studying the arts for breadth of view are of chief importance.

Some of the advantages which photography offers are worth restating.  It
helps to draw one closer to nature and to seek fresh air.  Through the
exercise and cultivation of choice, it teaches how to decorate the home,
to dress with taste, and to keep an alert eye and mind on the passing
events of the world.  Because the Association knows that photography is
able to teach these things, it sought the aid of art museums and public
libraries to conduct photographic exhibitions so that children and adults
may not only see fine examples of the work of the camera in the hands of
artists, but be led thereby to appreciate more fully the value of
photography as an aid to interesting composition and a quickening of the
eye in realizing the beauty of sunlight and shadows which flit around us
much unrecognized at times.  Succeeding in gaining the sympathetic
co-operation of seventeen museums, in the winter of 1917-18 the
Association collected, from many of the most important workers in this
country, more than two hundred prints, which were divided into two groups
and exhibited as follows:

Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Milwaukee Art Institute, Art Institute of
Chicago, City Art Museum (St. Louis), Toledo Museum of Art, Detroit Museum
of Art, Cleveland Art Museum, Cincinnati Museum of Art, Morristown
Library, Newark Museum Association, New Britain (Conn.) Institute,
Worcester Art Museum, Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts, Guild of Allied Arts
(Buffalo), Grand Rapids Art Association, University of Oklahoma, New
Orleans Art Association.

There was also held in New York City an exhibition of the work of the New
England, New Jersey and Connecticut photographers, and among the immediate
activities of the Association will be the holding in New York of
exhibitions of the work of members of the Pacific Coast and other places,
so that there may be established a fuller understanding of the points of
view among the various pictorialists throughout the country.

The Association hopes to establish, in designated cities, pictorial
centers where photographs may always be seen, and centers for intercourse
and for exchange of views among workers. As a result of its plans, there
will soon be opened a branch of the Pictorial Photographers of America,
which will be called the Pacific Coast Chapter, embracing workers in the
following States: Oregon, California, Wyoming, Nevada, and Utah.  Meetings
will be held monthly, and lectures and exhibitions arranged in
co-operation with the parent body in New York.  As soon as this chapter
has begun active work, another will be opened in the New England and
Middle West States, modeled after the California chapter.  In this way the
Association hopes to be of national service in the advancement of
photography on educational lines, and it asks the sympathy of the public
as well as that of every worker of the camera in America.

Among other of its plans are: honoring those who have given valued service
to photography; the formation of a library; the establishment of a home
headquarters; the distribution of knowledge tending toward the making of
better catalogues; the art of hanging pictures so that their individual
beauty may be enhanced; the application of the motion picture to pictorial
expression; the recommendation of books on the development of the
individual, as well as others relating to the study of contemporary arts,
so that, through an acquaintance with all these, there may be brought to
the student a new and an individual approach in his photographic work.

The Association holds monthly meetings at the National Arts Club, 119 East
19th Street, New York, where exhibitions and lectures are given.
Admission is free.  The Association now publishes its first annual
"Pictorial Photography in America," which comprises the work of important
pictorialists in this country, whether or not members of the Association.
And in following out so broad a plan the Association has demonstrated to
its friends that its main interests lie in the presentation of fine work,
little caring who the individual may be.  As soon as the world has resumed
its normal stride, the Association will extend invitations for an
exhibition of foreign work to be shown in America.  In turn, the
Association will be glad to send an exhibition of American work abroad to
those who desire to see, more intimately than we are able to do by the
process of reproduction, what American pictorialists are doing.  In
another volume we hope to present the work of foreign pictorialists.

Plans are now being made whereby the original prints selected for this
Annual will be exhibited, under the direction of the American Federation
of Arts, in the galleries of many art museums throughout the country.

Herewith we list the names of the present officers and executive members
of the Association, as well as those who are members of the Council having
to do with pictorial activities in the different States.  Membership in
the Association is open to men and women of good character and ambitious
intentions, including those who, though not photographers, are interested
in the development of the art.

PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY IN NEW JERSEY


_By_ LOUIS F. BUCHER _of the Newark Camera Club, Inc._

In New Jersey, as well as in other States, pictorial photography was at
its lowest ebb during the period of the war.  The official ban on the use
of the camera in places that presented just the sort of material which
stirs the enthusiasm of the amateur photographer tended so to dampen his
ardor that his trusty "box" was left at home to accumulate dust.

But not for long, for a New Jersey cameraist, with the vision of a seer,
saw an opportunity to use his beloved instrument in a far-reaching
service.  His enthusiasm was soon imparted to fellow members of the Newark
Camera Club, and there quickly followed the birth of the Red Triangle
Camera Club, affiliated with the local Y. M. C. A.  Its object was pithily
expressed in its slogan, "A picture of home to every soldier overseas"--at
least to every Newark soldier in service.

While the members of the Camera Club were prompted solely by a desire to
serve, it was not long before there came responses in the form of letters
of gratitude from the soldier boys that heartened them to renewed
activity.  The written messages frequently attested that the pictures of
the home folks sent by the Camera Club members were the only ones that had
reached foreign shores.

As a stepping stone to something even greater, we have organized the
Associated Camera Clubs of America, with a view to linking the activities
of camera clubs and societies, the end to be sought being the creating of
greater interest in exhibitions, and interchanges of lantern slides and
prints. The prime object, of course, is to promote and cultivate the
art-sense through the science of photography.

If a camera club does not exist in the community in which the reader
resides, lend your services to the formation of one.  The members of the
Associated Camera Clubs of America stand ready to do their utmost to
assist an infant organization on its way to success.

PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPNY IN MAINE


_By _FRANCIS O. LIBBY

Maine, the State of forest and lakes, does not hold the position in
pictorial photography warranted by her natural beauties.  It would not be
unreasonable, considering the advantages of the land and the opportunities
offered by the varying atmospheric conditions, particularly along the
coast, to expect that there would be many pictorialists of high rank in
the State; but it is a lamentable fact that there are not.  After all, the
making of pictures with a camera is to a large extent a matter of
education and training--not so much in the way of overcoming the technical
difficulties of the medium, though of course this must be learned too, but
in such vital matters as composition, choice of subject matter, unity,
simplicity, and the like.  Then, given the vision, the pictorial
photographer is born.

This preliminary training and the art education of the beginner can best
be obtained in clubs; and in Maine the two centers of photographic
activity are Portland and Bangor, in both of which cities are active
camera clubs, each affiliated with the local art society and each holding
annual exhibitions in the spring of the year, at which workers from all
parts of the country show their pictures.  During the war these clubs have
been doing little more than marking time, but now that at last days of
peace have come again, we feel that the future holds prospects of great
promise to us.  For one reason or another the men whose names were known
ten or fifteen years ago seem to have dropped out and their places are
being filled by new blood, men with high ideals and aspirations, who are
not content merely with reproducing, by means of their cameras, pretty
scenes and places, but who believe that photography is capable of much
more--of showing not only the physical facts, but the very spirit of nature
herself--a true impressionism; and it is the task of these men to place
Maine in the position she should hold in pictorial work.

During the past year much has been accomplished by a very few men, and
through these men Maine has been represented at all the largest and best
salons, not only in this country and Canada, but also in England at the
London Salon.  Prints by the multiple gum process are favored by some of
the Portland workers, but the use of this process as a medium of
expression is limited to a few men, and the most of the large prints
produced are enlargements on bromide paper, as is probably the case
generally throughout the country.  This is perhaps somewhat to be
regretted, for although bromide paper is capable of producing very fine
prints when the subject is exactly adapted to it, still it does not permit
of the personal control afforded by some of the other processes, and of
course this is a handicap to the pictorial worker.

As before stated, the pictorial output of the State during the past year
has been limited to the work of a few men, but this condition is not going
to continue for long.  The clubs and societies are bending every effort
toward the encouragement of the new workers, and already some very
creditable work has been produced, and the coming year should see a worthy
showing from Maine at all the salons.

PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY IN MASSACHUSETTS


_By_ DWIGHT A. DAVIS

In Massachusetts, as in other parts of the country, war-time activities
interfered to a noticeable extent with the cause of pictorial photography.
The interference was perhaps less marked than in some other sections,
where more of the prominent workers were actively engaged at the front.
The difficulty in securing materials, amounting now and then to utter
impossibility, was, however, the same, and there was the same falling off
in enthusiasm, due to the demands on one's heart and pocketbook from
across the sea.  In this crisis organized effort might have been
especially helpful, but it is just in this respect that Massachusetts has
always been weak.  Her workers have been widely scattered from the
Berkshires to the shore, and such local clubs as have here and there
existed have not been deeply or permanently influential.  In Boston there
was the once famous Photo Clan, with Garo, Eicheim, and Schuman as its
leading spirits, but that has long since ceased to be an active force.  On
the other hand, the Boston Young Men's Christian Union Camera Club and the
Boston Society of Arts and Crafts have lately come into new prominence
through their efforts to stimulate interest and afford frequent
opportunities to view exhibitions of the best in photographic art.  The
former held, during the past winter, excellent one-man exhibits, in which
work of such prominent pictorialists as John Paul Edwards, Dr. Rupert
Lovejoy, Dwight A. Davis, Francis O. Libby, John H. Garo, Edward H.
Weston, and Arthur Hammond was shown.

But, in spite of these various influences, the workers of Massachusetts
for the most part pursue solitary ways, with little enough--all too little,
some would say--of the advantages that come from intimate association.
There is, however, another side of the shield.  It is at least
questionable whether such strongly marked personality as appears in the
work of Seeley, Garo, Davis, Hammond, Eicheim, Buttler, the Allen sisters,
and a dozen others who might be mentioned, would be possible if the
workers of this section were under the closely dominating influence of a
centralized group, itself dominated by a single individual of exceptional
powers.  Such a state of affairs has sometimes been observed in other
parts of the country, and the results have not always been advantageous to
the interests of the individual workers.  Under such conditions as exist
in Massachusetts, the Pictorial Photographers of America has come as a
boon, since it affords just the kind of stimulus most needed.
Massachusetts has been swift to avail herself of the advantages thus
offered.  At the recent exhibition of the work of New England and New
Jersey pictorialists, held in New York, Massachusetts was represented by
16 out of a total of 27 exhibitors, with 64 out of a total of 107 prints--a
showing decidedly creditable to the old Bay State.

PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPKY IN MARYLAND


_By_ H. R. NEESON

The progress of pictorial photography in Maryland is to be ascertained by
an examination of the progress of the amateur in Baltimore, for aside from
the local exhibitions we have no record of anything done in the State.
While this condition is regrettable and hard to comprehend in an
art-loving center of such population, there is none the less an
improvement over former times.

The shops and the "finishers" have prospered, while the club--the old
organization in which the reason of being has been lost in a maze of
constitutional amendments, by-laws, and such like red tape--has declined in
influence and popularity.  In the world at large, pictorial photography
has grown amazingly.  This has led to a more pronounced line of
demarkation between the dilettante and the intelligent worker of
appreciation, with the balance of influence inclining strongly to the
latter.  In Maryland there has been an upheaval, a photographic
revolution, so to speak, and out of the wreckage has sprung the
Photographic Guild of Baltimore, which has done more to put Maryland
photographically to the fore in its five years of activity than had been
done in all the years previous.  It was due almost entirely to Guilders
that Maryland stood fourth at the recent Pittsburgh Salon.  Two
prerequisites to membership in the Guild are ability in keeping with the
highest standards and _productiveness_, as a consequence of which it has
only six members, who may be said to comprise the representative
pictorialists of the State.

For the past four years there has been an annual exhibition under the
auspices of the Guild at the Peabody Gallery, each well attended by the
art-loving public, with marked enthusiasm for what is being done with the
process.  A feature of the Guild exhibitions, beginning with the 1919
portfolio recently hung, is the invited work of out-of-town amateurs,
which is giving Baltimoreans a wider and better knowledge. While this
exhibition has not assumed salon proportions, it will in a measure bring
the salons to Baltimore if help in the way of prints from outside is
forthcoming, as we hope and believe will be the case.

On the whole, it may be truly said that the flexibility and responsiveness
of the photographic process have been sufficiently demonstrated to fix it
firmly among the art mediums.

MIDDLE WEST ACTIVITIES AND THE PITTSBURGH SALON


_By_ W. H. PORTERFIELD

Any article describing the activity in pictorial photography in the United
States since 1914 must include a history of the work of the Pittsburgh
Salon, and that has been very thoroughly covered in magazine articles
immediately succeeding the close of each salon.

At the outbreak of the war, the thoughts and energies of many of our
foremost workers were directed toward other fields, and those who still
practiced the work for the art side of it did so under difficulties.

The governmental restrictions placed on the use of the camera in ports and
about all public buildings, and in many sections of nearly every city,
naturally had a tendency to discourage workers, but in spite of all the
obstacles in the path of the art photographer the years have not been
barren.

Some of the older societies have all but ceased to exist, if one can judge
by their contributions to the salons.

Each year has witnessed new names among the exhibitors at Pittsburgh, and
to an already formidable list there are annually added more than enough
names to fill the vacancies caused by the dropping of former members who
have failed to retain their membership due to non-compliance with the
rules which automatically eliminate inactives.

After six years of unprecedented success it may safely be said that the
Pittsburgh Salon has become a permanent fixture in the world of
photographic art and has unquestionably rendered a most valuable service
in keeping alive the exhibition spirit.

Mention should also be made of the good work done by the Chicago
Photo-Fellows, the Buffalo Camera Club, the Photographic Guild of
Baltimore, and the Photographic Section of the Pittsburgh Academy of Fine
Arts, each one composed of enthusiasts, who loyally support the American
and London Salons as well as being active workers in the Pictorial
Photographers of America.

These societies have been continually engaged in the promotion of
inter-club exhibitions as well as in encouraging the circulation of work
of individual members.

As an educational feature the club interchange has no equal.

PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE FAR WEST


_By_ JOHN PAUL EDWARDS

The progress of pictorial photography in the Far West can be aptly
compared with the settlement and growth of this big new country itself.
We have had our pictorial pioneers, as it were--our hard-working,
enthusiastic, rather crude first settlers in the art; now we have come to
the stage of permanent abode, with traditions, albeit young, great
enthusiasm, definite ideals, and ambitious hopes for the future.

The one great asset in the upbuilding of the West has been boundless
enthusiasm.  This characteristic trait dominates the very soul of the
Western pictorialist.  In it lies his greatest hope for the future
progress in his chosen field of art.

It is this live energy and enthusiasm which brings him out afield even
before break of day, which leads him over hill and dale, mountain and
valley, in his insatiable quest for the pictorial.  Miles are as nothing;
hunger stays him not; nor rests he at night until his potential treasures
are developed and their beauties appraised.

The purpose of this preliminary psychologic analysis is to explain the
militant attitude of the Western pictorialist in his pursuit of the art of
the camera.  His extremely prolific production, manifesting itself in
liberal contributions to the salons and exhibitions of the world
photographic, rises not from vanity but from super-enthusiasm--from the
great joy he derives in making his picture, from the creation of the
beautiful, and from the playing of the game as it is best played.

Without losing a whit of the steady enthusiasm which has brought it to its
present encouraging stage, Western pictorial photography is, nevertheless,
settling down to a more staid and intellectual plane of progress.

The broad average of quality of work is steadily improving.  Better
standards have been established.  The workers are "finding" themselves.
Enthusiasm is being beneficently tempered by increased technical skill,
and more particularly by the intellectual development of the art side of
the work.

And so the future of pictorial photography in the Far West looks
exceedingly bright.  The salon workers of the past five or ten years are
with few exceptions as keen as ever for their art, and a very talented and
numerous lot of new workers are coming to the front.

The center, in fact the stronghold, of Western pictorial photography is
undoubtedly California.  All forms of art seem to flourish mightily in
this genial clime of wondrous, colorful beauty.  A land of smiling
sunshine, of lofty snow-capped peaks, of weird trees, of golden
poppy-covered slopes, of sparkling seas--it is small wonder that the young
art of the camera should thrive so vigorously there.

There are several active foci of pictorial interest in the State.  The
most active and most promising of these centers is the Camera
Pictorialists of Los Angeles. This club, as we may call it, has a
membership of fourteen under the directorship of Louis Fleckenstein.
Every member is an active worker of ability and promise.  This group has
made an imposing representation in nearly every photographic salon of
recent years.

They are sponsors for the International Photographic Salon held annually
in the municipal art gallery of Los Angeles.  This exhibition, with two
years of success behind it, must be rated as the premier event of its kind
in the West, and, in the quality of its offerings, second to none on the
continent.

While this is the only prominent group in California organized for
strictly pictorial work, there are a great many independent workers widely
scattered about the State.  San Francisco and the bay region can claim a
score or more whose achievements have been notable.

Oregon has many enthusiastic workers and a strong club in Portland.
Washington likewise has many camera artists of talent.  Both these States
have an untold wealth of pictorial material and many keen pictorialists.
All they lack is an active leader or two to bring them to the rank they
should hold in the photographic world.

In Salt Lake City we find an active, enthusiastic and very promising group
of workers under the able leadership of Thomas O. Sheckell.  Through the
medium of an extensive series of one-man exhibitions they have brought
before the art-loving public of their city the best work of a large number
of our leading pictorialists.

One of the most interesting and auspicious developments of the year has
been the recent formation of the Pacific Coast Chapter of the Pictorial
Photographers of America.

For very logical reasons the chief activities of the parent body of the
Pictorial Photographers of America have been centered in the City of New
York.  An earnest desire to enjoy like activities right at home while
still sharing the privileges of direct affiliation with our fellows of the
Pictorial Photographers of America led to the formation of the Pacific
Coast Chapter.  The idea is still young, but the success of the chapter is
definitely assured by the strong character of the membership already
secured.  It is the purpose of the chapter to uphold strongly the purposes
and ideals of its parent body and to work continuously for the advancement
of pictorial photography in the West.  A number of interesting exhibitions
are scheduled for the near future, the most important of these being the
"All Western" exhibition, which is planned for the fall and winter of
1919-20.  The aim is to include the best pictorial photography of the
West.  It will be shown first in New York by the Pictorial Photographers
of America and then routed through some of the more representative clubs
of the East and Middle West.

The reproductions in this Annual were selected from a group of nearly 1100
photographs. Of the 100 artists whose prints are now reproduced:

36 are new workers.  16 were unknown to the judges.  32 are workers of
recent years. 16 are old workers.

A further computation shows that 56 are members of the Association, while
44 are non-members.

you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the
terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright)
agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this

forth in paragraph 1.E.8.


1.B.


"Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be used on or
associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be
bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that you can
do with most Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works even without complying
with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C below. There are
a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works if you
follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.


1.C.


The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation" or
PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an individual
work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in
the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying,
distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on
the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of
course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} mission of
promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for
keeping the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} name associated with the work. You can
easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License when you
share it without charge with others.


1.D.


The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you
can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant
state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of
your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before
downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating
derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work.
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of
any work in any country outside the United States.


1.E.


Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:


1.E.1.


The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access
to, the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License must appear prominently whenever
any copy of a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work (any work on which the phrase
"Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project Gutenberg"
is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or
distributed:


    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
    almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away
    or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License
    included with this eBook or online at http://www.gutenberg.org


1.E.2.


If an individual Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work is derived from the
public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with
permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and
distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or
charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you
must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7
or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.


1.E.3.


If an individual Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic work is posted with the
permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply
with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed
by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked to the Project
Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License for all works posted with the permission of the
copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.


1.E.4.


Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License
terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or any
other work associated with Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}.


1.E.5.


Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this electronic
work, or any part of this electronic work, without prominently displaying
the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or immediate
access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License.


1.E.6.


You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed,
marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word
processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or

on the official Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} web site (http://www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other form.
Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License as
specified in paragraph 1.E.1.


1.E.7.


Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing,

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.

electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.

exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state

shall not void the remaining provisions.

this or any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work, and (c) any Defect

           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}'s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at

  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

      General Information About Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~}, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
