GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION OF "MORMON" QUESTION.

Rarely a day passes but the keen observer can find in the columns of
sensational periodicals such captions as: "Beware of the 'Mormons,'"
"Capturing Soul-brides for Utah," "Elders of 'Mormon' Church Entice
Girls to Utah," "Sleek-haired Devils in Sheep's Clothing," "Local
Girl Kidnapped by 'Mormon,'" etc., and under such headings an array
of villifying accusations which make themselves obnoxious to thinking
people. The "Mormon" elder, according to "yellow journalism," is a
villain of the deepest dye; he is a white-slave trafficker, and is
charged with resorting to the basest practices to induce people to
espouse his creed; in fact, he is charged with almost every crime on
the calendar. And, strange to say, these charges are made by and at the
instigation of Christian ministers, so-called.

But, says the man in the street, "If these charges are all false, men
would not dare to make them!" And further, "If they are not true, why
doesn't the 'Mormon' Church as an institution prosecute the offenders?"

That is exactly the point: Are these accusations true, or are they
false? Who shall say? "Let an impartial tribunal judge," says one. Very
good: "But," says another, "whose is the prerogative to undertake such
a task?" According to Professor Anson, in his book, _The Law and Custom
of the Constitution_, "The Home Secretary is responsible for peace
and good order throughout the land by (a) exercising a control over
the elements of possible disorder, and (b) by supervising the police
forces of counties and towns." Therefore, since it is the duty of the
Home Secretary, let us leave the matter entirely in his hands and await
the outcome. Further, we will guarantee to the opposition that the
defendants will remain absolutely mute during the whole trial, so as
to eliminate the possibility of influencing the judge in favor of the
"Mormons." Further, we will concede to the affirmative the privilege of
summoning to their aid all the forensic genius in the House of Commons,
and grant them the privilege of presenting their brief in whatsoever
manner they choose.

The following are excerpts from "Parliamentary Debates (Official
Report)," published by the English Government.

On the 29th July, 1910:

"MR. PETO asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether
his attention has been called to the expulsion of Mormon 'apostles'
from Berlin on Friday last, and their departure for Rotterdam, and to
the presence of members of that body at Hungerford, Berkshire, and
whether he will take steps to prevent meetings being held to spread
their views in this country, during the Recess?

"MR. CHURCHILL: I have seen a statement in the press about the
expulsion of the Mormons from Berlin, but I have no official knowledge
of the matter, and I have no information as to the presence of members
of that body at Hungerford. I have no power to prevent the holding of
such meetings as long as they are held in conformity with the law."

On the 18th November, 1910:

"MR. FITZROY asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he is aware of
the propaganda which is being carried on all over the country by the
Mormons with a view to inducing women and young girls from English
villages to go out to America to join their community, and whether he
has taken or is taking any steps to prevent English women and girls
from being subjected to these inducements to join a community which
acts contrary to the laws of both England and the United States?

"MR. CHURCHILL: Inquiry has from time to time been made into
allegations which have reached the Home Office, but no ground for
action has been found. I am informed that polygamy is now forbidden
by the rules of the Mormon Church as well as by the law of the United
States."

On the 6th March, 1911:

"MR. ARNOLD WARD asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department
whether the attention of the Government has been called to the growing
activity in this country of Mormon missionaries from the United States;
whether he has any official information showing that young English
girls are being induced to emigrate to Utah, and if so, whether the
Government propose to take any steps to safeguard English homes from
this danger?

"MR. CHURCHILL: My attention has been called to the matter, and I am
making inquiries. I have at present no official information showing
that young girls are being induced to emigrate to Utah.

"MR. CATHCART WASON: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he has
any information that polygamy is still practised in Utah, and whether
there is any objection to the girls going there?

"MR. ARNOLD WARD: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he has
official information that the United States Senate has reported that
the leaders of the Mormon church have practised and encouraged polygamy?

"MR. CHURCHILL: I am aware that the matter is causing a great deal of
concern in certain quarters in this country. I am treating it in a
serious spirit, and looking into it very thoroughly."

Later in the same day:

"MR. HARMOOD-BANNER asked the Home Secretary if his attention has
been called to the active propaganda of Mormon principles at present
prosecuted in Liverpool and district, and whether in view of the
character of the fundamental principles, His Majesty's Government will
employ means to abate the nuisance?

"MR. CHURCHILL: I am making inquiry into this matter."

On the 19th April, 1911:

"MR. HOUSTON asked the Home Secretary whether he has any official
information showing that the German government has expelled Mormon
missionaries from any portion of German territory, and whether he
is prepared to introduce legislation to expel and exclude Mormon
missionaries from this country?

"MR. CHURCHILL: I have no official information on the point, but
inquiries are being made through the Foreign Office. I am unable
at present to make any statement as regards the second part of the
question.

"MR. HOUSTON: Is the right hon. Gentleman not aware that it is public
knowledge that the German government did, six years ago, peremptorily
expel Mormon missionaries from Germany on the grounds of their faith
being against the interests of public morality; and is he aware that as
late as last year, the twelve apostles of Mormonism who went to Germany
for purposes of propaganda were peremptorily expelled?

(Note. -- It is a matter of fact that the Twelve Apostles of
"Mormonism" have never, at any time, been in Germany, simultaneously).

"MR. CHURCHILL: I have not yet made the inquiries which are necessary.
I do not think there is any difference of opinion between us as to the
character of this propaganda."

On the 20th April, 1911:

"CAPTAIN FABER asked the Home Secretary whether his attention has been
called to the Mormon campaign, whether Mormon missionaries are making
house to house calls in Chesterfield, and offering money bribes to
girls to emigrate, and whether he contemplates any action against the
Mormons?

"MR. CHURCHILL: I am informed that tracts have been distributed at
houses in Chesterfield by Mormons, but that no instance is known to
the police of the offer of money bribes to emigrate. As I have already
stated, the whole question is receiving consideration, and if the hon.
and gallant Member has any definite information, I shall be glad if he
will communicate it to me.

"CAPTAIN FABER: Is it not possible to include Mormons in the Aliens Act?

"MR. CHURCHILL: That is a very difficult question, and if the hon. and
gallant Gentleman will look into the matter he will realize that it is
not so simple as it seems at first sight.

"CAPTAIN FABER: Is it not the fact that no law can touch them unless
they really practice polygamy in this country?

"MR. CHURCHILL: There is very wide toleration of opinion in this
country, and it is only when those opinions merge into action contrary
to the law that the law can step in.

"MR. HOUSTON: Has the right hon. Gentleman received any information
from the Foreign Office with regard to the expulsion of Mormons from
Germany?

"MR. CHURCHILL: They can do a great many things by police action in
Germany which we cannot do in this country, and to do which I do not
propose to ask the House to give me powers."

On the 25th April, 1911:

"MR. HOUSTON asked the Home Secretary whether he has yet received any
information from His Majesty's Ambassador at Berlin as to the expulsion
of Mormon missionaries from Germany, and if not, whether he can state
when he expects to receive information?

"MR. CHURCHILL: No information on the point has yet been received from
His Majesty's Ambassador at Berlin, but the matter is being carried
forward, and I expect to learn at a very early date the result of the
inquiries which are being made.

"MR. HOUSTON: Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that in various parts
of the country, notably in the North, the spirit and temper of the
people is rapidly rising, and may result in rioting and conflict with
the police unless prompt steps are taken?

"MR. SPEAKER: That does not arise out of a question about Mormonism in
Germany."

On the 8th May, 1911:

"MR. HOUSTON asked the Home Secretary whether he has yet received
any reply from the British Ambassador at Berlin as to the expulsion
of Mormon missionaries from Germany; if so, will he state the nature
of the reply; if the German Government have so dealt with Mormon
missionaries in Germany, does he propose to adopt similar measures
in Great Britain; or, if not, whether he will introduce legislation
prohibiting Mormon propaganda in Great Britain, and the nature of such
legislation?

"MR. CHURCHILL: A reply has now been received from the British
Ambassador at Berlin to the effect that no special legislative measures
for prohibiting or restricting the Mormon propaganda have been adopted
in Germany. Steps are taken by the police to expel any foreign members
of the sect who may render themselves obnoxious in any way, but, as I
have already stated in this House, the police in Germany have a great
many powers that are not possessed by the police in this country. I am
not yet in a position to state the full result of my inquiries with
regard to Mormon propaganda in this country and America, but I have not
so far discovered any ground for legislative action in the matter.

"MR. HOUSTON: Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the hostility to
this propaganda is growing rapidly in this country, and that in some
instances benches of magistrates are so sympathetic with the rioters
that they have dismissed the complaints against them made by the police?

"MR. CHURCHILL: I think anything in the nature of rowdyism and mob
action ought to be sternly suppressed by those responsible for the
maintenance of the peace."

From the above citations it is obvious that the chief indictment
against the "Mormon" elder in Great Britain is that he is bribing and
secretly inducing English girls and women to emigrate to Utah for
immoral purposes. It is interesting to note, however, what the law
has to say in this regard, and I therefore refer to The Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1885 (48 and 49 Vict., chapter 69, Sec. 2), which says:

"Any person who procures or attempts to procure any woman or girl
to leave her usual place of abode in the United Kingdom (such place
not being a brothel), with intent that she may, for the purposes
of prostitution, become an inmate of a brothel within or without
the Queen's dominions, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being
convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be
imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without hard
labor."

Referring to this identical clause The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1912
(2 and 3 Geo. 5, chapter 20, Sec. 1), says:

"A constable may take into custody without a warrant, any person
whom he shall have good cause to suspect of having committed, or of
attempting to commit, any offence against section two of the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1885 (which relates to procuration and attempted
procuration)."

Is it not reasonable to suppose, therefore, that if there existed an
atom of truth in the indictment, that the laws just quoted and others
would have been used in the suppression of the "Mormon" propaganda in
this country? The fact is, on the other hand, that during the 77 years
that the "Mormon" elder has proselyted in the British Isles not a
single case has been proved nor has one yet arisen.

The fact that no mention of the "Mormon" question has been made in the
House of Commons since the 8th of May, 1911, until the present time,
proves that Mr. Churchill's statement on that date was accepted as
final. But since, on the other hand, his conclusion was preceded by
the clause, "I am not yet in a position to state the full result of my
inquiries," there still remained the possibility of the appearance of
further evidence which might modify this conclusion. With this idea in
view the following letter was penned:

Durham House,

295 Edge Lane, Liverpool,

May 14th, 1914.

Sir:

On the 8th of May, 1911, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs,
Mr. Winston Churchill, made the following statement in the House of
Commons: "I am not yet in a position to state the full result of my
inquiries with regard to Mormon propaganda in this country and America,
but I have not so far discovered any ground for legislative action in
the matter."

I am desirous of ascertaining the conclusions drawn, or the result of
the inquiries on the "Mormon" question, spoken of above, and should
therefore deem it a favor to receive an official copy of same.

In the event that this not available, could the records containing such
facts be viewed by appointment, and could citations be made to some
reliable periodical containing the facts in the case?

Thanking you in anticipation of this favor, and apologizing for this
intrusion upon your valuable time,

I am, Sir,

Yours sincerely,

(Signed) ARTHUR L. BEELEY.

RT. HON. REGINALD MCKENNA, K.C.,

Home Office,

Whitehall,

London, S.W.

The following letter was received in reply:

Home Office,

Whitehall,

22nd May, 1914.

Sir,

In reply to your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the
Mormon propaganda in this country and in America, I am directed by the
Secretary of State to say that no official report has been published,
but that the extensive enquiries which were made did not reveal any
grounds for legislative action.

The Secretary of State regrets that it would be contrary to practice
to accede to your request to be allowed to see the official records
dealing with this matter.

I am, Sir,

Your obedient Servant,

(Signed) A.J. EAGLESTON.

The only difference between Mr. Churchill's conclusion of May 8th,
1911, and the statement in the letter of May 22nd, 1914, is the
inclusion in the latter of the phrase "extensive inquiries." Referring
again to the prescribed powers of the Secretary of State, Professor
Alpheus Todd in his treatise, _Parliamentary Government in England_,
says: "In addition to his prescribed police powers, large statutory
authority has been assigned to the Home Secretary. He has a direct
controlling power over the administration of justice and police in all
the municipal boroughs."

It is apparent, therefore, that the "extensive enquiries" would be
made through the very effective channels at the disposal of the Home
Secretary, viz., the different police forces. Now, it is an absolute
fact, and has later become common knowledge, that the various police
forces throughout the United Kingdom were instructed to make full
inquiries into these allegations and to report their findings to the
Home Office. The fact that eight different members of Parliament, each
representing different constituencies, brought the matter before the
attention of the House of Commons, is further proof that the inquiries
would be thorough and universal, i.e., not confined to any one part
of the country. The fact that the question was debated eight times
within nine months on the floor of the House of Commons is further
evidence that the question had become an aggravated one and would be
dealt with "very thoroughly," as Mr. Churchill promised. Again, the
fact, as stated by Mr. Churchill on the 18th of November, 1911, that
the allegations which reached the Home Office were inquired into and no
ground for action found, is an additional reason for believing that the
inquiries would be thorough-going. In this connection let it be borne
in mind that Mr. Churchill, on the 20th April, 1911, stated that "the
whole question is receiving consideration," and on the 6th of March,
1911, said: "I am treating it in a serious spirit, and looking into it
very thoroughly."

Now, then, in the light of these facts, the conclusion drawn by Mr.
Churchill in May, 1911, and the declaration of the Home Secretary, so
recent as May 22nd, 1914, to the effect "that the extensive inquiries
which were made did not reveal any grounds for legislative action,"
prove conclusively that such allegations are untrue. And what is very
remarkable is the fact that Mr. Winston Churchill made this statement
and reached this conclusion in spite of himself, for on the 19th
of April, 1911, he implied that he himself regarded the "Mormon"
propaganda as dangerous. Now, then, since as Professor Todd further
points out, that "He (the Home Secretary) himself is a magistrate, and
exercises a power to examine and commit for trial persons charged with
offenses against the State," is it not only reasonable to suppose that
in the exercise of this power and duty he would have committed for
trial and punished more rigorously any and all offenders; and further,
is not the argument also tenable that he undoubtedly would have
proposed and introduced "effective legislation"?

The judge has rendered his decision, dear reader. The court of last
appeal, after "extensive inquiries," has awarded in favor of the silent
defendants. The "Mormon" elder is exonerated, and the falsifier, in
spite of his prejudice, calumny and invective, has been ignominiously
defeated.

The question logically rises itself here: What can be said of our
accusers who persist in the circulation of these charges, who reject
the findings of their own Government, and thereby insult it by tacitly
implying that the British Government is aiding, abetting and conniving
at the alleged infamous practices of the "Mormon" Church? Such a man is
either an ignoramus or a prevaricator of the first water, and we care
not which horn of the dilemma he chooses.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
