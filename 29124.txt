INTRODUCTION


Early in the present year Mr. Thos. J. Wise discovered among the
miscellaneous MSS. of Borrow a fragment which proved to be part of a
version of Oehlenschlager's _Gold Horns_.  His attention being drawn to
the fact, hitherto unknown, that Borrow had translated this famous poem,
he sought for, and presently found, a complete MS. of the poem, and from
this copy the present text has been printed.  The paper on which it is
written is watermarked 1824, and it is probable that the version was
composed in 1826.  The hand-writing coincides with that of several of the
pieces included in the _Romantic Ballads_ of that year, and there can be
little doubt that Borrow intended _The Gold Horns_ for that volume, and
rejected it at last.  He was conscious, perhaps, that his hand had lacked
the skill needful to reproduce a lyric the melody of which would have
taxed the powers of Coleridge or of Shelley.  Nevertheless, his attempt
seems worthy of preservation.

_The Gold Horns_ marks one of the most important stages in the history of
Scandinavian literature.  It is the earliest, and the freshest, specimen
of the Romantic Revival in its definite form.  In this way, it takes in
Danish poetry a place analogous to that taken by _The Ancient Mariner_ in
English poetry.

The story of the events which led to the composition of _The Gold Horns_
is told independently, by Steffens and by Oehlenschlager in their
respective Memoirs, and the two accounts tally completely.  Adam Gottlob
Oehlenschlager (1779-1850), the greatest poet whom the North of Europe
has produced, had already attracted considerable renown and even profit
by his writings, which were in the classico-sentimental manner of the
late 18th century, when, in the summer of 1802, the young Norwegian
philosopher, Henrik Steffens, arrived in Copenhagen from Germany, where
he had imbibed the new romantic ideas.  He began to give lectures on
aesthetics, and these awakened a turmoil of opposition.  Among those who
heard him, no one was more scandalised than Oehlenschlager, then in his
twenty-third year.  He was not acquainted with Steffens, but in the
course of the autumn they happened to meet at a restaurant in Copenhagen,
when they instantly experienced a violent mutual attraction.  Steffens
has described how deep an impression was made upon him by the handsome
head, flashing eyes, and graceful vivacity of the poet, while
Oehlenschlager bears witness to being no less fascinated by the gravity
and enthusiasm of the philosopher.  The new friends found it impossible
to part, and sixteen hours had gone by, and 3 a.m. had struck, before
Oehlenschlager could tear himself away from the company of Steffens.

He scarcely slept that night, and rose in a condition of bewilderment and
rapture.  His first act, after breakfast, was to destroy a whole volume
of his own MS. poetry, which was ready for press, and for which a
publisher had promised him a handsome sum of money.  His next was to sit
down and write _The Gold Horns_, a manifesto of his complete conversion
to the principles of romanticism.  Later in the day he presented himself
again at Steffens' lodgings, bringing the lyric with him, "to prove," as
he says, "to Steffens that I was a poet at last beyond all doubt or
question."  His new friend received him with solemn exultation.  "Now you
are indeed a poet," he said, and folded him in his arms.  The conversion
of Oehlenschlager to romanticism meant the conquest of Danish literature
by the new order of thought.

Oehlenschlager has explained what it was that suggested to him the
leading idea of his poem.  Two antique horns of gold, discovered some
time before in the bogs of Slesvig, had been recently stolen from the
national collection at Rosenborg, and the thieves had melted down the
inestimable treasures.  Oehlenschlager treats these horns as the reward
for genuine antiquarian enthusiasm, shown in a sincere and tender passion
for the ancient relics of Scandinavian history.  From a generation
unworthy to appreciate them, the _Horns_ had been withdrawn, to be
mysteriously restored at the due romantic hour.  He was, when he came
under the influence of Steffens, absolutely ripe for conversion, filled
with the results of his Icelandic studies, and with an imagination
redolent of _Edda_ and the Sagas.  To this inflammable material, Henrik
Steffens merely laid the torch of his intelligence.

It is impossible to pretend that Borrow has caught the enchanting beauty
and delicacy of the Danish poem.  But he has made a gallant effort to
reproduce the form and language of Oehlenschlager, and we have thought it
not without interest to print opposite his version the whole of the
original Danish.

GULDHORNENE {10}                    THE GOLD HORNS

De higer og soger                   Upon the pages
I gamle Boger,                      Of the olden ages,
I oplukte Hoie,                     And in hills where are lying
Med speidende Oie,                  The dead, they are prying;
Paa Svaerd og Skjolde,              On armour rusty,
I mulne Volde,                      In ruins musty,
Paa Runestene,                      On Rune-stones jumbled,
Blandt smuldnede Bene.              With bones long crumbled.

Oldtids Bedrifter                   Eld's deeds, through guesses
Anede trylle,                       Beheld, are delighting,
Men i Mulm de sig hylle,            But mist possesses
De gamle Skrifter.                  The ancient writing.
Blikket stirrer,                    The eye-ball fixed is,
Sig Tanken forvirrer,               The thought perplexed is;
I Taage de famle.                   In darkness they're groping
"I gamle, gamle,                    Their mouths they're op'ing:
Forsvundne Dage!                    "Ye days long past,
Da det straalte paa Jorden,         When the North was uplighted,
Da Osten var i Norden,              And with earth heav'n united,
Giver Glimt tilbage!"               A glimpse back cast."

Skyen suser,                        The clouds are bustling,
Natten bryser,                      The night blasts rustling,
Gravhoien sukker,                   Sighs are breaking,
Rosen sig lukker.                   From grave-hills quaking,
De sig mode, de sig mode,           The regions were under
De forklarede Hoie,                 Thunder.
Kampfarvede, rode,                  Of the mighty and daring,
Med Stjerneglands i Oie.            The ghosts there muster,
                                    Stains of war bearing,
                                    In their eye star lustre.

"I, som rave iblinde,               "Ye who blind are straying,
Skal finde                          And praying,
Et aeldgammelt Minde,               Shall an ag'd relic meet,
Der skal komme og svinde!           Which shall come and shall fleet,
Dets gyldne Sider                   Its red sides golden,
Skal Praeget baere,                 The stamp displaying
Afaeldste Tider.                    Of the times most olden.

Af det kan I laere,                 That shall give ye a notion
Med andagtsfuld AEre                To hold in devotion
I vor Gave belonne!                 Our gift, is your duty!
Det skjonneste Skjonne,             A maiden, of beauty
En Mo                               Most rare.
Skal Helligdommen finde!"           Shall find the token!"

Saa sjunge de og svinde,            They vanished; this spoken
Lufttonerne doe.                    Their tones die in air.

Hrymfaxe, den sorte,                Black Hrymfax, weary,
Puster og dukker                    Panteth and bloweth,
Og i Havet sig begraver;            And in sea himself burieth;
Morgenens Porte                     Belling, cheery,
Delling oplukker,                   Morn's gates ope throweth;
Og Skinfaxe traver                  Forth Skinfax hurrieth,
I straalende Lue                    On heaven's bridge prancing,
Paa Himmelens Bue.                  And with lustre glancing.

Og Fuglene synge;                   The little birds quaver,
Dugperler bade                      Pearls from night's weeping;
Blomsterblade,                      The flowers are steeping
Som Vindene gynge;                  In the winds which waver;
Og med svaevende Fjed               To the meadows, fleet
En Mo hendandser                    A maiden boundeth;
Til Marken afsted.                  Violet fillet neat
Violer hende krandser,              Her brows surroundeth;
Hendes Rosenkind braender,          Her cheeks are glowing,
Hun har Liljehaender;               Lilly hands she's showing;
Let som et Hind,                    Light as a hind,
Med muntert Sind                    With sportive mind
Hun svaever og smiler;              She smiling frisketh.
Og som hun iler                     And as on she whisketh,
Og paa Elskov grubler,              And thinks on her lover,
Hun snubler--                       She trips something over;
Og stirrer og skuer                 And, her eyes declining,
Gyldne Luer                         Beholds a shining,
Og rodmer og baever                 And red'neth and shaketh,
Og skjaelvende haever               And trembling uptaketh
Med undrende Aand                   With wondering sprite
Udaf sorten Muld                    From the dingy mould,
Med snehvide Haand,                 With hand snow-white,
Det rode Guld.                      The ruddy gold.
En sagte Torden                     A gentle thunder
Dundrer;                            Pealeth;
Hele Norden                         The whole North wonder
Undrer.                             Feeleth.

Og hen de stimle                    Forth rush with gabble
I store Vrimle;                     A countless rabble;
De grave, de soge                   The earth they're upturning,
Skatten at foroge.                  For the treasure burning.
Men intet Guld!                     But there's no gold!
Deres Haab har bedraget:            Their hope is mistaken;
De see kun det Muld,                They see but the mould,
Hvoraf det er taget.                From whence it is taken.

Et Sekel svinder!                   An age by rolleth.

Over Klippetinder                   Again it howleth
Det atter bruser.                   O'er the tops of the mountains.
Stormens Sluser                     Of the rain the fountains
Bryde med Vaelde                    Burst with fury;
Over Norges Fjelde                  The spirits of glory
Til Danmarks Dale.                  From Norge's highlands,
I Skyernes Sale                     To Denmark's islands,
De forklarede Gamle                 In the halls of ether
Sig atter samle.                    Again meet together.

"For de sjeldne Faa,                "For the few there below
Som vor Gave forstaae,              Who our gift's worth know,

Men hvis Sjaele sig haeve           And whose souls are soaring

Paa Helligdommens Sider:            From the relic's sides darted:
For _dem_ lyder atter vort Bliv.    For them our Be once more shall
                                    ring.

"Naturens Son,                      "Nature's son, whose name

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
