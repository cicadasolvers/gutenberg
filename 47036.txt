WHEN YOU ASK WHY I DWELL HERE DOCILE AMONG THE FAR GREEN HILLS, I LAUGH
IN MY HEART. MY HEART IS HAPPY.

THE PEACH-BLOSSOM WATCHES THE RIVER RUNNING BUT REMAINS CONTENT. THERE
IS A BETTER HEAVEN AND EARTH THAN THE BUSY WORLD OF MEN.

                           I HAVE SEEN A ROAD


I HAVE SEEN A ROAD THAT WANDERS IN GREEN SHADE, THAT RUNS THROUGH SWEET
FIELDS OF FLOWERS. MY EYES HAVE TRAVELED THERE, AND JOURNEYED FAR ALONG
THAT COOL FINE ROAD.

BUT I WILL NEVER REALLY WALK THAT ROAD; IT DOES NOT REALLY LEAD TO WHERE
SHE LIVES.

WHEN SHE WAS BORN, THEY BOUND HER LITTLE FEET WITH LEATHER BANDS; MY
BELOVED NEVER WALKS THE ROAD OF SHADE AND FLOWERS.

WHEN SHE WAS BORN, THEY BOUND HER LITTLE HEART WITH LEATHER BANDS; MY
BELOVED NEVER LISTENS TO MY SONG.

FADED NARCISSUS, FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER TO TIENOUAN.... IF YOU SEE
THERE A YOUNG GIRL DREAMING, UNDER A CINNAMON TREE THAT HAS BLOSSOMED
TWICE SINCE WE EMBRACED, TELL HER ... I SMELL A FRESH CARNATION TO
REMEMBER HER PERFUME.

YOU RODE A YELLOW HORSE, I RODE A WHITE ONE.... HORSES TWO COLORS, BUT
OUR BOYISH HEARTS WERE ONE.

WE RODE TOGETHER THROUGH THE COUNTRY, A PAIR OF PRANCING PEACOCKS ...
OUR JEWELED LONG SWORDS SHINING IN THE SUN, OUR TALL HEADDRESSES
SCARLET, AND OUR PRECIOUS FURS WORTH THOUSANDS ... WE WERE GUESTS OF ALL
FIVE ORDERS OF NOBILITY.

NOW, MY FIERCE TIGER FRIEND HAS CRASHED INTO A TRAP. IT IS FINE TO FACE
FATE NOBLY ... BUT IF MY BRAVE COMRADE IS IN DANGER, WHAT PLEASURE CAN I
FIND IN BEING FREE AND HAPPY?

A WINDOW OPENS AND A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN LOOKS OUT. HER EYES ARE WET AS SHE
LOOKS AT GRASS TURNING GREEN BEFORE HER HOUSE, AT WILLOWS IN NEW LEAF
ALONG THE RIVER. IN TIMES PAST, WHEN SHE LOOKED OUT, SHE SANG.

WHEN YOU OWN A TREASURE YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO KEEP IT. MY FRIEND, YOURS
HAS TWO BEAUTIFUL LEGS: BE CAREFUL, OR IT WILL RUN AWAY!

HERE, DAY AND NIGHT, THE PRETTIEST WOMEN OF THE EMPIRE ARE DANCING ...
SONGS AND LAUGHTER ECHO FROM THE GOLDEN SCREENS.

WHEN ALL THE OTHERS ARE OVERCOME WITH DRINKING, I PUT DOWN MY WINE. I
TAKE MY BRUSH, I WET THE GOLDEN INK, AND I WRITE SAD POEMS WITH SWAYING
CHARACTERS THAT LOOK LIKE THESE ROSY BODIES STREWN ON A MARBLE FLOOR.

THIS LAKE AT KUEN-MING, HOW WONDROUS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF HAN! THEN IT
FLOATED A PARADE OF PROUD WAR-JUNKS GAY WITH FLAGS ... NOW IT IS ONLY A
BARE MIRROR AT NIGHT FOR THE SPINNING BOY ... THAT STAR-BOY WHO DOES NOT
FLEE FROM COLD.

BLACK SEED-PODS FROM THE KOUMI BLOW ON IT NOW. THERE ARE LILIES AND
LOTUS-FLOWERS TOO ... BUT SOON THE NORTH WIND WILL RIP AWAY THEIR
LEAVES.

AND I WILL BE ALONE WITH MY UNHAPPINESS.

                         REMEMBER TO WEAR THEM


A SHADOW ON THE WINDOW-SCREEN.... WHO COMES GATHERING MY FLOWERS? SHE
MAY PICK THEM IF SHE WILL, BUT WHAT WILL SHE DO WITH THEM?

THE BEST SPRAYS ARE THERE BENEATH THE EAVES. PICK MORE OF THESE ... AND
REMEMBER, YOU WHO GATHER FLOWERS, WEAR THEM IN YOUR HAIR.

                               WILD GEESE


FAR IN THE NORTHWEST STANDS A HOUSE, HIGH ITS TOWER IN THE CLOUDS.
EMBROIDERED CURTAINS ARE AT THE WINDOWS. THE TOWER RISES IN THREE STEPS,
AND FROM THE TOWER FLOATS A SONG, A SAD SONG WITH A SAD LUTE PLAYING
BESIDE IT. WHO CAN THE SINGER BE?

SURELY IT IS SHE WHO HAS NO HUSBAND LEFT TO HER, NO FATHER LEFT, NO
CHILD. HER SONG FOLLOWS THE WIND; IT RISES AND FALLS. WITH THE SINGING,
SOBBING ... GRIEF IS VICTOR OVER HER STRONG WILL.

SHE DOES NOT SORROW THAT HER LIFE IS SAD, BUT THAT SO FEW CAN UNDERSTAND
THE SORROW IN HER SONG. O, TO FLY LIKE THOSE TWO WILD GEESE, RISING WITH
BEATING WINGS!

WITH THIS I SEND A MIRROR ... IT IS PURE ROUND AND IT IS CLEAR WHITE, TO
REMIND YOU OF THE MOON WE GAZED AT WHEN WE WERE LAST TOGETHER IN THE
GARDEN.

MAY IT ALWAYS STAY WITH YOU, AND MAY IT STIR SWEET MEMORIES.

BUT I KNOW: BY AUTUMN YOU WILL CAST IT ASIDE FOR SOMETHING NEW, AS YOU
HAVE CAST ASIDE ITS LOVING SENDER.

WHEN THE SWALLOWS RETURNED LAST YEAR THEY MADE THEIR NEST IN THE
EMBROIDERY ROOM. THEY GATHERED CLAY FROM THE FLOWER-GARDEN, AND
SCATTERED DUST OVER HARP AND BOOKS.

WHEN THE SWALLOWS RETURNED THIS YEAR, NO ONE HEARD THEIR TWITTERING
SPEECH. SHE WHO HAD ROLLED UP THE SCREEN FOR THEM WAS THERE NO MORE....
IN THE AMBER TWILIGHT A SOFT-PATTERING RAIN.

IN A TINY GROVE WITH FLOWERS EVERYWHERE, YOUNG GIRLS OF DAYS GONE BY SIT
LOOKING IN THEIR MIRRORS.

THEY SAY: "SOMETIMES WE THINK THAT WE HAVE GROWN OLD, THAT OUR HAIR IS
WHITE AND OUR EYES NO LONGER CLEAR AS THE NEW MOON.... BUT IT IS NOT
TRUE! OUR MIRRORS ARE BEWITCHED WITH WINTER, AND THEY LIE! IT IS THE
MIRRORS THAT MAKE OUR HAIR LIKE SNOW AND WRINKLE OUR YOUNG FACES! BUT
WICKED WINTER CAN BEWITCH OUR MIRRORS ONLY, NOT OURSELVES.... FOREVER,
WE ARE UNCHANGED."

HERE IS THE LITTLE LAKE, HERE THE LITTLE PAVILION OF WHITE PORCELAIN.
THE TINY JADE BRIDGE CURVES ... THE BACK OF A CROUCHING LION.

BOON COMPANIONS GATHER IN THE MINIATURE HALL. THEY CHATTER AND DRINK
WINE.... THEY STARE AT THE FLICKERING REFLECTIONS OF PEONIES THAT LINE
THE BANK. SOME OF THE COMPANIONS, LONG SLEEVES PUSHED BACK, CAPS LOW
OVER EYES, ARE WRITING POEMS.

THE ARCH OF THE BRIDGE IS A CRESCENT MOON.... THE REFLECTED PEONIES A
COMPANY OF DANCING GIRLS.

LEAN DOWN TO PICK WHITE LOTUS LILIES.

FIERCE DESIRE PULLS ME.... I YEARN TO TELL THEM OF MY PASSION. ALAS, MY
BOAT FLOATS AWAY AT MERCY OF THE MOVING CURRENT. MY HEART LOOKS BACK IN
SADNESS.

FIELD OF SNOW, THE MOONLIGHT IS LIKE FROST ALONG THE CITY-WALL. SOMEONE
SOMEWHERE PLAYING ON HIS FLUTE HAS MADE THE NORTHERN SOLDIERS HOMESICK
ALL NIGHT LONG.

HIGH ON A HILL, LOOKING DOWN ON THE WINDY LAKE. SEE: A LITTLE ROCKING
BOAT, STORM-TOSSED LIKE OUR LIFE TOGETHER. NOW MIST HAS HIDDEN BOAT AND
JOURNEY.

OVER THE MIST THE SUN SETS FAR OFF IN HEAVEN. ONLY HILLS ARE RED: FIELD,
HOLLOW AND LAKE ARE BLUE WITH SHADOW.

NOW ISLANDS IN THE LAKE ARE BLACK PEARLS SET IN AMETHYST. NOW THAT
WOODED HILL, A HEAD OF WAVING WOMAN'S HAIR, IS BLACK. AND SEE, A
CRESCENT COMB OF SILVER MOON.

SAD AND HAPPY, I PICK UP MY LUTE AND SING UNTIL THE STARS GROW PALE.

I AM OLD AND I AM BORED. I WAS NEVER VERY WISE AND MY MIND HAS NEVER
WALKED MUCH FURTHER THAN MY FEET. ONLY MY FOREST, MY FOREST ... I GO
BACK AND BACK TO WANDER THERE.

THERE BLUE FINGERS OF THE MOON STILL PLAY ON MY OLD LUTE. THERE WIND
SCATTERS CLOUDS AND COMES DOWN TO FLUTTER MY ROBE.

YOU ASK ME WHAT IS THE BEST HAPPINESS OF ALL? IN THE FOREST IT IS SWEET
TO HEAR A GIRL SINGING ON THE PATH, AFTER SHE HAS STOPPED TO ASK HER
WAY, AND THANKED YOU WITH A SMILE.

AFTER SUNSET IN THE MOUNTAINS, I WILL PUT ON MY BLUE ROBE WITH LONG
SLEEVES, AND GO OUT TO SLEEP AMONG THE BAMBOOS THAT SHE LOVED.

                         THE ASHES OF MY HOUSE


WHEN I RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE I HAD BEEN A HAPPY CHILD ... ONLY A
PILE OF ASHES WHERE IT HAD STOOD.

I WEPT LONG, AND TO FORGET MY WEEPING, I SAILED OUT ON THE VAST CALM
SEA. ON THESE WATERS, IN A STAR-SAPPHIRE NIGHT, I PLAYED MY FLUTE TO THE
SUMMER MOON ... MY GRIEF MY MELODY. BUT THE MOON, A WOMAN'S FACE, SOON
VEILED ITSELF WITH CLOUD.

I SAILED BACK TO SHORE, I WALKED AWAY FROM THE WATERS TO THE FRIENDLY
FOREST.... BUT THERE THE TREES TOO TURNED AWAY FROM ME. I KNEW THEN
HAPPINESS WAS BURNED FOREVER UNDER A PILE OF ASHES.

RUNNING BACK TO THE SEA, I DECIDED TO DROWN MYSELF. BUT A WHITE BOAT
SAILED ALONG THE SHORE. A YOUNG GIRL WAS SAILING IT.

O YOU WHO SMILED AT ME THAT DAY WHEN I WAS SUFFERING, O YOU WHO RESCUED
ME FROM GRIEF ... I WILL BUILD AGAIN THE HAPPY HOUSE OF MY CHILDHOOD, IN
YOUR HEART.

GOING TO GATHER LEAVES, LO-FO PUTS UP HER GLEAMING HAIR. SHE PUTS A
PEARL IN EACH PEARL EAR; SHE WEARS A DRESS OF PINK AND A DRESS OF
YELLOW. HER BASKET BEARS A LITTLE TWIST OF SILK.

ON THE SOUTH ROAD THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE CALLS TO HIS MEN TO STOP
THE HORSES. "ASK THAT PRETTY ONE HER NAME. FIND OUT HER AGE FOR ME."

SAID LO-FO: "IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OF TSIN THERE LIVES A GIRL NAMED LO-FO.
SHE IS NOT TWENTY YET, BUT NEITHER IS SHE A CHILD, FOR SHE HAS PASSED
SIXTEEN."

THE GOVERNOR HESITATES. "ASK THE LOVELY MAIDEN IF SHE WISHES TO COME
WITH ME IN MY CHARIOT."

LO-FO LOWERS HER BLACK EYES. "SURELY THE GOVERNOR HAS A WIFE IN THE
SOUTH HE LOVES? SO EVEN IN TSIN, THE MAID LO-FO HAS HER YOUNG MAN WHOM
SHE HAS PROMISED, WHOM SHE LOVES."

THE ASHES LIE CHILL AND GRAY IN THE GOLDEN BRAZIER. MY COVERLETS ROLL IN
RED WAVES AS I TOSS IN MY BED. I THROW THEM OFF AWAY FROM ME; THEY FLOAT
DOWN LIKE WAVES ON THE FLOOR. BUT I HAVE NO STRENGTH TO RISE AND BRUSH
OUT MY LONG HAIR; EVEN THE JADE COMB IS TOO HEAVY FOR MY HAND. LET THE
DUST SETTLE ON MY DRESSING-TABLE, DULLING MY GLEAMING BOTTLES.

NOW THE SUN BEGINS TO GLITTER THROUGH MY CURTAINS. ITS RISING WILL CAST
BITTER SHADOWS OF SORROW IN MY HEART. I WISH TO SPEAK, I WANT TO CRY
OUT; BUT FROM MY THROAT I CRUSH BACK MY CRIES INTO MY HEART. THIS IS NEW
FOR ME, PAIN WHICH COMES NOT FROM TOO MUCH WINE, NOR FROM THE SADNESS OF
APPROACHING AUTUMN.

NO, IT IS OVER NOW AND FINISHED. TODAY HE GOES AWAY. EVEN IF I SANG THE
SWEET STAY-BY-ME SONG TO HIM TEN THOUSAND TIMES, HE WOULD NOT STAY. MY
THOUGHTS MUST TRAVEL THE LONG ROAD TO THE SOUTH COUNTRY: HIS COUNTRY,
VERY FAR AWAY.

SEE THE MIST AROUND MY PAVILION: BEFORE MY EYES THERE IS MIST ALL ABOUT.
IT IS THE IMAGE OF MY SADNESS, THE REFLECTION OF MY DULL, STILL EYES.
FOREVER WILL MY DULL EYES STARE AT YOU, PALE MIST, MY EYES THAT NEVER
WILL LIGHT UP AGAIN.

THAT MAIDEN, DREAMING AT HER WINDOW-LEDGE, LEANING ON HER SOFT WHITE
ARMS ... I DO NOT LOVE HER FOR HER GREAT MANSION ON THE SHORE OF THE
YELLOW RIVER. I LOVE HER BECAUSE SHE HAS LET FALL, FLOATING DOWN INTO
THE STREAM, A LITTLE WILLOW LEAF.

I DO NOT LOVE THE EAST WIND BECAUSE IT CARRIES TO ME THE SCENT OF THOSE
PEACH-TREES THAT ARE LIKE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS. I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT
HAS CARRIED THE LITTLE WILLOW LEAF TO MY BOAT.

AND THE LITTLE WILLOW LEAF ... I DO NOT LOVE IT BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME
THAT SOFT SPRING HAS COME AGAIN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE THE DREAMING MAIDEN
HAS PICKED A NAME ON IT WITH HER NEEDLE, AND BECAUSE THAT NAME IS MINE.

ENTANGLED. RANCID SMELLS DRIVE OUT SWEET FRAGRANCES. EVERYWHERE THE EVIL

                         WEEP NOT, YOUNG WOMEN


IT IS ALWAYS SAD AUTUMN WHEN OUR ENEMIES SWEEP DOWN THEIR RAIDERS FROM
THE MOUNTAINS TO INVADE US.

THE TRUMPETS SUMMON THE WARRIORS! THEY WILL RIDE ON TILL THEY COME TO
THE GREAT WALL. THEN THEY WILL RIDE BEYOND IT, OUT ON THE GREAT KOBI
DESERT.

THERE, ONLY THE COLD BARE MOON. ONLY COLD BEADS OF DEW ON SWORDS AND
SHIELDS. HOW THEY SHIVER.

WEEP NOT, YOUNG WOMEN ... THIS IS NO TIME TO START YOUR WEEPING. WHO
KNOWS HOW LONG THAT YOU MUST WEEP?

MY LITTLE BOAT IS MADE OF EBONY; MY FLUTE-STOPS ARE PURE GOLD. WATER
LOOSENS STAINS FROM SILK ... WINE LOOSENS SADNESS FROM THE HEART.

JEALOUS OF MERE GODS?

THAT NIGHT ... A NIGHT IN EARLY AUTUMN ... WE SAILED TO THE ISLE OF
PARROTS. THERE WE GAZED AT THE ROUND MOON, AND LISTENED TO THE WINDY
PINES.

SUDDENLY WE HEARD MUSIC ... A SAD SONG COMING ON THE WIND. THERE WAS A
SINGER IN A BOAT.

AS IT DREW NEAR US WE SAW A WOMAN, WHITE AS SNOW, SINGING AND CRYING
TOO, LEANING ON THE MAST. MY COMPANIONS ASKED HER WHY SHE WEPT?...
WITHOUT AN ANSWER SHE LOWERED HER HEAD, VEILING HER WHITE FACE IN HER
GOLDEN HAIR.

OF THE SOFT BLUE DRESS YOU WORE ... THAT DAY IN THE PALACE WHEN YOU READ
AND JUDGED THEM.

IF MINE WAS JUDGED THE BEST ... YOU SEE, THERE WAS A VISION OF YOU, A
VISION IN BLUE VEILS, IN THE BLUE DAWN WHEN I COULD NOT SLEEP. SO I GOT
UP FROM BED AND WROTE THE POEM FOR YOU ...

BUT YOU SLEPT ON UNKNOWING IN THAT EARLY DAWN. YOU DID NOT PEEP OUT FROM
THE JADE FLOWER PAVILION TO SEE ROSES BLOOMING IN THE SKY ABOVE THE
PALACE. IN THAT SAME PALACE ONCE, FOR LOVE OF HER, WOU-TI MADE EMPRESS A
LOVELY DANCING-GIRL LIKE YOU.

OUR GAIETY AND WIT? LET US SIT INDOORS.

NOW IS THE TIME FOR POETRY THAT REMEMBERS SUMMER. LET IT BE PUT DOWN
GENTLY ON WHITE PAPER, LIKE FULL-BLOWN PETALS FALLING FROM EXQUISITE
TREES. AND LET MY LIPS DRINK FROM THIS CUP OF SUMMER WINE EACH TIME MY
BRUSH IS DIPPED INTO THE INK. THUS WILL I KEEP MY FANCY FROM FLOATING
OFF LIKE CLOUDS OR SMOKE: TIME PAST ESCAPES FROM US QUICKER THAN A
FLIGHT OF BIRDS.

TOMBS NEAR THE GOLDEN BAZAAR ... SETS OUT INTO THE SWEET SPRING BREEZE.

HIS TALL WHITE CHARGER, SADDLED WITH SILVER, PRANCES GRACEFULLY IN
RHYTHMIC STEPS. BENEATH HIM IS A WHIRLWIND OF PETALS AS HE RIDES THROUGH
THE CARPET OF FALLEN BLOSSOMS.

WHILE THE RIVER-BOAT, LOADED WITH SANDALWOOD, IS WAITING FOR ME TO GO
ABOARD.

WE STAND HAND IN HAND, WE STAND WITHOUT TALKING, WE STAND WITH TEARS ...
TO THINK THAT I MUST TRAVEL A THOUSAND MILES OF MIST AND RAIN AND WATER!
THE EVENING CLOUDS ARE GATHERING AGAIN, AND THE SKY WIDENS TO THE SOUTH.

IT IS AN OLD STORY: PARTING FROM A LOVER IS FULL OF PAIN ... AND IT IS
ALL THE WORSE IN RAINY AUTUMN. TONIGHT, WHEN I GROW SOBER AFTER ALL THIS
WINE, WHERE WILL YOU BE? ON THE WILLOWY SHORE, UNDER THE WANING MOON?

AND I ... ALL THIS YEAR AWAY, SUNSHINE AND LOVELY SIGHTS WILL COME TO ME
IN VAIN ... NO ONE ALL THIS YEAR TO TELL A THOUSAND HAPPY THOUGHTS.

FLOWN TO SOMEONE FAR AWAY.

"A BIRD CAN EASILY FIND ITS MATE AMONG THE LEAVES, BUT ALL A MAIDEN'S

BLACK SILK AT MORNING, FALLEN TO BITTER SNOW BY NIGHT?

NOT REFUSE IT. I OFFER YOU MY SONG: DO NOT IGNORE IT.

I PICK CHRYSANTHEMUMS UNDER THE HEDGE TO THE EAST, GAZE AT THE MOUNTAIN

EVEN IF WE MET NOW, YOU WOULD NEVER RECOGNIZE ME. MY HAIR IS GOING GRAY

RIPPLES ON THE RIVER. EVERYTHING IS DYING, MY YEARS ARE DYING ... I
CANNOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF DEATH.

I STARE AT THE SILKEN LINES OF RAIN, WHERE MY DREAMS ARE FLOATING IN THE
LOST LANDS OF NEVERMORE. ALONE I BLOW ON MY FLUTE OF JADE, UNTIL MY

ENDLESS LEANING ON MY EMPTY BALCONY.

THAT PENNILESS BOY, WHO MENDED HIS CLOTHES WITH PATCHES FROM YOUR OLD
CLOTHES BROUGHT FROM HOME ... AND I TEASED YOU FOR YOUR GOLD HAIRPINS,
SO WE COULD TRADE FOR WINE, AND WE DRANK IT WITH OUR DINNERS OF BERRIES
AND HERBS PICKED CHEAP IN THE FIELD, COOKED OVER DRY LEAVES FROM THE
FIELD ... NOW, WHEN THEY PAY ME WELL, ALL I CAN GIVE BACK TO YOU IS
TEMPLE OFFERINGS.

LONG LONG AGO WE COULD LAUGH AT DYING, BUT DEATH A MAGICIAN CLOSED YOU
IN HIS HAND AND OPENED IT SUDDENLY EMPTY. I HAVE LOCKED YOUR NEEDLEWORK
AWAY, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR CLOTHES AWAY ... MY EYES ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH.
I AM GENTLE, BECAUSE YOU WERE, TO OUR SERVING-MAIDS AND MEN. SOMETIMES
WHEN I DREAM I DREAM I SHOWER YOU WITH GIFTS. ALL OF US MUST KNOW SUCH
SORROW ... TO KNOW IT BEST YOU MUST FIRST BE POOR AND HAPPY TOGETHER.

HERE I SIT ALONE, HERE I SIGH FOR BOTH OF US. HOW MANY BEADS MUST I
STILL COUNT UPON MY STRING OF TIME? BETTER MEN THAN I HAVE GROWN OLD
WITHOUT A SON ... A BETTER POET SANG TO HIS DEAD WIFE WHO COULD NOT
HEAR.

WE NEVER SAID THAT WE WOULD MEET AGAIN IN DEATH. I HAVE NO HOPE BEYOND
THE DARKNESS. ALL I HAVE, IS TO STARE INTO THE NIGHT, SEEING AGAIN AND
AGAIN THAT LITTLE WORRIED WRINKLE IN YOUR BROW.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
