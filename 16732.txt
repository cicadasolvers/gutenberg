PREFACE.

The object of this work is to show, to some extent, the obligations our
language owes to various authors for numerous phrases and familiar
quotations which have become "household words."

This Collection, originally made without any view of publication, has
been considerably enlarged by additions from an English work on a
similar plan, and is now sent forth with the hope that it may be found a
convenient book of reference.

Though perhaps imperfect in some respects, it is believed to possess the
merit of accuracy, as the quotations have been taken from the original
sources.

Should this be favorably received, endeavors will be made to make it
more worthy of the approbation of the public in a future edition.

SHAKESPEARE.


TEMPEST.


Act i. Sc. 2.

And do my spiriting gently.

A very ancient and fishlike smell.


Act ii. Sc. 2.

Misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows.


Act iv. Sc. 1.

Our revels row are ended: these our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits, and
Are melted into air, into thin air:
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
And, like an insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind.


Act iv. Sc. 1.

We are such stuff
As dreams are made of, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.

TWELFTH NIGHT.


Act i. Sc. 1.

If music be the food of love, play on,
Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken, and so die.--
That strain again--it had a dying fall;
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south,
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Stealing and giving odor.


Act i. Sc, 3.

I am sure care's an enemy to life.


Act i. Sc. 5.

'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on.


Act ii. Sc. 3.

Dost thou think, because them art virtuous,
there shall be no more cakes and ale?


Act ii. Sc. 4.

She never told her love,
But let concealment, like a worm in the bud,
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
And, with a green and yellow melancholy,
She sat, like Patience on a monument,
Smiling at grief.


Act iii. Sc. 1.

In the contempt and anger of his lip!

And make us lose the good we oft might win,
By fearing to attempt.


Act ii. Sc. 2.

O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.


Act ii. Sc. 2.

But man, proud man!
Drest in a little brief authority,

       *       *       *       *       *

Plays such fantastic tricks before high Heaven
As make the angels weep.


Act iii. Sc. 1.

The miserable have no other medicine,
But only hope.


Act iii. Sc. 1.

The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.


Act iii. Sc. 1.

Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot.


Act iv. Sc. 1.

Take, O take those lips away,
That so sweetly were forsworn;
And those eyes, the break of day,
Lights that do mislead the morn;
But my kisses bring again,
Seals of love, but sealed in vain.[1]

[Note 1: This song; is found in "The Bloody Brother, or Rollo, Duke
of Normandy," by Beaumont and Fletcher, Act 5, Sc. 2, with the following
additional stanza:

    "Hide, O hide those hills of snow,
    Which thy frozen bosom bears,
    On whose tops the fruits that grow
    Are of those that April wears;
    But first set my poor heart free.
    Bound in those icy chains for thee."

There has been much controversy about the authorship, but the more
probable opinion seems to be that the second stanza was added by
Fletcher.]

He hath indeed better bettered expectation.

Save in the office and affairs of love.
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
Let every eye negotiate for itself,
And trust no other agent.

Silence is the perfectest herald of joy; I were but little happy, if I
could say how much.

For there was never yet philosopher
That could endure the toothache patiently.


MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.


Act i. Sc. 1.

But earthly happier is the rose distilled
Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.


Act i. Sc. 1.

Ah me! for aught that ever I could read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth.

And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

In forty minutes.

Where ox-lips and the nodding violet grows.


Act iii. Sc. 2.

So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted.


Act v. Sc. 1.

The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.


LOVE'S LABOR'S LOST.


Act ii. Sc. 1.

A merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal.

argument.


MERCHANT OF VENICE.


Act i. Sc. 1.

I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage, where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.


Act i. Sc. 1.

Why should a man, whose blood is warm
within,
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?


Act i. Sc. 1.

I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark!


Act i, Sc. 1.

Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing; more than any man in all
Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of
chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them: and, when you have
them, they are not worth the search.


Act i. Sc. 3.

Even there, where merchants most do congregate.


Act i. Sc. 3.

Act iii. Sc. 1.

I am a Jew: hath not a Jew eyes? hath not
a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,
affections, passions?


Act iii. Sc. 5.

Thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall
into Charybdis, your mother.


Act iv. Sc. 1.

What! wouldst thou have a serpent sting
thee twice?


Act iv. Sc. 1.

The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blessed;
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes,


Act iv. Sc. 1.

A Daniel come to judgment.


Act iv. Sc. 1.

Is it so nominated in the bond.

       *       *       *       *       *

I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond?


Act iv. Sc. 1.

I have thee on the hip

Act iv. Sc. 1.

I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word


Act v. Sc. 1.

How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!


Act v. Sc. 1.

I am never merry when I hear sweet music.


Act v. Sc. 1.

The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.


Act v. Sc. 1.

How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.


       *       *       *       *       *


AS YOU LIKE IT.


Act i. Sc. 2.

Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.


Act i. Sc. 2.

My pride fell with my fortunes.


Act i. Sc. 3.

_Cel_. Not a word?
_Ros_. Not one to throw at a dog.


Act i. Sc. 3.

O how full of briers is this working-day world!


Act ii. Sc. 1.

Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.


Act ii. Sc. 1.

And this our life, exempt from public haunts,
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.


Act ii. Sc. 1.

"Poor deer," quoth he, "thou mak'st a testament,
As wordlings do, giving thy sum of more
To that which had too much."


Act ii. Sc. 3.

And He that doth the ravens feed,
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Be comfort to my age!


Act ii. Sc. 3.

For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood;

       *       *       *       *       *

Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty, but kindly.


Act ii. Sc. 7.

And railed on lady Fortune in good terms,
In good set terms....
And looking on it with lack-luster eye,
"Thus we may see," quoth he, "how the
world wags.

       *       *       *       *       *

And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,
And thereby hangs a tale."

       *       *       *       *       *

Motley's the only wear.


Act ii. Sc. 7.

If ladies be but young and fair,
They have the gift to know it.


Act ii. Sc. 7.

I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
To blow on whom I please.


Act ii. Sc. 7.

The why is plain as way to parish church.


Act ii. Sc. 7.

All the world's a stage
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts

       *       *       *       *       *

And then, the whining schoolboy, with his satchel,
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then, the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then, a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth And then the justice,

       *       *       *       *       *

Full of wise saws and modern instances,
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon.

       *       *       *       *       *

Last scene of all,
That ends this strange, eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivion.


Act ii. Sc. 7.

Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
Thou art not so unkind
As man's ingratitude.


Act iii. Sc. 2.

Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?


Act iii. Sc. 8.

Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.


Act iv. Sc. 1.

I had rather have a fool to make me merry, than experience to make me
sad.


Act iv. Sc. 1.

Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for
love.


Act iv. Sc. 3.

Pacing through the forest,
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy.


Act v. Sc. 2.

How bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's
eyes!


Act v. Sc. 4.

Your _If_ is the only peacemaker; much
virtue in _If_.

A merry heart goes all the day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.


Act iv. Sc. 3.

Daffodils,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty; violets, dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes,
Or Cytherea's breath.


Act iv. Sc. 3.

When you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that.

ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.


Act i. Sc. 1.

It were all one,
That I should love a bright, particular star,
And think to wed it, he is so above me.

Praising what is lost
Makes the remembrance dear.

Act i. Sc. 4.

There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face.


Act i. Sc. 5.

Yet I do fear thy nature;
It is too full of the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way.


Act i. Sc. 5.

Your face, my thane, is as a book, where men
May read strange matters.


Act i. Sc. 7.

If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly.

That but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here.


Act i. Sc. 7.

This even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice
To our own lips.

Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking off.


Act i. Sc, 7.

I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself,
And falls on the other--.

Golden opinions from all sorts of people.

Thou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear

Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding.

Act iv. Sc. 3.

O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,
And braggart with my tongue!


Act v. Sc. 3.

My way of life
Is fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf;
And that which should accompany old age,
As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
Curses, not loud, but deep, mouth-honor, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, but dare not.


Act v. Sc. 3.

Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
That keep her from her rest.


Act v. Sc. 3.

Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased;
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow;
Raze out the written troubles of the brain;
And, with some sweet oblivious antidote,
Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?


Act v. Sc, 3.

Throw physic to the dogs: I'll none of it.


Act v. Sc. 3.

Act v, Sc. 5.

Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The cry is still, _They come_.


Act v. Sc. 5.

To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more; it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.


Act v. Sc. 5.

Blow, wind! come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back.


Act. v. Sc. 7.

Thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward,
Thou little valiant, great in villany!
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou fortune's champion, that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety!

Act iii. Sc. 4.

Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale,
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man.


Act iv. Sc. 2.

To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet,
To smooth the ice, or add another hue
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.


Act iv. Sc. 2.

Now oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Makes deeds ill done!

Act i. Sc. 2.

He will give the devil his due.


Act i. Sc. 3.

And, as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly, unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.


Act i. Sc. 3.

By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon.

SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV.


Act i. Sc. 1.

Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless.
So dull, so dead in look, so woebegone,
Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
And would have told him, half his Troy was burned.


Act i. Sc. 1.

Never to hope again.

Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point?--Upon the word,

Act i. Sc. 2.

Ye gods, it doth amaze me,

Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about

Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights;

No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,

Act i. Sc. 2.

Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.


Act i. Sc. 2.

Act i. Sc. 2.

He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.


Act i. Sc. 2.

A countenance more
In sorrow than in anger.


Act i. Sc. 3.

Act i. Sc. 3.

Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried
Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel.

       *       *       *       *       *

Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.

Act i. Sc. 3.

Act i. Sc. 4.

But to my mind--though I am native here,
And to the manner born--it is a custom
More honored in the breach than the observance.

Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!

Act i. Sc. 4.

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.


Act i. Sc. 5.

I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like quills upon the fretful Porcupine.


Act i. Sc. 5.

O my prophetic soul! my uncle!


Act i. Sc. 5.

No reckoning made, but sent to my account

Act iii. Sc. 1.

To be, or not to be? that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind, to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And, by opposing, end them?--To die--to sleep--
No more--and, by a sleep, to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to--'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die--to sleep--
To sleep! perchance, to dream--ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause.

       *       *       *       *       *

The spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes;
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin. Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death--
The undiscovered country, from whose bourne
No traveler returns--puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought.

       *       *       *       *       *

Act iii. Sc. 2.

I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made
them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.


Act iii. Sc. 2.

No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee,
Where thrift may follow fawning.


Act iii. Sc. 2.

Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of hearts,
As I do thee.

Something too much of this.

Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;
For some must watch, while some must sleep;
Thus runs the world away.

Look here, upon this picture, and on this;
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on this brow!
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command.
A combination, and a form, indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.


Act iii. Sc. 4.

A king Of shreds and patches.

Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach.

My story being done
She gave me for my pains a world of signs:
She swore, In faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing; strange;
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
She wished she had not heard it; yet she

That Heaven had made her such a man.

Good name, in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my purse, steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs roe of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.

O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth make

As proofs of holy writ.

Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,

_On a Wedding_.

Her feet beneath her petticoat,
Like little mice, stole in and out,
As if they feared the light;
But oh! she dances such a way!
No sun upon an Easter-day
Is half so fine a sight.

       *       *       *       *       *

Her lips were red, and one was thin,
Compared with that was next her chin,
Some bee had stung it newly.

Why so pale and wan, fond lover,
Prithee, why so pale?
Will, when looking well can't move her,
Looking ill prevail?
Prithee, why so pale?

_The Rock of Rubies, and the Quarrie of Pearls_.

Some asked me where the Rubies grew,
And nothing I did say;
But with my finger pointed to
The lips of Julia.
Some asked how Pearls did grow, and where?
Then spoke I to my Girl,
To part her lips, and showed them there
The quarelets of Pearl.

A little out, and then,
As if they played at Bo-peep,
Did soon draw in again.

What in me is dark,
Illumine; what is low, raise and support;
That to the height of this great argument
I may assert eternal Providence,
And justify the ways of God to men.

Yet from those flames
No light; but only darkness visible.

Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.

To reign is worth ambition, though in hell:
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.

But all was false and hollow, though his tongue
Dropped manna; and could make the worse appear
The better reason, to perplex and dash
Maturest counsels.

With grave
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed
A pillar of state; deep on his front engraven

_Prologue to Thomson's Coriolanus_.

For his chaste Muse employed her heaven-taught lyre
None but the noblest passions to inspire,
Not one immoral, one corrupted thought,
One line, which dying he could wish to blot.


_Epigram_.

None without hope e'er loved the brightest fair,
But love can hope where reason would despair.

That never feels a pain.

Can't I another's face commend,
And to her virtues be a friend,
But instantly your forehead lowers,
As if _her_ merit lessened _yours_?


_Fable X. The Spider and the Bee_.

The maid who modestly conceals
Her beauties, while she hides, reveals;
Give but a glimpse, and fancy draws
Whate'er the Grecian Venus was.

Time still, as he flies, adds increase to her truth,
And gives to her mind what he steals from her youth.

His warmest welcome at an inn.

A stranger yet to pain!

       *       *       *       *       *

Hands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,

By all their country's wishes blessed!

       *       *       *       *       *

By fairy hands their knell is rung;
By forms unseen their dirge is sung;

To bless the turf that wraps their clay;
And Freedom shall awhile repair,
To dwell a weeping hermit there.

_The Fireside_. St. 3.

If solid happiness we prize,
Within our breast this jewel lies;
And they are fools who roam:
The world has nothing to bestow;
From our own selves our joys must flow,
And that dear hut--our home.

Thus hand in hand through life we'll go;
Its checkered paths of joy and woe
With cautious steps we'll tread.

So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind's roar.
But bind him to his native mountains more.

Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,
I see the lords of human kind pass by.

Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey,
Where wealth accumulates, and men decay,
Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade,
A breath can make them, as a breath has made;
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
When once destroyed, can never be supplied.


Line 62.

Line 100.

A youth of labor with an age of ease.

While resignation gently slopes the way--
And, all his prospects brightening to the last,
His heaven commences ere the world be past!

A man he was to all the country dear,

For even though vanquished, he could argue still;
While words of learned length and thundering sound
Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew
That one small head could carry all he knew.


Line 229.

Contrived a double debt to pay.


Line 254.

One native charm than all the gloss of art.


Line 264.

The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy.

Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,
Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn.

When lovely woman stoops to folly,
And finds too late that men betray,
What charm can soothe her melancholy?
What art can wash her guilt away?
The only art her guilt to cover,
To hide her shame from every eye,
To give repentance to her lover,
And wring his bosom, is--to die.

One foot on sea, and one on shore,
To one thing constant never.

Book iv.

I have seen
A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract
Of inland ground, applying to his ear
The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell;
To which, in silence hushed, his very soul
Listened intensely; and his countenance soon
Brightened with joy; for from within were heard
Murmurings, whereby the monitor expressed
Mysterious union with its native sea.

Had ripened into faith, and faith become

Canto iii. St. 2.

Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,

For love is heaven, and heaven is love.


Canto v. St. 1.

Call it not vain; they do not err,
Who say, that, when the poet dies,
Mute Nature mourns her worshiper,
And celebrates his obsequies.


Canto v. St. 13.

True love's the gift which God has given
To man alone beneath the heaven.
It is the secret sympathy,
The silver link, the silken tie,
Which heart to heart, and mind to mind,
In body and in soul can bind.


Canto vi. St. 1.

Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned,
As home his footsteps he hath turned
Prom wandering on a foreign strand?

And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned
On lips that are for others; deep as love,
Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
O Death in Life, the days that are no more.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
