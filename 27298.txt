MODEL "S" CARBURETER

Used on Series 691 Nash Sixes


The carbureter measures the fuel charges for the engine and
automatically mixes them with the proper amount of air to form a highly
combustible gas. The Marvel Model "S" Carbureter is of the automatic air
valve, heat controlled type. Its outstanding advantages are:

1. Simplicity of construction and operation.

2. Quick starting in any weather.

3. Automatically controlled heat application to ensure complete
vaporization of fuels.

4. Economy in fuel consumption.

5. Ease of adjustment to meet varied driving and climatic conditions.


CONSTRUCTION

The construction embodies a main body or mixing chamber and a
conventional float chamber bowl with fuel strainer attached at point of
entrance of fuel to bowl. Within the mixing chamber are two nozzles
which proportion the amount of gasoline used in the mixture. One of
these nozzles, called the "low speed," is regulated by the gasoline
adjustment screw at bottom of carbureter and the other, called the "high
speed," is controlled by the automatic air valve. An air screw is
provided which regulates the pressure of the air valve spring enclosed
therein. Within this screw is also enclosed a plunger connected by a
link to the air valve. The function of this plunger is to provide a
resistance in addition to that of the air valve spring to assist in
acceleration. This arrangement of plunger and air valve screw is termed
the dash pot.

A further control of the high speed jet is provided by the fuel metering
valve operated by the carbureter throttle. This valve provides the
maximum fuel feed to the "high speed" nozzle when the throttle is fully
opened for high speeds and for quick "pick up." During the ordinary
driving ranges this valve controls the amount of fuel being used, thus
providing all the economy possible. This valve is entirely automatic and
requires no adjustment.

The passage-way from the mixing chamber to the intake manifold is
controlled by a butterfly valve which is called the throttle-valve and
is connected to the throttle-lever on the steering wheel as well as to
the foot accelerator, its position determining the amount of gas and air
or mixture being fed the engine.


STARTING

A choke button is provided on the instrument board to assist in
starting. Pulling out this button closes a butterfly choker valve (see
cut) in the air intake passage of carbureter which restricts the air
opening of the carbureter, and consequently produces a richer mixture.

To start engine, pull out choke button all the way. Advance spark lever
about half way and throttle lever about one-quarter way and depress
starter pedal.

As soon as motor fires when starting, this control should be released
part way, otherwise too much fuel will be drawn from carbureter, causing
flooding of the motor and failure of the latter to continue to promptly
fire. After starting, motor should be allowed to run "part choke" as
stated for a few minutes while warming up, then the choker control
should be fully released, or pushed in completely on the instrument
board, and engine allowed to run normally for sometime until water in
cylinder jackets is thoroughly warmed up before starting to make final
carbureter adjustments.


HEAT CONTROL--STOVE

In the colder seasons warm air is fed to air intake of carbureter
through the warm air elbow "F" (see cut). This elbow connects the
carbureter with the warm air stove, which is a casting surrounding the
two exhaust heat tubes which supply exhaust heat to the carbureter
jackets as described below.

The amount of heat required for proper carburation depends on the
temperature of the outside air. The first means of control is in the
warm air stove just described, which should be connected to the
carbureter furnishing warm air to carbureter air intake in all seasons
of the year when the outside air temperature is below 50 deg. F., whenever
the outside air temperature runs above this point cold air should be
furnished to carbureter air intake. This can be done by loosening the
wing nut holding the warm air elbow "F" on the stove and also loosening
the set screw holding this elbow in the air intake of carbureter, after
which slide elbow out of air intake and revolve it--180 degrees about an
horizontal axis and re-insert in carbureter air intake and lock in place
with set screw. The opening in the elbow now is turned down away from
the stove and draws in only cold air.

The above procedure, it must be understood, will vary somewhat due to
differences in locality, altitude and fuels used, but it should be borne
in mind that the best economy can be had with cold air passing to the
carbureter, and the stove should not be connected until the acceleration
and performance of the job requires the use of warm air for the best
results.

The adjustment of the carbureter should be made per the above
description of the stove, as the latter is used for meeting weather
conditions and should be set as described.


HEAT CONTROL--CARBURETER JACKETS

The carbureter and manifolds have been designed to utilize the exhaust
gases of the engine to insure complete vaporization and a consequent
minimum consumption of fuel. This is accomplished by surrounding the
upper portion of the mixing chamber with a large heat jacket provided
with an inlet and an outlet opening and connected by means of tubes to
an exhaust manifold valve body in the exhaust pipe of the engine; this
valve body, housing a large valve called the main-exhaust-heat-valve
("C" in cut) within the body itself, the return or outlet tube from the
carbureter heat jacket entering the valve-body in the lower portion
below the main-exhaust-heat-valve.

The main-exhaust-heat-valve "C" is connected by means of a lever and
long connecting rod to the throttle lever of the carbureter so that when
the throttle valve is operated the main-exhaust-valve is operated
simultaneously with it.

The purpose of the carbureter heat jacket and valve in exhaust line with
connections described, is to provide means for utilizing the heat of the
exhaust gases of the motor for vaporization of the fuel supplied the
engine by the carbureter and to do so automatically. The automatic
feature of same is accomplished by setting the Main-Exhaust-Heat-Valve
"C" by means of the long connecting rod, in closed position with the
closed or idling position of the throttle valve, thus providing for and
causing all of the exhaust gases of the engine to pass through the heat
jacket of the carbureter when engine is idling and to regulate the
volume of this heat as throttle is opened by automatically opening the
Main-Exhaust-Heat-Valve, thus allowing the increasing volume of the
exhaust gases to pass on out through the main exhaust pipe without being
deflected and by-passed to the carbureter heat-jacket as the motor speed
increases.

[Illustration: HEAT SETTING No. 1]

By referring to the cut shown (See Page 5) and noting "Heat Setting No.
1," it will be noted that valve "C" in main exhaust line is fully closed
with the closed or idling position of the throttle valve. This
adjustment is accomplished by having long connecting rod "R" from valve
"C" Lever set in "Hole No. 1," in Throttle Lever "L," being sure that
when throttle valve is standing in fully closed or idling position that
valve "C" is also in closed position, proving out the latter feature by
loosening connection of valve "C" lever holding long connecting rod;
holding Throttle Lever "L" in closed or idling position and bringing up
valve "C" lever on connecting rod "R" as far as it will go to the right
toward the carbureter and tightening its connection on the connecting
rod in that position. After having made the adjustment as just
described, it is assured that "Heat Setting No. 1" has been properly
made and that all of the heat possible from the exhaust has been
secured.

This "Heat Setting No. 1," provides as stated, for the most exhaust heat
obtainable and should be used during the entire year, except in
extremely hot seasons or hot climates or when high-test gasoline is
being used in engine and even then unless engine is losing power due to
excessive heat.

If loss of power or mileage due to too much heat is experienced, first
be sure that it is not due to driving on hot-air instead of cold-air.
After making this observation, if there is still too much heat, refer to
cut (See Page 7) describing "Heat Setting No. 2." It will be noted that
connecting rod "R" from valve "C" is removed from "Hole No. 1," in
Throttle Lever "L" and placed in "Hole No. 2," in Throttle Lever. This
change is all that is necessary in order to reduce the amount of heat
applied to carbureter. In "Heat Setting No. 2," when the throttle is in
closed or idling position, valve "C" is quite aways off its seat. This
adjustment provides for a great deal less heat than is provided by "Heat
Setting No. 1" and is all that is required in the reduction of the
volume of heat together with driving on "Cold" air for the
main-air-supply, in the warmest weather or hottest climates.

[Illustration: HEAT SETTING No. 2]


NOTE--After original position of valve "C" is made as described in "Heat
Setting No. 1" do not again readjust valve "C" on connecting rod but
when changing from "Heat Setting No. 1" to "Heat Setting No. 2," merely
change position of long connecting rod from "Hole No. 1" to "Hole No. 2"
in throttle lever.


ADJUSTMENT

No change should be made in the carbureter adjustments until after an
inspection has been made to determine if the trouble is in some other
unit. It should be noted that the gasoline lines are clear, that there
is gasoline in the vacuum tank, that there are no leaks at connections
between carbureter and engine, that the ignition system is in proper
condition, and that there is even compression in all cylinders.

If it is necessary to test adjustment or to make a readjustment proceed
as follows:

Set air screw so that the end is flush with the end of ratchet set
spring. Loosen packing nut on needle adjustment. Turn gasoline
adjustment to the right very carefully so as not to injure the needle
point, until the valve is closed gently against its seat. Then turn to
left approximately one complete turn which will bring notch in the disc
handle directly below the guide post above it. Tighten packing nut to
hold needle firmly as set.

The notch in disc handle of needle is put in handle after the needle has
been carefully calibrated by a flow-meter at the factory, therefore the
notch in handle should register with guide post above it. This setting
of needle valve is absolutely essential to get the best results. The
object in directing that needle be first turned to the right until
closed is to insure against two or more turns open, as from closed
position to notch (usually about one turn) is the normal setting. This
being true it is not necessary to turn needle in to the right firmly but
merely far enough to be sure that when turning back to the left, to the
notch registering with guide post, that the needle is not more than once
around or one turn from its seat.

Set stove heat and damper heat as previously instructed above. Pull out
choker to closed position and start engine in usual manner. As soon as
engine has fired release choker three-fourths of way in. Run until
engine has warmed up then push choker all the way in, remembering to
never use choker longer than necessary, as when not needed it has a
tendency to foul up engine and ruin the lubricating oil in the crank
case.

Next, set air screw for good idle by either turning to the right a
little or backing out to the left as the needs of the engine require,
remembering that first of all, the needle must be set as described. With
the needle so set and the engine warmed up, the adjustment of the air
screw for proper idling is easily accomplished by using a little care.
If the air screw is turned in too tight, the motor will roll. If the air
screw is not tight enough, the motor will hesitate and perhaps stop
entirely. To make a nice clean adjustment for idle, first having set
needle as described, turn air screw in quarter of a turn at a time until
engine, does roll; then turn back to the left until engine hesitates,
indicating that mixture has too much air and is too lean; next turn air
screw in to the right three or four notches at a time until engine runs
smoothly. This accomplished (and it is very easy to do by proceeding as
directed above) the proper adjustment for the entire range of the engine
will have been attained, thus insuring the best economy and power.

If the engine idles too fast with throttle closed, the latter may be
adjusted by means of the throttle lever adjusting screw.


RICH MIXTURE

An over-rich mixture will cause the engine speed to fluctuate through
more or less regular periods from high to low speeds; the engine will
seem to be mis-firing and there will be noticeable a strong odor, as
well as, usually, a heavy black smoke from the exhaust.


LEAN MIXTURE

The best adjustment is obtained with the fuel and air valves set as
described. It must be remembered that too lean a mixture as well as an
over rich mixture causes over-heating and loss of power and is not as
economical as an adjustment which provides just the proper proportion of
gasoline and air.


CAUTION

It must be remembered that the low speed needle has been carefully
calibrated to notch in disc handle and guide post above it, at the
factory and that in making an adjustment that the needle must be so set
and the rest of the adjusting done with the air screw as described,
never varying from described needle setting unless in extreme cold
weather, when a little more gas may be carried, or turning off a little
when casing head gas is used in hot weather.

REPLACEMENT FOR PREVIOUS MODEL NASH SIXES

The Model "S" Marvel Carbureter is interchangeable with the Model "K"
Marvel Carbureter, which was standard equipment on the 1922 and 1923
Nash Sixes of the early 691 series.

The previous series 681 Nash Sixes of 1921, 1920, and 1919, which were
equipped with the Model "E" Marvel Carbureter as standard equipment, can
be very greatly improved by the installation of the Model "S"
carbureter, exhaust damper body assembly necessary for same, and the hot
air stove assembly that goes with this installation.

Following is the complete Parts Price List of the Model "S" carbureter,
damper body assembly and stove parts for same. Notice is called to the
fact again that the damper body and stove parts are not needed on the
early 691 series of 1922 and 1923.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
