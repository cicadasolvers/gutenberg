                    INTRODUCTION TO THE NEW EDITION


History, with all of its ramifications, is a complex subject. Often,
students pursue it with only the written word in hand, in an attempt to
gain a deeper, and more meaningful understanding of it. This is usually
the case because other means of historical relation are not available,
or completely nonexistent. The strict narration of facts is not a
sufficient means alone for broadening one's knowledge of the past.

Whenever the written word can be complemented with other media, for
example, worthwhile actual photographs, a more complete understanding of
the past is experienced. Literally, a picture is worth a thousand words,
and the student can gain, for himself, a more penetrating insight into
his subject which words alone cannot always provide him.

In publishing _Michigan's Copper Country In Early Photos_, a pictorial
account of the Copper Country around 1900, the Black Letter Press has
made a more complete understanding of the region possible by
supplementing its written histories with the varied collection of
photographs. The area's setting, its people, and their work are
portrayed. Originally, the book was published as, _Souvenir of the
Copper Country Upper Peninsula of Michigan_. Copies of this original
work are extremely scarce today.

In his introduction to the original publication, B.E. Tyler, the
publisher, states that the Copper Country is a place of natural beauty,
with the mining of copper from the bowels of the earth as the district's
major industry. This was written in 1903, and the pictures presented in
the volume's pages offer supportive evidence to his words. However, time
has moved on, and much has both changed and remained the same in the
Copper Country.

Tyler mentions a picture of the Cliff Mining Camp, and relates that the
work has been abandoned, but, "almost every house that was ever erected
there is standing." This is no longer true. All structures have been
dismantled, and all that remains of the once proud and fabulous Cliff
mine are a few poor rock piles.

The many gabled, and uniquely constructed Quincy Rock House was to be
found in Hancock, and it was reputed to be the most photographed mine
structure of its kind in the country. It was destroyed by fire in 1956.

The Douglas House, a famous meeting place, and hotel, in Houghton still
remains, although its appearance has been altered, and its surroundings
have changed.

The Kerredge Theater, in Hancock, was completed in 1902, with some seats
costing as much as forty dollars for a single performance. Popular
shows, Shakespearian plays, and operas, were presented on its stage.

Copper mining no longer remains the major industry of the area. Once
where many shafts were sunk deep into the earth, and their rockhouses
lined the horizon, only a few remain today as reminders of a bygone era,
standing as ever vigilant sentinels, guarding what may be left of their
once rich copper deposits. Gone are the giant hoisting machines used to
bring copper ore to the surface. Gone are the miners, who labored hard
by candlelight with simple hand tools, replaced by today's modern miner
using his battery operated head lamp, and power machinery when work is
available. Only exploratory and experimental work is presently being
conducted in the Copper Country.

One aspect of the Copper Country which remains relatively unchanged is
its rugged natural beauty. The sparkling clear deep blue waters of
chilling Lake Superior still crash upon its rocky tree lined shores. A
green mantle of dense forests covers much of the land, which in places
is wild and mountainous. Water still rushes over spectacular falls as it
flows onward toward the world's largest fresh water lake. Past and
present residents, and many visitors, have witnessed the scenic
panorama, with some insisting that the climate of the Copper Country has
an exhilarating, and refreshing therapeutic affect upon them.

Suggested reading material on the Copper Country might include the
following titles that are considered to be of more than passing
interest: _Red Metal_, by C. Harry Benedict, _Prehistoric Copper Mining
in the Lake Superior Region_, edited by Roy W. Drier, and Octave J.
DuTemple, _Boom Copper_, by Angus Murdock, and _The Cliff_, by Donald
Chaput. Also of worthwhile reading are such historical novels on the
region as, _Where Copper Is King_, by James Wright, published in 1905,
and, _The Long Winter Ends_, by Newton G. Thomas.

Another beneficial book is, _A True Description of the Lake Superior
Country_, written by John St. John, and originally published in 1846. It
was republished by the Black Letter Press in 1976, and it provides its
readers with a rare and invaluable first hand account of early Copper
Country settings. Of particular interest are the author's descriptions
of the region's geologic development, and of the early copper mines.

_Michigan's Copper Country In Early Photos_ adds a new dimension to the
historiography of the Copper Country, providing in pictures what the
student may not grasp from the written word.

  Richard A. Cebelak
  Grand Rapids, Michigan
  March, 1977

The simple beauty of the Copper Country of Michigan, the vastness of its
enterprises and the activity of its marts are impressive in their very
nature. Their pictures are more pleasing when left unmarred by wordy
descriptions. Scenes may be absorbed and grasped by the eye which no
language can describe.

This book is a simple collection of pictures, characteristic of scenes
which are familiar to those acquainted with the Copper Country. The
effort has been put forth to make it as comprehensive as possible.

The winning of the copper from the earth constitutes the dominant
industry of the district, and is deserving of first place in a
representation of the Copper Country. All features of the industry are
shown--in the depths of the mine; on the surface, where the world's most
massive machinery furnishes power to actuate the air drills and operate
the hoisting cables; in the mills and smelters, where the metal is
refined into copper bullion; along the wharves, where ships are laden
with the product, to carry it to lower lake ports, whence it is
distributed throughout the world.

Historic points of interest are given. There is a picture of the old
Cliff Mining Camp, one of the earliest, and, in its day, one of the most
populous and prosperous communities in the Upper Peninsula. To-day
almost every house that was ever erected there is standing, most of them
dating back nearly half a century, but the place is deserted--hundreds
of houses with bare walls staring out through bleak windows, and
scarcely a dozen souls to inhabit them. The old mine workings are
abandoned for more profitable deposits of mineral.

Pictures are given which show the natural beauty of the Copper Country.
Pleasing views are so bountifully bestowed by nature that it is a
difficult task to choose the most impressive. But enough are given to
create a taste for more--a taste that can be gratified to its fullest
only by rambling among the vales and hills, through the forests and
along the banks of the quiet streams and the shores of the mighty
Unsalted Sea.

The new South Range is thoroughly pictured. This is the young giant
which in the last five years has forged forward and wrought from the
ground which was the rooting place for an unbroken forest a group of
copper mining camps that stand to-day close rivals to the older camps
which have been half a century in the making.

Such pictures constitute within themselves a story of beauty, power and
pathos which no words can enhance. Those responsible for the book have
drawn from its preparation a wealth of pleasure. Courtesies have been
extended from all sources, in recompense for which the sincerest
expression of appreciation is now extended. May those into whose hands
the book shall come glean from it all the subtle meaning and all the
stirring thoughts which its pictures are capable of inspiring. It will
then be an epic, indeed--a poem, a song, a burst of harmony beyond the
power of words to utter.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
