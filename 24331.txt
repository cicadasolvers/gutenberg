INSCRIBED

To GEORGE C. HITT

The beginning of whose steadfast friendship was marked by the first
publication of these verses which now, expanded by writer, honored by
publisher and masterfully graced by artist, seem to be a worthier symbol
of the author's grateful and affectionate regard for his earliest
friend

I      Frontispiece--An Old Sweetheart of Mine.

II     A fair, illusive vision that would vanish into air

III    The _then_ of changeless sunny days--The _now_ of shower and shine

IV     The old bookshelves and prints along the wall

V      I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine

VI     Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke

VII    When my truant fancies wander with that old sweetheart of mine

VIII   The voices of my children and the mother as she sings

IX     For I find an extra flavor in Memory's mellow wine

X      O childhood days enchanted! O the magic of the spring

XI     To--smile, behind my lesson, at that old sweetheart of mine

XII    A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace

XIII   When first I kissed her, and she answered the caress

XIV    I slipped the apple in it--and the teacher didn't know

XV     She gave me her _photograph_, and printed "Ever Thine"

XVI    And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand

XVII   Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine

XVIII  And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray

XIX    The door is softly opened, and--my wife is standing there


    _The ordered intermingling_
      _of the real and the dream,--_
    _The mill above the river,_
      _and the mist above the stream;_
    _The life of ceaseless labor,_
      _brave with song and cheery call--_
    _The radiant skies of evening,_
      _with its rainbow o'er us all._


    AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE!--Is this
      her presence here with me,
    Or but a vain creation of
      a lover's memory?

    A fair, illusive vision
      that would vanish into air
    Dared I even touch the silence
      with the whisper of a prayer?

[Illustration]

    Nay, let me then believe in all
      the blended false and true--
    The semblance of the _old_ love
      and the substance of the _new_,--

    The _then_ of changeless sunny days--
      the _now_ of shower and shine--
    But Love forever smiling,--
      as that old sweetheart of mine.

[Illustration]

    This ever-restful sense of _home_,
      though shouts ring in the hall.--
    The easy-chair--the old bookshelves
      and prints along the wall;

    The rare _Habanas_ in their box,
      or gaunt churchwarden-stem
    That often wags, above the jar,
      derisively at them.

[Illustration]

    As one who cons at evening
      o'er an album, all alone,
    And muses on the faces
      of the friends that he has known,

    So I turn the leaves of Fancy,
      till, in shadowy design,
    I find the smiling features of
      an old sweetheart of mine.

[Illustration]

    The lamplight seems to glimmer
      with a flicker of surprise,
    As I turn it low--to rest me
      of the dazzle in my eyes,

    And light my pipe in silence,
      save a sigh that seems to yoke
    Its fate with my tobacco
      and to vanish with the smoke.

[Illustration]

    'Tis a _fragrant_ retrospection,--
      for the loving thoughts that start
    Into being are like perfume
      from the blossom of the heart;

    And to dream the old dreams over
      is a luxury divine--
    When my truant fancies wander
      with that old sweetheart of mine.

[Illustration]

    Though I hear beneath my study,
      like a fluttering of wings,
    The voices of my children
      and the mother as she sings--

    I feel no twinge of conscience
      to deny me any theme
    When Care has cast her anchor
      In the harbor of a dream--

[Illustration]

    In fact, to speak in earnest,
      I believe it adds a charm
    To spice the good a trifle
      with a little dust of harm,--

    For I find an extra flavor
      in Memory's mellow wine
    That makes me drink the deeper
      to that old sweetheart of mine.

[Illustration]

    O Childhood-days enchanted!
      O the magic of the Spring!--
    With all green boughs to blossom white,
      and all bluebirds to sing!

    When all the air, to toss and quaff,
      made life a jubilee
    And changed the children's song and
      laugh to shrieks of ecstasy.

[Illustration]

    With eyes half closed in clouds that ooze
      from lips that taste, as well,
    The peppermint and cinnamon,
      I hear the old School-bell,

    And from "Recess" romp in again
      from "Blackman's" broken line,
    To--smile, behind my "lesson",
      at that old sweetheart of mine.

[Illustration]

    A face of lily-beauty,
      with a form of airy grace,
    Floats out of my tobacco
      as the "Genii" from the vase

    And I thrill beneath the glances
      of a pair of azure eyes
    As glowing as the summer
      and as tender as the skies.

[Illustration]

    I can see the pink sunbonnet
      and the little, checkered dress
    She wore when first I kissed her
      and she answered the caress

    With the written declaration that,
      "As surely as the vine
    Grew 'round the stump," she loved me--
      that old sweetheart of mine.

[Illustration]

    Again I make her presents,
      in a really helpless way,--
    The big "Rhode Island Greening"--
      (I was hungry too, that day!)--

    But I follow her from Spelling,
      with her hand behind her--so--
    And I slip the apple in it--
      and the Teacher doesn't know!

[Illustration]

    I give my _treasures_ to her--all,--
      my pencil--blue-and-red;--
    And, if little girls played marbles,
      _mine_ should all be _hers_, instead!--

    But _she_ gave me her _photograph_,
      and printed "Ever Thine"
    Across the back--in blue-and-red--
      that old sweetheart of mine!

[Illustration]

    And again I feel the pressure
      of her slender little hand,
    As we used to talk together
      of the future we had planned,--

    When I should be a poet,
      and with nothing else to do
    But write the tender verses
      that she set the music to....

[Illustration]

    When we should live together
      in a cozy little cot
    Hid in a nest of roses,
      with a fairy garden-spot,

    Where the vines were ever fruited
      and the weather ever fine,
    And the birds were ever singing
      for that old sweetheart of mine....

[Illustration]

    When I should be her lover
      forever and a day,
    And she my faithful sweetheart
      till the golden hair was gray;

    And we should be so happy
      that when either's lips were dumb
    They would not smile in Heaven
      till the other's kiss had come.

[Illustration]

    But, ah! my dream is broken
      by a step upon the stair,
    And the door is softly opened,
      and--my wife is standing there:

    Yet with eagerness and rapture
      all my visions I resign,--
    To greet the _living_ presence
      of that old sweetheart of mine.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
