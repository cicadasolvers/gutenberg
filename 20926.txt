The Register of Ratlinghope.


Ratlinghope is a parish situate on the road from Shrewsbury to Bishop's
Castle, four miles west from Church Stretton and twelve miles south from
Shrewsbury, in the hundred of Purslow, rural deanery of Bishop's Castle,
archdeaconry of Ludlow, and diocese of Hereford.  The township of Gatten
is in Ford hundred.  Its area is 5,456 acres, of which 3,756 are arable
and pasture, 200 woodland, and about 1,500 common.  The population in
1901 was 197.  The surface is hilly, and the soil is sand and clay, on a
rocky subsoil.  An old Roman road, the Portway, runs between Ratlinghope
and Church Stretton, and is continued along the crest of the Longmynd in
a north-easterly direction.  In the neighbourhood are some British camps
and tumuli.

Ratlinghope, in _Domesday_ Rotelingehope, means the _hope_ or valley of
the children of _Rotel_, "Rotel" being the Saxon name from which the
County of Rutland was called.  At the time of the _Domesday_ survey,
Rotelingehope was a manor of two hides, which were waste, and was held by
Robert fitz Corbet of Earl Roger de Montgomery.  In Edward the
Confessor's reign, Seuuard had held it.  Robert fitz Corbet was a younger
brother of Roger, the builder of Caus Castle; he left two daughters, his
heirs, Sibil (or Adela), and Alice.  Sibil, who had been one of Henry
I.'s mistresses, married Herbert fitz Herbert, whilst Alice became the
wife of William Botterell.  Before 1209 Ratlinghope was acquired by
Walter Corbet, an Augustine Canon, and a relative of Prince Llewelyn ap
Jorwerth, who gave him a letter of protection.  Walter Corbet founded
here a small cell or priory of Augustinian Canons of St. Victor, in
connection with Wigmore.  Nothing is known of its history, but at the
dissolution there was a Prior and 29 Canons; and the possessions of the
Priory, valued at 5 pounds 11s. 1.5d., per annum, were sold in May, 1546,
to Robert Longe, citizen and mercer of London. {ia}

In 1845 the manor and advowson of Ratlinghope were purchased by Robert
Scott, Esq., of Great Barr, M.P. for Walsall, and at his death in 1856
they passed to his son John Charles Addyes Scott, Esq., who died in 1888,
and on the death of his widow in 1907, their son, James Robert Scott,
Esq., became lord of the manor and patron of Ratlinghope.

Stitt and Gatten, two miles north-west, were members of the _Domesday_
manor of Ratlinghope.  Between 1204 and 1210, William de Botterell
confirmed a moiety of Stitt to Haughmond Abbey.  Robert Corbet, of Caus,
also gave to the Canons of Haughmond his culture of Gateden, and an
assart situate near their culture of Gatteden.  There was a church at
Stitt in the reign of Henry II., but since the dissolution of Haughmond
Abbey nothing more is heard of it, and its district with Gatten was
annexed to the parish of Ratlinghope.  W. E. M. Hulton-Harrop, Esq., is
lord of the manor of Gatten, which, he inherited in 1866 from his
maternal grandfather, Jonah Harrop, Esq.

The Church of St. Margaret, at Ratlinghope, is a small stone building,
consisting of nave and chancel, with south porch, and a wooden bell
turret.  The original Church erected in the 12th century was no doubt the
Priory Church also.  The Rev. D. H. S. Cranage says that the mediaeval
Church may have entirely disappeared, and that there are no details which
prove that the present building is not entirely of post-Reformation date.
{ib}

The south and only door was made in 1625, and erected by Humfrey Bigge
and Thomas Bright, then Churchwardens.  The roof may be of the same date.
There are two fonts.  In 1341, Ratlinghope Church was in the Deanery of
Clun.  It was afterwards held to be in the Deanery of Pontesbury.  It is
not named in the _Valor Ecclesiasticus_ of 1534-5.  Until the dissolution
of the Priory it was considered as extra-parochial and extra-diocesan.

The Church was served by the Canons until the dissolution; and no
Incumbent seems to have been instituted by the Bishops of Hereford until
1555.  The following is the most complete list of the Incumbents we have
as yet been able to make out:--

1549.  Sir Lances Philson, clerk, curate.

1555.  Laurence Johnson, a Canon of Wigmore, presented by Philip and
Mary, and instituted 15th February, 1555.

1587.  Richard Davis, curate, presented by William Whittingham, gent.
His salary was 7 pounds 13s. 4d.

1755.  William Williams, curate.

1758.  George Hodges, born at Shrewsbury 1720, educated at Westminster
and Christ Church, Oxford, B.A. 1743.  Rector of Woolstaston 1770-1780.

1769.  David Richards, signs in 1767-70 as "Minister," and afterwards as
"Curate."

1778.  Thomas Williams.

1782.  Richard Lloyd, curate.

1795.  John Hawkins.

1833.  Edward Homfray, died 24th June, 1856.

1857.  Edmund Donald Carr, B.A. Emmanuel College, Cambridge.  Rector of
Woolstaston 1865-1900.  Died June, 1900.

1866.  William George Clutton Nottley, Rector of Alpheton, Suffolk,
1876-8.

1876.  William Henry Whitworth, M.A. and sometime fellow and tutor of
Corpus Christi College, Oxford.

1885.  Henry Anderton.  Vicar of Hopton Cangeford 1881, and of Garway
1883-4.  Resigned in 1891, and went to live at Chester.

1891.  Arthur William Benjamin Walmsley Watts, B.A. Selwyn College,
Cambridge.  Resigned 1892.  Rector of Coates, 1901.

1892.  Thomas Baker Aston, M.A. Christ Church, Oxford, Curate-in-Charge.
Rector of Habberley since 1869.  There was no Incumbent from 1892 to
1895.

1895.  William Perry Ireland, M.A. Merton College, Oxford.  Vicar of
Peter's Marland, 1897.

1896.  Thomas Robert Glenn, L.Th. Univ. of Durham.  The present
Incumbent.

The Inventory of Church Goods made 11th August, 1549, shows that there
were then at Rotlynchope "one chalyce off sylver parcell gilt, and one
cruete of pewter, one vestment of crule, one crismatory, one altare
cloth, one towell, and two bellys."  In 1553 there remained "to bellys,
[one chalice of silver] with the patent thereunto"; and another return of
1553 gives "a chales of sylver, ij belles."  The Religious Census of
Shropshire made in 1676, states that there were at Ratlinghope (in
Pontesbury Deanery) 128 Conformists, no Papists, and 3 Nonconformists.
These were the number of inhabitants over the age of sixteen.  In 1727
William Mitton was patron of the perpetual curacy.

The _Parish Register Abstract_ of 1831 contains the following account of
the Ratlinghope Registers:--

"Ratlinghope R.  Nos. I., II.  Bap., Bur., 1702-1793, Marr., 1702-1752.
No. III., Bap., Bur, 1794-1812.  No. IV., Marr., 1755-1812."  The
Registers have been very badly kept, all the earlier ones are missing,
and those of the earlier ones that remain are in a bad state of
preservation.  Nos. I. and II. are now altogether lost; they were
apparently in existence in 1876, when the Rev. W. G. C. Nottley made a
list of the Registers, and placed it in the box in which the Registers
were kept.  Sometime between 1876 and 1896 these Registers disappeared,
together with Mr. Nottley's list.

The Marriage Register 1755-1812 (No. IV. above) was formerly bound in
boards covered with parchment, but one board has disappeared, leaving the
parchment torn and crumpled, with a large hole in the centre, and the
whole book is in a dilapidated condition.  The marriage entries are on
the first twelve leaves which are loose and damaged.  It is a folio book,
containing the usual printed forms.

The Baptisms and Burials, 1794-1812 (No. III. above) simply consists of
three loose sheets of parchment, folded, making twelve pages, without any
cover.  The writing in places is nearly obliterated, and difficult to
decipher.

The transcripts at Hereford, which commence in 1660, are fairly complete,
and it would be very desirable that these should be copied and printed,
so as to make this Register more perfect.

The Registers were copied by Miss Hulton-Harrop (now Mrs. Rowan
Robinson), and were collated in 1903 by the late Rev. F. W. Kittermaster,
and have been seen through the press by the Rev. W. G. D. Fletcher.  They
are now printed, by permission of the Rev. T. R. Glenn, the present
Incumbent, at the cost of W. E. M. Hulton-Harrop, Esq., of Gatten Lodge
and Lythwood Hall, who has generously presented these Registers to the
Society.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
