_Recipes of Universal Appeal_

In presenting these recipes great care has been exercised to select
only those that will be popular in every home, in order that the new
Dr. Price Cook Book will be useful every meal every day the year
through.

Herein will be found many famous recipes, made more appealing than
ever by the use of Dr. Price's Phosphate Baking Powder--recipes that
meet present-day conditions by economizing in eggs and other expensive
ingredients.

Here also are many new and unusual recipes, easily prepared by the
beginner but so excellent that they will add new laurels even to the
reputation of the expert, if perfection is maintained by the use of
Dr. Price's Phosphate Baking Powder.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS


Where shortening is mentioned in the recipes it is understood that
butter or lard, or an equivalent quantity of butter substitute or
vegetable oil may be used.


MEASUREMENTS

All measurements for all materials called for in the recipes in this
book are level.

The standard measuring cup holds one-half pint and is divided into
fourths and thirds.

To make level measurements fill cup or spoon and scrape off excess
with back of knife.

One-half spoon is measured lengthwise of spoon.

Sift flour before measuring.


BAKING

Much depends upon the baking. Many a cake otherwise perfectly prepared
is spoiled because the oven is too hot or not hot enough. Regulate the
oven carefully before mixing the ingredients.

When a cake is thoroughly baked it shrinks from the sides of the pan.
A light touch with the finger which leaves no mark is another
indication that the cake is baked.


TABLE OF EQUIVALENT WEIGHTS AND MEASURES

1 saltspoon = 1/4 teaspoon
3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon
16 tablespoons = 1 cup
2 cups = 1 pint
2 pints = 1 quart
4 cups = 1 quart
2 cups granulated sugar = 1 pound
4 cups flour = 1 pound
2 cups butter = 1 pound
2 tablespoons butter = 1 ounce
2 tablespoons liquid = 1 ounce
4 tablespoons flour = 1 ounce
1 square unsweetened chocolate = 1 ounce
3-1/2 tablespoons cocoa = 1 ounce




BREADS, BISCUITS AND ROLLS


Dr. Price's Baking Powder may be used instead of yeast to leaven
bread. It does precisely the same work; that is, raises the dough,
making it porous and spongy. The great advantage of bread made by this
method is in time saved, as it can be mixed and baked in less than two
hours. Milk bread needs little or no shortening, and less flour is
required than when water is used. Sift flour before measuring, and use
level measurements for all materials.


BAKING POWDER BREAD

4 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
7 teaspoons Dr. Price's Baking Powder
1 medium-sized, cold, boiled potato
Milk (water may be used)

Sift thoroughly together flour, salt, sugar and baking powder, rub in
potato; add sufficient liquid to mix rapidly and smoothly into soft
dough. This will require about one pint of liquid. Turn at once into
greased loaf pan, smooth top with knife dipped in melted butter, and
allow to stand in warm place about 30 minutes. Bake in moderate oven
about one hour. When done take from pan, moisten top slightly with
cold water and allow to cool before putting away.


BOSTON BROWN BREAD

1 cup entire wheat or graham flour
1 cup corn meal
1 cup rye meal or ground rolled oats
1 teaspoon salt
5 teaspoons Dr. Price's Baking Powder
3/4 cup molasses
1-1/3 cups milk

Mix thoroughly dry ingredients; add molasses to milk, and add; beat
thoroughly and put into greased moulds 2/3 full. Steam 3-1/2 hours;
remove covers and bake until top is dry.


CORN BREAD

1 cup corn meal
1 cup flour
4 teaspoons Dr. Price's Baking Powder
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1-1/2 cups milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons shortening

Mix and sift dry ingredients; add milk, beaten egg, and melted
shortening; beat well and pour into greased shallow pan. Bake in hot
oven about 25 minutes.


SPIDER CORN BREAD

1 egg
1-3/4 cups milk
2 tablespoons sugar
1 cup corn meal
1/3 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons Dr. Price's Baking Powder
1 tablespoon shortening

Beat egg and add one cup milk; stir in sugar, corn meal, flour, salt
and baking powder which have been sifted together; turn into frying
pan in which shortening has been melted; pour on remainder of milk,
but do not stir. Bake about 25 minutes in hot oven. There should be a
line of creamy custard through the bread. Cut into triangles and
serve.


GRAHAM BREAD

1-1/2 cups flour
1-1/2 cups graham flour
4 teaspoons Dr. Price's Baking Powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon shortening
1 egg
1-1/2 cups liquid (1/2 water and 1/2 milk)
2 tablespoons sugar or molasses

Mix flour, graham flour, baking powder and salt together; rub in
shortening; beat egg and add with sugar or molasses to liquid; stir
into dry mixture and beat well; add more milk if necessary to make a
drop batter. Put into greased loaf pan, smooth with knife dipped in
cold water. Bake about one hour in moderate oven.


NUT OR RAISIN BREAD

2-1/2 cups flour
1/2 cup graham flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup walnuts or raisins
4 teaspoons Dr. Price's Baking Powder
1 egg
1-1/2 cups milk

Sift dry ingredients together. Add raisins or nuts chopped not too
fine; add beaten egg to milk and add to dry ingredients to make a soft
dough. Put into greased loaf pan. Allow to stand about 30 minutes.
Bake in moderate oven from 45 to 60 minutes.


PEANUT BUTTER BREAD

2 cups flour
4 teaspoons Dr. Price's Baking Powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup milk
2/3 cup peanut butter or 1/2 cup finely ground peanuts

Sift flour, baking powder, salt and sugar together. Add milk to peanut
butter or peanuts, blend well and add to dry ingredients; mix
thoroughly. Bake in greased loaf pan in slow oven 45 to 50 minutes.
This is best when a day old. It makes delicious sandwiches cut in thin
slices and filled with either cream cheese or lettuce and mayonnaise.

1 tablespoon shortening
1-1/2 cups milk

CAKE


The baking of cake is of primary importance. Regulate the oven before
putting materials together. When a cake is baked it shrinks from the
sides of the pan. A light touch with the finger which leaves no mark
is another indication that the cake is baked. Small and layer cakes
require a hotter oven than loaf cakes.

Where fewer eggs than called for are used, increase the amount of Dr.
Price's Baking Powder about one teaspoon for each egg omitted.

If an unsalted shortening is used take slightly less and add a small
quantity of salt.

Sift flour before measuring and use level measurements for all
materials.

PASTRY


A small amount of Dr. Price's Baking Powder will make pastry lighter,
more tender and more digestible.

Pastry should rise in baking to double its thickness, and be in light,
flaky, tender layers. The novice must learn to handle it lightly and
as little as possible in rolling and turning. All materials should be
cold and pastry is improved if put into the icebox as soon as made and
allowed to stand several hours before using.

Pastry flour is better than bread flour for pie crust.

very lightly with tips of fingers. Add cold water very slowly, enough
to hold dough together (do not work or knead dough). Divide in halves;
roll out one part very thin on floured board, and use for bottom
crust. After pie is filled roll out other part for top. Place loosely
over pie, bringing pastry well over edge of pie plate. Trim off extra

The rules for roasting meat apply to broiling, except that instead of
cooking in the oven it is quickly browned, first on one side and then
on other, over hot coals or directly under a gas flame, turning every
minute until done. Meat an inch and one-half thick will broil in 8 to
15 minutes. Season after it is cooked.


PAN BROILING OR FRYING

Put meat to be broiled or fried in very hot frying pan, with very
little or no fat. Turn every few minutes until cooked. Season and
serve immediately. Steaks and chops may be pan-broiled without any fat
in the pan. For thin gravy pour a little boiling water into pan after
meat is taken out.


BOILING AND STEWING

Fresh meat should be put into boiling water and boiled over hot fire
for about 5 minutes; reduce heat and boil very gently about 20 minutes
for each pound. Salt and spices may be added for seasoning; vegetables
may be boiled in water with the meat. The broth of boiled meat should
always be saved to use in soups, stews and gravies. Salt meats should
be put over the fire in cold water, which as soon as it boils should
be replaced by fresh cold water, repeating until water is fresh enough
to give meat a palatable flavor. Salted and smoked meats require about
30 minutes very slow boiling, to each pound. Vegetables and herbs may
be boiled with them to flavor. When they are cooked the vessel
containing them should be set where they will keep hot without boiling
until required, if to be served hot; if to be served cold, they should
be allowed to cool in the liquor in which they were boiled. Very salty
meats, or those much dried in smoking should be soaked overnight in
cold water before boiling.


POT ROASTING

A tough cut of meat may be first browned in fat, then cooked in small
amount of water either in oven or in iron kettle on top of stove. This
method requires long, slow cooking.

off feet. Cut out oil sac. Lay breast down, slit skin down backbone
toward head; loosen windpipe and crop and pull out. Push back skin
from neck and cut off neck close to body. Make slit below end of
breastbone, put in fingers, loosen intestines from backbone, take firm
grasp of gizzard and draw all out. Cut around vent so that intestines
are unbroken. Remove heart and lungs. Remove kidneys. See that inside
looks clean, let cold water run through, then wipe inside and out with
wet cloth. Cut through thick fleshy part of gizzard and remove inside
heavy skin without breaking, then cut away gristly part so that only

side; return in same way, but passing needle in over bone, tie firmly,
leaving several inches of twine. Press legs up against body, run
needle through thigh, body and second thigh, return, going round bone
in same way; tie firmly. Run needle through ends of legs, return,
passing needle through rump; if opening is badly torn, one or two
stitches may be needed; or if steel skewers are used put one through
wings of fowl and other through opposite thigh. Then wind twine in
figure eight from one handle of skewer to other. Rub all over with
soft butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on rack in

FIRELESS COOKERY


The Fireless Cooker has become an important factor in the home. The
principle employed is the preservation of heat by the use of
non-conducting materials. The device ordinarily used is a rectangular
box lined on all sides with some substance which will prevent escape
of heat, with spaces or wells for stone or metal discs or radiators,
and vessels containing food to be cooked.

The advantages of this method are: the improvement in flavor
occasioned by the slower cooking with little opportunity for
evaporation, the improved appearance of food that is subject to
shrinkage when cooked by ordinary methods; the saving in labor and
time, as the cooking practically takes care of itself. Dinner may be
prepared in the morning, placed in the cooker, and without further
attention be ready to serve after 3 or 4 hours. While the time
required for cooking is somewhat longer than in the usual methods, the
actual time consumed in preparation of a meal is considerably reduced.


General Directions

Prepare food for cooking as usual. Place in special vessel, designed
to fit into wells of Fireless Cooker, and heat on range or over gas
flame until ordinary cooking temperature is reached. Put into cooker
with one or more radiators which have been heated for 10 or 15 minutes
over hot fire. For roasting, radiator should be hot enough to brown a
pinch of flour immediately. Close cover, fasten lightly so that the
steam may escape and allow cooking to proceed for time specified in
recipes.

For baking cake, apples, etc., proceed as for roasting. The time
required for baking is slightly longer than that specified for regular
ovens. For cake ordinarily baked in a moderate oven, heat radiators
hot enough to brown a pinch of flour in half a minute.


CEREALS

Prepare cereal for cooking in double boiler as usual. Boil over fire
for 5 minutes; place in larger vessel of boiling water in cooker, and
allow it to remain 4 or 5 hours or longer. If placed in cooker at
night it should remain warm enough to serve for breakfast.


STEAMING

For recipes see "Boston Brown Bread," "Poor Man's Pudding," "Christmas
Plum Pudding," etc. Prepare and mix ingredients as directed. Put into
greased molds and place in shallow pan of boiling water over very hot
radiator in cooker. Fasten cover tight and cook for 5 to 6 hours.


SOUPS

For ingredients and preparation of soups see pages 29 and 30.

Place ingredients in a vessel; cover with cold water; bring to boil
over free flame and boil 5 minutes. Fasten cover and transfer to
cooker, using one hot radiator in bottom of well. Cook 4 or 5 hours,
season and serve.


BOILED OR STEWED MEATS

Prepare meat for cooking as usual, searing in frying pan if desired
brown. Place in large vessel and cover or partly cover with boiling
water, boiling with cover fastened tight for 10 or 15 minutes over
free flame. Transfer to cooker, using one hot radiator underneath.
Cook 2 or 3 hours, season and serve.


ROAST MEATS

Prepare and season meat in usual way. Place in large dry vessel; put
very hot radiator in bottom of cooker well; place vessel containing
roast on radiator, and place another very hot radiator on top. Close
cooker and fasten. Allow it to remain about one-half hour per pound of
meat.

The roast may be browned in a very hot oven before putting into cooker
or just before serving.


VEGETABLES

Prepare vegetables as usual. Place in vessel with small quantity of
boiling water. As there is little evaporation in tireless cookers,
allowance does not have to be made for loss by evaporation. Boil over
free flame for 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to cooker, using one radiator
in bottom of well. Cook 3 or 4 hours, remove from cooker, season and
serve.

PRESERVING AND CANNING

(Material adapted from U.S. Food Administration and N.Y. State
Department of Agriculture.)


GENERAL DIRECTIONS

Test all jars for leakage before using. To do this, fill with water,
put on rubber and cover, seal and invert.

Sterilize all utensils, jars, covers, etc., by covering with cold
water, and boil for 10 minutes. Use only new rubbers and dip in
boiling water just before using.

Use wide-mouthed funnel when filling jars to avoid loss of material
and keep jar rim clean.

Invert all jars after filling and sealing.

Fruit should be sound, firm and not overripe and carefully prepared.

Clean fruit, clean hands, clean utensils, and a clean kitchen free
from flies, are essential for safety and success.

Keep products in a cool place. Avoid freezing in winter.


CANNING

Canning is the process of preparing sterilized food so that it will
keep indefinitely.

The custom of canning fruit in syrup is based on the improvement in
flavor and texture which sugar gives to fruit. Sugar is not necessary
for its preservation. Success depends upon thorough
sterilization--that is, killing the organisms which cause food to
spoil, and then sealing perfectly to prevent their entrance. Fruit may
be canned in water, in fruit juice and in syrup.


PRESERVING

The only difference between preserving and canning fruit is that sugar
is always used in preserving, while in canning it is used in smaller
quantity or not at all. In preserving the old rule of equal weights of
sugar and fruit may be followed.


OPEN-KETTLE METHOD

This method is generally used for preserves, jams, and marmalades.
Food is completely cooked and then poured boiling hot into sterilized
jars.

Prepare fruit, which may or may not be peeled, and cut into pieces
depending on the variety. Blanch or scald peaches and similar fruits
to loosen skin and chill by plunging into cold water. Cook slowly in
as little water as possible or in fruit juice or fruit syrup until
done. Fill sterilized jars, seal and invert.


CAN-COOKED METHOD

By this method uncooked or partly cooked food is packed in can or jar,
covered with liquid and both jar and contents sterilized.

Pare fruit if desired or blanch or scald in boiling water a small
quantity of fruit at a time. (See time table.) Do not blanch cherries,
sour cherries excepted, berries or plums.

Chill outside of blanched fruit by immersing a few minutes in a large
vessel of cold water. Remove skin from such fruits as peaches.

Pack fruit firmly in clean, tested jars to within one-half inch of
top.

Fill jars to within 1/4 inch of top with boiling water, fruit juice or
syrup.

Place new rubber on each jar, adjust cover and partly seal.

Place jars on false bottom of water bath and sterilize for required
time. See time-table. If the hot-water bath is used, jars should be
immersed in sufficient boiling water to cover tops to depth of about 1
inch. Do not begin to time the sterilizing until water boils. Keep
water boiling during sterilizing period.

Remove jars from sterilizer. Seal them and invert to cool. Avoid draft
on jars, but cool as rapidly as possible.

Wash jars and label. Wrap in paper or store in a dark place to prevent
loss of color of red fruit.

Vegetables may also be canned by this method.

USE OF SUGAR IN CANNING FRUIT

Sugar is used in canning fruit for the purpose of improving flavor and
is not necessary for preservation.

Thin Syrup--1 part sugar to 2 parts water for sweet fruits.

Medium Syrup--1 part sugar to 1 part water for berries and medium
sweet fruits.

Thick Syrup--2 parts sugar to 1 part water for sour fruits.

To make syrup add sugar to boiling water. Stir until all sugar is
dissolved, boil 2 or 3 minutes.


CANNED PEACHES

Have ready a syrup by boiling sugar and water together until sugar has
dissolved, using 1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar to each cup water. Allow 1 cup
syrup to each quart jar of peaches and add 1 peach pit to each quart
syrup.

Scald sound, firm freestone peaches, a small number at a time, in
boiling water just long enough to loosen skins; dip quickly into cold
water and slip off skins. Cut peaches in halves and remove stones.

Can-cooked method.--Pack peaches in overlapping layers with rounded
side upper-most facing glass. Fill each jar with hot syrup and adjust
rubber, cover, and upper clamp, thus partly sealing jar. Place jars on
rack in hot water that covers the tops to a depth of 1 inch. Bring
water to boiling point, and boil pint jars 16 minutes, quart jars 20
minutes. Remove jars, seal, and invert to cool.

Open-kettle Method.--Cook peaches in syrup until tender; then with
sterilized spoon slip them carefully into sterilized jar; fill jar to
overflowing with syrup. Adjust rubber, cover, seal immediately, and
invert to cool.


CANNED CHERRIES

Wash and pit cherries. Can sweet cherries as berries. Blanch sour
cherries 1/2 minute, in boiling water. Dip in cold water; drain and
pack closely into hot sterilized jars. Cover with boiling water or
boiling medium syrup. Loosely seal. Sterilize 16 minutes in boiling
water bath. Remove jars at once, tighten covers, invert to test the
seal and cool.


CANNED PEARS

Wash and peel fruit and follow directions for canned peaches.


CANNED BERRIES

Blackberries, blueberries, huckleberries, raspberries, loganberries,
gooseberries and strawberries should be canned as soon as possible
after picking. Hull or stem; place in strainer and wash by lifting up
and down in pan of cold water.

Pack into hot sterilized glass jars, using care not to crush fruit. To
insure a close pack put a 2 or 3 inch layer of berries on the bottom
of the jar and press down gently with a spoon. Continue in this manner
with other layers until jar is filled. Boiling water or boiling thin
or medium syrup should be poured over the fruit at once. Loosely seal.
Sterilize 16 minutes in boiling water. Remove jars, tighten covers,
invert to test seal and cool.


ASPARAGUS

Asparagus must be fresh and tender. Select tips of uniform size and
maturity, wash, cut into lengths according to containers to be used.
Scrape off scales and tough outer skins and tie in bundles to fit jar.

Immerse lower ends in boiling water for 5 minutes, then entire stalks,
for 3 minutes longer.

Cold dip, drain, pack neatly, tips up, in hot sterilized jars. Add
salt and cover with boiling water. Loosely seal, sterilize two hours
in boiling water bath. Remove as soon as time is up. Tighten covers,
invert to test seal and cool.


BEANS

String Beans and Wax Beans.--Wash, string, leave whole or break in
uniform pieces. Blanch 5 to 10 minutes or until the pod will bend
without breaking. Cold dip, drain well and pack into hot jars. Add
salt and cover with boiling water. Loosely seal and sterilize two
hours in boiling water. Tighten covers, invert to test seal and cool.


CORN

Select tender juicy sweet corn, at the best stage for table use and
can as soon as possible after gathering. Remove husks and silk; blanch
tender ears 5 minutes, older ears 10 minutes. Cold dip and cut from
cob. Pack into hot sterilized jars. As corn swells during
sterilization, leave space of 1 inch at top. Add salt and cover with
boiling water. Be sure water penetrates through the corn to the bottom
of jar. Loosely seal and sterilize 3 hours in boiling water. Remove,
tighten covers, invert to test seal and cool.




JAMS


Jams are usually made with small fruits or chopped large fruits. Cook
slowly with equal weight of sugar until thick; put into sterilized
tumblers or small jars and seal.


RASPBERRY JAM

Pick over berries. Mash a few in bottom of preserving kettle; continue
until fruit is used. Heat slowly to boiling point and add equal
quantity of heated sugar. Cook slowly 45 minutes. Put into sterilized
jars or tumblers. Other berry jams can be made in same way.


PLUM CONSERVE

4 pounds plums
1 cup seeded raisins
2 oranges
sugar
juice 1 lemon
1/2 pound walnuts

Wash plums; remove stones; add raisins and oranges which have been
sliced very fine. Measure and add 3/4 cup sugar to each cup fruit and
juice. Put into kettle, cook slowly about 45 minutes or until thick,
stirring to keep from burning. Add lemon juice and chopped nuts. Pour
into sterilized jars.




JELLIES


Heat and mash fruit until juice runs readily. If fruit is not entirely
broken rub through coarse sieve. Pour into sterilized jelly bags of
unbleached muslin or doubled cheesecloth and drain but do not squeeze.
Take 7/8 cup sugar for each cup of juice. Boil juice 8 to 20 minutes
(berries and currants require less time); add sugar which has been
heated in oven; stir until sugar is dissolved and boil about 5
minutes. Pour into hot sterilized tumblers. Hard fruits like apples
and quinces should be cut up, covered with cold water and cooked until
tender before turning into jelly bags.




PICKLES


PICKLED PEACHES

2 pounds brown sugar
2 cups vinegar
1 ounce stick cinnamon
1/2 ounce whole cloves
4 quarts peaches

Boil sugar, vinegar and spices for 20 minutes. Dip peaches quickly in
hot water then rub off the fuzz with a cloth. Cook a few peaches at a
time in the syrup, cook until tender. Pack in sterilized jars. Adjust
sterilized rubbers, and fill each jar to overflowing with hot strained
syrup. Seal jars immediately.

DR. PRICE'S PHOSPHATE BAKING POWDER

is made in the same factory in which Dr. Price's Baking Powder
containing cream of tartar has been made for nearly seventy years, and
embodies all the skill, scientific knowledge and great care used
therein.

It perfectly leavens the food and never leaves a bitter taste even if
you should happen to use more than the recipe calls for. With it you
can make a delicious angel cake with three eggs instead of eight, and
can economize in other expensive ingredients.

Safety, surety, satisfaction, form a triple guarantee that comes with
every can of Dr. Price's Phosphate Baking Powder. Use it often--use it
always and enjoy the results.

The low price at which Dr. Price's Phosphate Baking Powder is now sold
brings an economy to the home which, when combined with quality, is
too important to be overlooked.




"What Shall I Have For----?"


The perplexing home question with every woman is "What shall I have
for Breakfast, Luncheon, Dinner, or Supper?"

The mission of the new Dr. Price Cook Book is to always give the right
answer to this question, but the book will not help if it is hidden
away in a table drawer and seldom used. Keep it where it can be seen
so you will remember to ask it questions before every meal. The result
will be a surprise in delightful variety, and also in the reduced cost
of supplying the table.

When planning a meal, just run your finger down the index and get an
answer to the question, "What shall I have?"

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
