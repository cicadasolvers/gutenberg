    FOREMOST AMONG AMERICAN COLLECTORS OF
    DRAMATIC LITERATURE, I DEDICATE
    THIS BOOK




 PREFACE


 In his ably written introduction to the first edition of this work,
 Mr. John Malone makes the following statement: "It may be set down as
 a safe rule of judgment as to dramatic quality that the plays which
 were printed were fit for no more than the use to which an indulgent
 Providence and the Dunlap Society have dedicated them--to serve as
 examples of the good-will and sympathy with which a few great and
 good men in the days of our country's fiery trial held out their
 helping hands to the gentle art of drama."

 This statement, with a possible exception or two, is in the main
 correct. Few of the plays which are here catalogued have survived
 because of their literary excellence. We, however, must not look at
 the contents of this book from this view-point, but rather from the
 historical. Poorly written as many of the plays may be, they still
 possess to the student of American history an interest which far
 exceeds that of every other class of writing, the purely historical
 excepted. The _first_ play written by a resident of what is now the
 United States was _Androboros_ (the Man-Hater) written by Robert
 Hunter, Colonial Governor of New York, assisted by Lewis Morris. This
 play, or rather dramatic satire, was written to ridicule sundry
 residents of that colony, principally Dr. Vesey and several members
 of Trinity Church. This play, which was issued in 1714, was not
 followed by another dramatic production, as far as known, until _The
 Suspected Daughter_, a farce by "T. T.," was printed at Boston in
 1751. Who "T. T." was is not known, nor can I trace a copy of the
 play. Little of importance came to light previous to the Revolution,
 but that event, stirring as it was, seems to have been a stimulant to
 native ambition, and a number of dramatic productions were written
 and printed. Among these may be mentioned _The Battle of Bunker Hill_
 and _The Death of Montgomery_ by Brackenridge, then a schoolmaster;
 _The Adulateur_ and _The Group_ by Mercy Warren, afterwards well
 known as one of the foremost dames of the colonies; and several
 others, some from the Royalist side, as Sewell's _Cure for the
 Spleen_ and an anonymous production, _The Battle of Long Island_.

 The second war with England was also celebrated by our early
 playwrights, as was the war with Tripoli.

 The dramatic history of no country would be complete which did not
 celebrate the deeds and warlike exploits of its aboriginal
 inhabitants, and the American dramatist was not slow in recognizing
 the many-sided character of the North American Indian. His wars, his
 fluent oratory, his virtues, are all told, the best of these efforts
 being embodied in Stone's _Metamora_, made famous by the acting of
 Edwin Forrest.

 But all of the dramatic productions which were written prior to 1830
 did not relate to America, and a glance over the list will show many
 plays which take for their groundwork the French Revolution, the
 Napoleonic Wars, the Russian Empire and its people, while Love, that
 mysterious something which lays its finger upon all whether we will
 or no, is found, as in our fiction, in nearly all of them. What the
 dramatist, poet, and novelist would do without the help of the fickle
 goddess is an unsolvable problem.

 As will be seen by a glance at the contents of this volume, few of
 the plays were acted, nor were many of them intended for public
 entertainment. A large number were written to serve a
 purpose--political or otherwise--and when that had been attained,
 were forgotten, even by their authors.

 They show, however, what was and could be accomplished in this way,
 at a time when the average citizen had little time for aught but
 earnest, sober thought.

 When looked at from this view-point we must really wonder that as
 much remains as has been discovered. Can any country besides ours
 show a better result--at least for quantity, if not for quality?

 Among the interesting facts which will be discovered by a perusal of
 this list is that a number of the writers of early American plays
 were men who achieved success in other callings. Thus we find among
 those who found time to interest themselves in the drama and the
 production of plays, the names of Judge H. H. Brackenridge, Charles
 Brockden Browne, the first American novelist, Edward Hitchcock,
 President of Amherst and foremost among the scientists of his era,
 David Humphreys, Revolutionary soldier and diplomat, John Neal, the
 friend of Poe, Jas. G. Percival, the poet, Jas. K. Paulding, coworker
 with Irving, Royall Tyler, and Samuel Woodworth, author of _The Old
 Oaken Bucket_.

 This edition is issued at the solicitation of a number of collectors
 and librarians, who were unable to obtain a copy of the first
 edition, which was issued for members of The Dunlap Society in 1900.
 I have endeavored to make this list as complete as possible, and it
 has been to me a labor of the greatest interest. Nothing that I have
 ever attempted in bibliographical work has given me more pleasure.

 Numerous corrections will be found by comparison with the earlier
 edition, and upwards of sixty new titles are included, discovered
 since the issue of the earlier volume.

 Errors will, of course, be discovered, but I ask indulgence in those
 who find them, for as all who are interested will readily admit, no
 bibliographical work was ever perfect.

 Probably the most complete collection of early American plays, at
 this writing in the hands of a private collector, is that owned by
 Evert Jansen Wendell, Esq., of New York. Several of the titles
 contained in this volume would be unknown to me at this time but for
 the kindness of Mr. Wendell, who has given me the opportunity to
 examine his collection. Another good collection is owned by the Brown
 University Library, Providence, R. I.

 BROWN, CHARLES BROCKDEN

 CHARLES BROCKDEN BROWN, born in Philadelphia, Pa., January 17, 1771,
 died there, February 22, 1810, was originally intended for the bar,
 but gave up that study for literature about 1796. He soon took rank
 as a novelist of the first class, and was the first American to take
 that place in English literature. His first writings were published
 in Philadelphia periodicals, notably, _The Rhapsodist_, which
 appeared in _The Columbian Magazine_. He published _The Monthly
 Magazine_ and _American Review_ (1779-1799), and edited _The Literary
 Magazine_ and _American Register_ from 1803 to 1808. He was with
 Dunlap and Dr. Elihu Hubbard Smith, a member of the "Friendly Club"
 in New York, and one of Dunlap's most devoted friends. He was one of
 the first to advocate (in 1803) the purchase of Louisiana from
 France; and in a series of articles published in that year strongly
 urged the progressive territorial extension of the Union. He was
 married in November, 1804, to Miss Elizabeth Linn, daughter of Rev.
 Dr. William Linn of New York, and thus became the brother-in-law of
 John Blair Linn, between whom and himself a lifelong attachment of
 affection existed.

 BURK, JOHN DALY

 JOHN DALY BURK, born in Ireland about 1776, died in 1808, became,
 while at Trinity College, Dublin, an ardent politician, and involved
 himself in difficulties with the authorities. It is said he belonged
 to a secret political society which tried to rescue a rebel on his
 way to execution. Burk took shelter in a bookseller's shop, while his
 wolf-dog kept the police at bay. Escaping in woman's apparel, given
 him by a Miss Daly, whose name he afterwards added to his own, he
 came to America, settled in Boston, and became editor of a newspaper
 called _The Polar Star and Boston Daily Advertiser_. He afterwards
 settled in New York, and published a paper called _The Time-Piece_.
 Arrested on a charge of publishing a libel contrary to the provisions
 of the Sedition Law of 1798, he left New York and settled at
 Petersburg, Va. In 1804 he published a _History of Virginia_, in 4
 vols., the fourth being issued after his death. He also wrote a
 _History of the Late War in Ireland, with an Account of the United
 Irish Association, from the First Meeting in Belfast, to the Landing
 of the French at Killala_, published in Philadelphia, 1799. Also _An
 Historical Essay on the Character and Antiquity of Irish Songs_,
 published in _The Richmond Enquirer_, May, 1808. He was killed in a
 duel with a French man named Coquebert.

 CHAPMAN, SAMUEL H.

 SAMUEL HENRY CHAPMAN, born in London, May 10, 1799; died in
 Philadelphia, May 16, 1830, was an actor as well as dramatist. He
 made his first appearance on the stage at Covent Garden Theatre,
 London, as _Agib_, in _Timour, the Tartar_. He was brought to the
 United States in 1827 by Mr. Francis Courtney Wemyss, manager of the
 Chestnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, in company with Mr. and Mrs.
 Sloman, Mrs. Austin, and Miss Emery, for the stock company of that
 theatre. His debut was made October 31, 1827, as _Pierre_ in _Venice
 Preserved_. He became a favorite immediately, and of him it is said
 he had no equal in heroic roles in his time. In May, 1829, he became
 joint manager of the Walnut Street Theatre. He married Elizabeth
 Jefferson, daughter of the elder and aunt of the now living Joseph
 Jefferson, in the same year. While riding, to illustrate to an artist
 the scene of the robbery in Turner's Lane in his own play of _The
 Mail Coach_, he was thrown from his horse, and so injured that he
 died within a week. It is said his hurt was aggravated greatly by the
 fact that he continued to play every night, and having a piece of
 brass armor next his skin, blood-poisoning was caused in his wounded
 shoulder.

 the war between the States, and used as a place of burial for the
 Federal dead, was purchased from General Lee's heirs at the close of
 the war and remains dedicated to the uses of a National Cemetery. Mr.
 Custis wrote _Recollections of General Washington_, published first

 DA CENEDA, LORENZO DA PONTE

 (_Called DA PONTE_)

 LORENZO DA PONTE DA CENEDA; born in Venice, Italy, in 1748; died in
 New York, August 17, 1838, was an ardent poet and dramatist, and was
 attached to the Court Theatre at Vienna in 1784, where several of his
 librettos were produced with success. He came to New York about 1809,
 and established himself as a teacher of languages, finally becoming
 Professor of Italian Literature in Columbia College. He was a very
 popular figure in New York society, and dearly loved by his
 compatriots, to whom he gave an affectionate welcome upon their
 coming to his new home. He was an intimate associate of Mozart,
 Metastasio, and Joseph II. of Austria. Upon the arrival of the first
 Italian opera of Signor Garcia and his illustrious daughter in New
 York, they found that Da Ponte had made their way to triumph easy. He
 was, in fact, the foster-father of Italian opera in America.

 DUNLAP, WILLIAM

 WILLIAM DUNLAP, rightly called the father of the American stage, was
 born in Perth Amboy, N. J., February 19, 1766, and died in New York,
 September 28, 1839. He came to New York in 1777 and commenced the
 study of painting, for which he had an early inclination. In 1784 he
 went to London, where for three years he worked under Benjamin West.
 On his return he became interested in the drama, and wrote his first
 play. He soon after became closely identified with the theatre, and
 appeared on the stage. In 1796 he became manager of the John Street
 Theatre, and, soon after, sole manager of the New Park Theatre. In
 1805 he retired from the management a bankrupt, and devoted himself
 to his original profession of painting. In 1814 he received the
 appointment of Assistant Paymaster General of the New York State
 Militia. In 1817 he again took up the brush, and exhibited some of
 his large paintings in most of the cities of the United States. He
 was founder and vice-president of the National Academy of Design. He
 wrote _The Life of George Frederick Cooke_ and _A History of the Rise
 and Progress of the Arts of Design in America_--a most valuable work.
 He also wrote a number of other works on different subjects.

 studied law in Boston, and wrote for _Russell's Gazette and Farmer's
 Museum_, in which his prose papers, _Common Sense in Deshabille_,
 became quite popular. They were published in a volume in 1799. He
 also contributed to a literary paper called _The Nightingale_ in
 1796. In 1809 he edited the _Boston Patriot_, and in 1812 _The
 Pilot_, a paper in the interest of De Witt Clinton for the
 Presidency. He left Boston in 1813 for Marietta, Ohio, with the
 purpose of establishing a newspaper there, but death interrupted his
 plans.

 S. L. FAIRFIELD, born in Warwick, Mass., June 25, 1803, died in New
 Orleans, La., March 6, 1844, entered Brown University, Providence, R.
 I., at the age of thirteen. He studied so unremittingly, that after a
 few months he was attacked with a severe sickness. On recovering he
 was forced to leave college and seek a living as a tutor in the
 Southern States. In 1825 he sailed for London and wrote his poem,
 _The Cities of the Plain_, which appeared in the _Oriental Herald_.
 He was received by Lafayette, in France, where he published _Pere la
 Chaise_ and _Westminster Abbey_. He returned to the United States in
 1826.

 FINN, HENRY JAMES

 HENRY JAMES FINN, born in Cape Breton in 1785, died on the steamer
 _Lexington_ off Eaton's Neck, Long Island Sound, January 13, 1840,
 was the son of an officer in the English Navy, who retired from that
 service, and settled with his family in New York when Finn was a mere
 child. His early education was received at the Academy at Hackensack,
 and he was for a time a student at Princeton. While a copying clerk
 in the office of Mr. Thomas Phoenix, in New York City, he found means
 to become a supernumerary in the Park Theatre, and, having a taste
 for drawing, took much interest in scene painting. On the death of
 his father he was taken to England by his mother, and there was
 subjected to such privation that he gladly took a place in a company
 of country players. He was finally engaged at the Haymarket, London,
 where he first appeared, May 15, 1811, as Lopez in _The Honeymoon_,
 and for two seasons was an important member of the company. In 1818
 he went to Savannah, where he played successfully for a year, and in
 1820 became associated with J. K. Tefft as editor and publisher of
 _The Georgian_, a daily newspaper. In 1821 he went again to England,
 and, besides playing with success, made material reputation and
 profit as a miniature painter. He returned to America, and made a
 brilliant success as _Richard III._ at the Federal Street Theatre,
 Boston, October 28, 1822. From that time to his tragic death on the
 loss of the _Lexington_ by fire, he was a very popular actor of
 tragedy and light comedy.

    Germantown," a MS. note on an old copy in the Library of
    Philadelphia. This opera was rehearsed by the Douglas Company in
    Philadelphia, but was withdrawn, supposedly on account of personal
    allusions of a rather pointed character. The _Disenchantment_ was
    really printed in Philadelphia by Thomas Goddard, although bearing
    a New York imprint.

 NOAH FRISBIE, JR., born in Woodbury, Conn., Jan. 23, 1758, was the
 oldest son of Noah Frisbie, of the same town, who married Margery
 Post in 1752, and was in 1757 a member of Captain Ebenezer Downs's
 company of volunteers in the expedition for the relief of Fort
 William Henry on Lake George against the French. On the "Alarm of
 Lexington," Noah Frisbie with his two sons Noah and Jonathan, and
 their kinsmen Asabel, Abiel, David and James, joined the Continental
 forces. Noah Frisbie, Jr., appears on the army list at the end of the
 war as a lieutenant. No further information, except the printing of
 the under-mentioned play, is available.

    Charleston, W. Riley, 1828, pp. [37-72]. The volume is supposed to
    be by Alex. Garden, author of _Anecdotes of the Revolutionary
    War_. This I am, however, in doubt about, as the author calls
    himself "an almost beardless youth." The play is in three acts.


 GODFREY, THOMAS, JR.

 THOMAS GODFREY, who was born in Philadelphia on December 4, 1736, and

 Godfrey, the inventor of the quadrant. He was apprenticed to a
 watchmaker and remained at that trade until 1758. He was an officer
 in the expedition against Fort Du Quesne. He removed to North
 Carolina and remained there three years. He then went to Philadelphia
 and sailed as a supercargo to the Island of New Providence, returning
 from thence to North Carolina, where, a few weeks after his arrival,
 by exposure to the sun on horseback, he contracted a fever which
 terminated fatally.

 ISAAC HARBY, born in Charleston, S. C., November 9, 1788, died in New
 York City, November 14, 1828. First studied law under Langdon Cheves,
 but soon gave this up to become the principal of a school on Edisto
 Island. His first literary work was the editing of a weekly paper
 called _The Quiver_. This paper had but a short existence, and he
 purchased _The Investigator_, which he changed to _The Southern
 Patriot_. In 1822 he conducted _The City Gazette_ and wrote for _The
 Charleston Mercury_.

 The second representation of _Alberti_, in Charleston, 1819, was
 honored by the presence of President Monroe. _Alberti_ was written
 for Cooper, but he never appeared in the character. Harby is said to
 have been the finest dramatic critic of his time in America. He came
 to New York in 1828.

 7, 1767, playing in America until the close of the year 1794. He died
 in 1795, on a vessel bound for Newport.

 "It is recorded that for many years after the Revolution, Mr. Henry
 was the only actor in New York who kept a coach, and that in his case
 frequent attacks of the gout rendered it a necessity." The panels of
 the coach were decorated with a representation of two crutches
 crossed, and the motto, "This or These."

 Amherst, Mass., February 27, 1864. In 1816 he became principal of the
 academy in Deerfield, where he remained for three years. He was
 ordained minister of the Congregational Church at Conway, Mass., in

 History in Amherst College. He continued his connection with the
 college, having been appointed to the presidency with the
 professorship of Natural Theology and Geology, until his resignation
 in 1854. He was the author of numerous scientific and theological
 works. The tragedy mentioned below is his first and probably his only

    Adventure_, which Dunlap had submitted to Hodgkinson some years
    previously, and declares that the latter seemed unconscious of any
    wrong-doing.

 HOPKINSON, FRANCIS

 FRANCIS HOPKINSON, born in Philadelphia, Pa., September 21, 1737,
 died there May 9, 1791, was the son of Thomas Hopkinson. Francis was
 educated at the College of Philadelphia, studied law under Benjamin
 Chew, and was admitted to the bar in 1761. His career belongs to the
 public history of the making of the United States. To enumerate his
 works and honors would transcend the scope of this book. He was a
 member of the Continental Congress in 1776, signed the Declaration of
 Independence, and was the first head of the treasury department of
 the new government. The first powerful satire of the British in
 Revolution, _The Battle of the Kegs_, was from his pen. A ripe
 scholar and a prolific writer of prose and verse in both humorous and
 earnest methods, skilled in music and in polite conversation, he was
 one of the most brilliant of the group of early jurists and writers
 of our country. He was United States District Judge of Pennsylvania
 at the time of his death. The authorship of the two anonymous college
 dialogues cited below is positively given to him in the Brinley
 Catalogue (New York, March, 1880), in view of which, and of the not
 less important fact that Thomas Hopkinson died in 1751, I think,
 notwithstanding the statement made by a contemporary newspaper, that
 the Dialogue of the 1776 commencement was his work. Of that occasion
 Sanderson's _Biography of the Signers of the Declaration of
 Independence_ says in the memoir of Francis Hopkinson: "Among the
 records of a public commencement of that institution [the College of
 Philadelphia], held on the twentieth of May, 1766, the board of
 trustees, comprising the governor, chief justice and most
 distinguished men of the province, passed the following resolution:
 'After the business of the commencement was finished, it was resolved
 that as Francis Hopkinson (who was the first scholar entered in this
 seminary at its opening and likewise one of the first who received a
 degree in it) was about to embark for England and has always done
 honor to the place of his education by his abilities and good morals,
 as well as rendered it many substantial services on all public
 occasions, the thanks of this institution ought to be delivered to
 him in the most affectionate manner.'"

 HOPKINSON, THOMAS

 THOMAS HOPKINSON, born in London, England, April 6, 1709, died in
 Philadelphia, Pa., November 5, 1751, was son of a London merchant. In
 1731, having been admitted to the bar, he settled in Philadelphia,
 where he became a deputy, and finally principal clerk of the Orphan's
 Court. For many years he was a member of the council of the province
 and a judge of court. Always interested in letters and science, he
 became the intimate friend of Franklin, to whom he suggested the use
 of metal points for the purpose of obtaining electric sparks. The
 Library Company, the College of Philadelphia, and the Philosophical
 Society named him among their incorporators and earliest officers.
 Perhaps his greatest distinction now is that he was the father of
 Francis Hopkinson, who may have caused the under-mentioned dialogue
 to be produced "for remembrance."

 major.

 In 1780 he was made a colonel and aide-de-camp to Washington. He was
 custodian of the standards, surrendered at Yorktown and was presented

 treaties with foreign powers.

 He resided at Mount Vernon until the framing of the Constitution,

 country in 1791. He was afterwards appointed to represent the United
 States at Madrid, and during this time concluded treaties of peace
 with Tripoli and Algiers. He was the author of a number of works,
 including a Life of General Israel Putnam.

    First played at the Philadelphia Theatre, 1790. The announcement

    17, 1791, was in these words:

    _The Widow of Malabar; or, The Tyranny of Custom._ A play in five
    acts, written by a citizen of the United States (acted at
    Philadelphia and Baltimore with great applause), with a prologue
    by J. Trumbull, LL.D.

 HUNTER, ROBERT

 ROBERT HUNTER was born in England, and was appointed governor of New

 which has been ascribed to Swift.

  ANDROBOROS. A Bographical Farce, in Three Acts, viz., The Senate,
      The Consistory, And The Apotheosis. By Governour Hunter.

    Printed at Monoropolis since 1st August, 1714.

    The first dramatic piece published in America.

    It is a severe criticism of the clergy, members, and others of
    Trinity Church, the principal among whom was Dr. Vesey.

    The piece is excessively rare, and mentioned by few
    bibliographers, and then only by the first word of the title. It
    was published anonymously, and printed by Wm. Bradford in 1714.
    Only one copy is known, now in the collection of the Duke of
    Devonshire. A manuscript copy of it is in the collection of Evert
    Jansen Wendell, Esq., of New York.

    The copy owned by the Duke of Devonshire formerly belonged to John
    Philip Kemble, the tragedian. It contains a number of manuscript
    corrections, probably from the hand of the author, among them the
    word "Bographical" on the title-page, which is changed to
    "Biographical"; "Monoropolis," which is changed to "Moropolis."
    The title-page has been torn at the bottom, and the figures 14
    appear in ink.

    The following lines have been written in this copy by Kemble:

    "Androboros, etc. Printed at Mosicropolis. Whoever made the
    correction meant, I suppose, to imply that it was printed at Moros
    Polis--'Foolstown.' The corrections that run all through the
    piece, and the key to the characters, make me suppose that this
    was the author's copy."

    On the title, Kemble has written, "Collated and perfect, J. P. K.,
    1798."

    Gov. Hunter was assisted in the writing of this piece by Chief
    Justice Lewis Morris.

 business occupation in Baltimore, he was admitted to the Maryland Bar
 in 1819. He had already begun to have some popularity as a writer of
 stories, and in 1823 he was led to make a trip to England, in
 consequence of the popularity which his novels had acquired there.
 While in England he wrote several articles on America for the
 _Quarterly Review_, and enjoyed an intimacy with British men of
 letters, particularly Jeremy Bentham. On his return in 1828 he
 established _The Yankee_, and was an active journalist for half a

 ROGERS, ROBERT

 ROBERT ROGERS was born at Dumbarton, N. H., 1727, died in London
 about 1798. During the French and Indian War he commanded the
 celebrated "Rogers Rangers," and participated in the siege of Detroit
 against Pontiac and the French. Rogers' Slide at Lake George is named
 after him. He went to London about 1764, and was appointed governor
 of Michilimackinac in 1765. He afterwards went to Algiers and fought
 under the Dey. He returned to America in 1775, and professed to be in
 sympathy with the patriots, but Washington ordered his arrest. He
 then threw off the mask of friendship, and raised a company of
 Royalists called "The Queen's Rangers." He went back to England, and
 his subsequent history is unknown. His best known works are his
 _Journal of the French and Indian War_, London, 1765; and _A Concise
 Account of North America_, London, 1765.

 ROWSON, SUSANNA

 SUSANNA ROWSON, born in Portsmouth, England, in 1762, died in Boston,
 Mass., March 2, 1824. She was an only daughter of Lieutenant William
 Haswell, of the British Navy, who was, at the beginning of the
 Revolution, attached to the revenue service, and resided at
 Nantucket, near Boston. His property was confiscated by the
 Continental authorities; and himself and family removed on parole to
 Hingham in 1775, and in 1777 to Abington. A cartel was finally
 arranged by which Lieutenant Haswell was exchanged and sent back to
 England with his family. Miss Haswell took employment as a governess
 in early life, and was greatly devoted to literature. She married
 William Rowson, a musician in one of the bands of the household
 troops. About the time of her marriage she wrote and published a
 novel entitled _Victoria_, which she dedicated to the Duchess of
 Devonshire, who introduced her to the Prince of Wales. She was
 enabled, by this acquaintance, to obtain a pension for her father. On
 account of the financial embarrassment of her husband, they went on
 the stage in 1792, in Edinburgh. In 1793 they came to America, and
 first appeared in Annapolis, Maryland. Thence they went to the
 theatre in Philadelphia, and, after a season there, became members of
 the Federal Street Theatre in Boston. Mrs. Rowson, who had, in 1790,
 published in England the celebrated novel _Charlotte Temple_, had
 continued writing, and the extraordinary popularity of her story of
 the unfortunate English girl made it easy for her to follow the
 cultivation of letters. She retired from the stage in 1797, and
 established a school for young ladies, which remained, during her
 life-time, the most select and popular in New England. Her last
 appearance was in May, 1797, in her own comedy, _Americans in
 England_. Her _Poems_ were published in Boston in 1804, and _Lucy
 Temple_, a sequel to _Charlotte Temple_, appeared in 1828.

    indication that they have been unable to see copies of the plays.

    intelligences, nigh head-quarters at Amboyne.

    The author had thought proper to borrow the following spirited
    lines from a late celebrated poet, and offer to the public by
    way of PROLOGUE, which cannot fail of pleasing at this
    crisis.

        _What! arm'd for virtue, and not point the pen,
        Brand the bold front of shameless guilty men,
        Dash the proud Gamester from his gilded car,
        Bare the mean heart which lurks beneath a star,_

               *       *       *       *       *

        _Shall I not strip the gilding off a knave,
        Unplac'd, unpension'd, no man's heir or slave?
        I will or perish in the gen'rous cause;
        Hear this and tremble, ye who 'scape the laws;
        Yes, while I live, no rich or noble, knave,
        Shall walk the world in credit to his grave;
        To virtue only, and her friends, a friend.
        The world beside may murmur, or commend._

 WRIGHT, FRANCES ("FANNY")

 FRANCES WRIGHT, born in Dundee, Scotland, September 6, 1795, died in
 Cincinnati, O., December 14, 1852. She became, early in life, imbued
 with French liberalism, and was an admiring friend of Lafayette. She
 first came to the United States in 1818, and was introduced in
 literary circles here by Joseph Rodman Drake. After a time spent in
 Paris she came again to the United States in 1825, and purchased 2400
 acres of land in Tennessee, at Neshoba (now Memphis). Here she
 established a colony of freed slaves. The State authorities compelled
 the relinquishment of the scheme as contrary to the law of the
 commonwealth, and the land, which was held for her in trust by
 Lafayette, was reconveyed to her. The negroes were sent to Hayti, and
 Miss Wright spent three years in lecturing on slavery and social
 topics in the United States, especially upon woman suffrage, of which
 she was the first considerable advocate. She went again to France,
 where she married Monsieur d'Arnsmont, with whom, however, she lived
 but a short time, returning finally to Cincinnati, Ohio, where she
 made her final home.

 suffice. Ireland's _Records of the New York Stage_, Dunlap's
 _American Theatre_ and Rees's _Dramatic Authors of America_ give many
 additional titles, but as unpublished plays really do not deserve a
 place in a bibliography, I have inserted this list only for the

material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
