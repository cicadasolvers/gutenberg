TO THE NOBLE SOCIETY OF COLLEDGE-YOUTHS.


GENTLEMEN,

I have seen a Treatise intituled, _de Tintinnabulis_--that
is, of little Bells, the Language Latin, but pen'd by a
_Dutchman_, being a Discourse of striking tunes on little
Bells with traps under the feet, with several Books on several
Instruments of Music, and Tunes prick't for the same; Then
considering that the Well-wishers to either of them, took
great pains to make plain the use of them, I thought it worth
a Dayes labour, to write something on this Art or Science,
that the Rules thereof might not be lost and obscured to some,
as the _Chronicles_ before _William_ the Conqueror, being given
only by Tradition from Father to Son. Wherefore I humbly intreat
you favourably to accept this small Treatise, as a foundation
whereon may be raised a famous Structure; and if any one objects
a fault, excuse it with the Ringing term--He was Over-bell'd--So
you will much oblige him that is a Well-wisher to your Recreation,

                                                       CAMPANISTA.




On the Ingenious Art of RINGING.


    What Musick is there that compar'd may be
    To well-tun'd Bells enchanting melody!
    Breaking with their sweet sound the willing Air,
    And in the listning ear the Soul ensnare;
    The ravisht Air such pleasure loth to lose,
    With thousand Echoes still prolongs each close;
    And gliding streams which in the Vallies trills,
    Assists its speed unto the neighbouring Hills;
    Where in the rocks & caves, with hollow gounds,
    The warbling lightsome Element rebounds.
    This for the Musick: In the Action's Health,
    And every Bell is a _Wit's_ Common-wealth
    For here by them we plainly may discern,
    How that Civility we are to learn.
    The Treble to the Tenor doth give place,
    And goes before him for the better grace:
    But when they chance to change, 'tis as a dance,
    They foot _A Galliard, a la mode de France_.
    An Eighteenscore's a figure dance, but _Grandsire_
    Hath the Jig-steps! & Tendrings Peal doth answer
    The manner of _Corants_: A plain Six-score,
    Is like a _Saraband_, the motion slower.
    When Bells Ring round, and in their Order be,
    They do denote how Neighbours should agree;
    But if they Clam, the harsh sound spoils the sport,
    And 'tis like Women keeping _Dover_ Court
    For when all talk, there's none can lend an ear
    The others story, and her own to hear;
    But pull and hall, straining for to sputter
    What they can hardly afford time to utter.
      Like as a valiant Captain in the Field,
    By his Conduct, doth make the Foe to yield;
    Ev'n so, the leading Bell keeping true time,
    The rest do follow, none commits a Crime:
    But if one Souldier runs, perhaps a Troop
    Seeing him gone, their hearts begin to droop;
    Ev'n so the fault of one Bell spoils a Ring,
    (And now my _Pegasus_ has taken Wing.)




Upon the Presentation of GRANDSIRE BOB To the COLLEDGE-YOUTHS,
By the AUTHOR of that PEAL.


    Gentlemen of the Noble Crew
    Of _Colledge-Youths_, there lately blew
    A wind, which to my Noddle flew
    (upon a day when as it Snew;)
    Which to my Brains the Vapors drew
    And there began to work and brew,
    'Till in my _Pericranium_ grew
    _Conundrums_, how some Peal that's New
    Might be compos'd? and to pursue
    These thoughts (which did so whet and hew
    My flat Invention) and to shew
    What might be done, I strait withdrew
    Myself to ponder--whence did accrue
    This _Grandsire Bob_, which unto you
    I Dedicate, as being due
    Most properly; for there's but few
    Besides, so ready at their Q----
    (Especially at the first View)
    To apprehend a thing that's New;
    Though they'l pretend, and make a shew,
    As if the intricat'st they knew;
    What _Bob_ doth mean, and _Grandsire True_,
    And read the course without a Clue
    Of this new Peal: Yet though they screw
    Their shallow Brains, they'l ne're unglue
    The Method on't (and I'm a Jew)
    If I don't think this to be true,
    They see no more on't than blind _Hugh_.
    Well, let their tongues run _Titere tu_,
    Drink muddy Ale, or else _French Lieve_,
    Whil'st we our Sport and Art renew,
    And drink good Sack till Sky looks blew,
    So _Grandsire_ bids you All adieu.

THE ART OF RINGING.




Of the Beginning of _Changes_.


It is an ancient _Proverb_ with us in _England_ (That _Rome_
was not built in a day) by which expression is declared, That
difficult things are not immediately done, or in a short time
accomplished: But for the _Art of Ringing_, it is admirable
to conceive in how short a time it hath increased, that the
very depth of its intricacy is found out; for within these
Fifty or Sixty years last past, _Changes_ were not known,
or thought possible to be _Rang_: Then were invented the
_Sixes_, being the very ground of a _Six score_: Then the
_Twenty_, and _Twenty-four_, with several other _Changes_.
But _Cambridge Forty-eight_, for many years, was the greatest
_Peal_ that was _Rang_ or invented; but now, neither _Forty-eight_,
nor a _Hundred_, nor _Seven-hundred and twenty_, nor any Number
can confine us; for we can _Ring Changes_, _Ad infinitum_.
Although _Philosophers_ say, _No Number is infinite, because
it can be numbred_; for _infinite_ is a quantity that cannot
be taken or assigned, but there is (_infinitum quoad hos_) as
they term it, that is _infinite_ in respect of our apprehension:
Therefore a _Ringers_ knowledge may seem _infinite_ to dive so
_infinitely_ into such an _infinite_ Subject; but least my
Discourse should be _infinite_, I will conclude it, and proceed
to the _Peals_ following.

Before I Treat of the method and diversity of _Peals_, I
think it not impertinent to speak something of the _Properties_
wherewith a _Young Ringer_ ought to be qualified, and then
proceed to the _Peals_. _First_ then, before he is entred
into a _Company_, it is presupposed, that he is able to _Set
a Bell Fore-stroke and Back-stroke_, as the terms are: Next,
that he know how to _Ring Round_, or _Under-sally_: Then, that
he may be complete, it is convenient, that he understand the
_Tuning of Bells_; for what is a _Musician_, unless he can
_Tune_ his _Instrument_, although he plays never so well? To
do which, let him learn on some _Instrument_, or _Wyer-Bells_,
to know a _Third_, _Fifth_, and _Eighth_, which are the
principal _Concords_: Or otherwise, let him get a _Pipe_
called a _Pitch-pipe_, which may be made by any _Organ-maker_,
to contain _eight Notes_, or more, (according to his pleasure)
with their _Flatts_ and _Sharps_, which will be very useful in
the _Tuning of Bells_. And then this is a general Rule, begin
at the _Tenor_, or _biggest Bell_, and count 3 _whole Notes_,
then a _half Note_, or _Sharp_, 3 _whole Notes_, then a
_half Note_, or _Sharp_; and so on, until you come to the
_least Bell_ or _Treble_. For example on _four Bells_, 1:234,
here the 432 are _whole_ _Notes_, and the _half Note_ or
_Sharp_ is between 1 and 2. On _Five Bells_, 12:345 the 543
are _whole Notes_; and the _half Note_ or _Sharp_ is between
2 and 3. On _Six_, 123:456 the _half Note_ or _Sharp_ is
between 3 and 4. On _Eight Bells_, 1:2345:678, one _half Note_
or _Sharp_ is between 5 and 6, and the other between 1 and 2.
On _Ten_, 123:4567:8910; here one _half Note_ is between 7
and 8, and the next between 3 and 4. On _Twelve Bells_,
12:345:6789:10 11 12. Here one _half Note_ or _Sharp_ is
between 9 and 10, the next between 5 and 6, and the other
between 2 and 3, which last is made contrary to the former
Rule, it being but _two whole Notes_ from the next _half Note_
to it; the reason is this, the _Ninth_ is one _whole Note_
below the _Eighth_, therefore the 2 must be a _whole Note_
below the _Treble_, otherwise they would not be a true _Eighth_,
therefore the _half Note_ is put between 2 and 3. Now he that
hath these Rules, and a good ear to judge of the _Concords_,
may at any time cast his Verdict (as to Bells, whether they
are well in _Tune_ or not) amongst the chief of the _Company_.




Of the _Changes_.


A _Change_ is made between _two Bells_ that strikes next
to each other, by removing into each others places, as in
these _two Figures_ 1, 2. make a _Change_ between them,
and they will stand 2, 1. which is called a _Change_;
make another _Change_ between them, and they will stand in
their right places, as at first, 1, 2. These _two Changes_
are all that can be made on _two Bells_.




The _Changes_ on three Bells.


On _three Bells_ there are _six several Changes_ to be made;
in _Ringing_ of which, there is _one Bell_ to be observed,
which is called the _Hunt_, and the other two are _Extream
Bells_ (but they cannot properly be so called, because every
_Bell_ _hunts_ in the _six Changes_; yet because 'tis commonly
_Rang_ by observing a _Hunt_ and _two Extream Bells_, I will
therefore proceed in that course.) The name of _Hunt_ is
properly given to it, because of its continual motion up
and down amongst the other _Bells_, which motion is called
_Hunting_, and the other _two_ are called _Extream Bells_,
because when the _Hunt_ is either before or behind them,
that is at the _Extream_, or utmost place, there is a _Change_
then to be made between them, called an _Extream Change_.
There are two several wayes to _Ring_ the _six Changes_.
One whereof is to make the _Treble_ the _Hunt_, and the
other way is to make the _Tenor_ the _Hunt_. I will give an
Example in _hunting_ the _Treble_, the _Bells_ are supposed
to stand thus.--

                                                               123

Now the _Treble_ must be _hunted_ up over the _Second_
and _Third_, which is to be done, by making a _Change_
between the _Treble_, and each of those two Bells in order;
therefore first I remove the _Treble_ up over the _Second_,
into the _seconds_ place, by making a _Change_ between the
_Treble_ and _Second_, thus.--

                                                               213

The _Treble_ being removed up over the _Second_, it must
next be removed up over the _Third_, as in this _Change_.--

                                                               231

Alwayes observe, that when the _Hunt_ moves from the
foremost _Bell_ toward the hindmost, then it _hunts_ up,
as in the _Changes_ next before; but when it moves or _hunts_
from the hindmost Bell, toward the Bell that leads, then it
_hunts_ down, as appears by the _Changes_ following. The
_Treble_ being _hunted_ up behind the _Extream_ Bells, an
_Extream Change_ is next to be made between them.--

                                                               321

Here you may observe, that if the _Hunt_ had been
_hunted_ down without an _Extream Change_ first made,
those _Changes_ in _hunting_ it down, would have been
the same with those that were made in _hunting_ it up.

The _Extream Change_ being made, the _Treble_ must be
_hunted_ down again before the Bells thus.--

                                                               312
                                                               132

The _Treble_ being now _hunted_ down, the next is to be
an _Extream Change_.--

                                                               123

which is the last _Change_ of the _six_.

The other way to _Ring_ the _six Changes_, is, to make
the _Tenor_ the _Hunt_, which being behind already, it
must first be _hunted_ down, as in these _Changes_.--

                                                               123
                                                               132
                                                               312

The _Third_, which is the _Hunt_, being _hunted_ down
before the Bells, the _Extream Change_ must next be made
between the 2, and 1. Which are the _Extream Bells_, thus.--

                                                               321

The _Extream Change_ being made, the _Third_ must be
_hunted_ up again.--

                                                               231
                                                               213

The _Third_ being _hunted_ up, another _Extream_ must be
made, which brings the Bells round in their right places.--

                                                               123




The _Plain Changes_ on four Bells.


On four Bells, there are _Twenty four several Changes_, in
_Ringing_ of which, there is one Bell called the _Hunt_, and
the other three are _Extream_ Bells; the _Hunt_ moves, and
_hunts_ up and down continually, and lies but once in one
place, except only when it comes before or behind the Bells,
at which time it lies there twice together; it has the same
course here, as in the _six Changes_ before set down; two of
the _Extream_ Bells makes a _Change_ every time the _Hunt_
comes before or behind them. An Example I will here give,
making the _Treble_ the _Hunt_, and the _Extream Changes_
I make between the two farthest _Extream_ Bells from the
_Hunt_. I set down the _four Figures_, representing the
_four Bells_, thus.--

                                                              1234

The _Treble_ must now be _hunted_ up behind the Bells,
where it is to lie twice together, and then to _hunt_
down before them, where it must lie twice, and then _hunt_
up again as before. The _Hunt_ is alwayes one of the two
Bells which makes every _Change_, except only when it comes
before or behind the Bells, and it moves only over one Bell
at a time; 'tis to be _hunted_ up after this manner.--

                                                              2134
                                                              2314
                                                              2341

The _Treble_ being _hunted_ up behind the Bells, as appears
by the last _Changes_, the next is to be an _Extream Change_
between the two farthest _Extream_ Bells from the _Hunt_,
which are the _Second_ and _Third_, thus.--

                                                              3241

The _Extream_ being made, the _Treble_ must be _hunted_
down again, as in these _Changes_.--

                                                              3214
                                                              3124
                                                              1324

The Treble being hunted down, there is another Extream
Change to be made between the two farthest Bells from it,
which are the Second and Fourth.--

                                                              1342

The Extream being made, the Treble must be hunted as before,
and so to the end of the Peal, making an Extream Change
every time the Hunt comes before and behind the Bells.--

                                                              3142
                                                              3412
                                                              3421
                                                              4321
                                                              4312
                                                              4132
                                                              1432
                                                              1423
                                                              4123
                                                              4213
                                                              4231
                                                              2431
                                                              2413
                                                              2143
                                                              1243
                                                              1234

The Twenty-four Changes are to be Rang another way, in
hunting up the Treble, which is, by making every Extream
Change between the two nearest Bells to the Hunt, as in
these Changes, first I hunt the Treble up.--

                                                              1234
                                                              2134
                                                              2314
                                                              2341

The Treble being hunted up, the Extream Change is to be
made between the 3 and 4, which are the two nearest Bells
to it, as in this Change,

                                                              2431

and so to the end of the Peal, making every Extream between
the two nearest Bells to the Hunt all the way.

These two wayes in _Ringing_ the _Twenty-four_, differs
only in making the _Extream Changes_, one whereof is to
make them between the two farthest _Extream_ Bells from
the _Hunt_, and the other to make them between the two
nearest Bells to it.

The _Twenty-four Changes_ are to be _Rang_ two wayes more
in _hunting_ down the _Treble_; one way, is to make the
_Extreams_ between the two farthest Bells from the _Hunt_;
and the other, is to make them between the two nearest,
as before. A short Example I will set down, the Bells
stand thus.--

                                                              1234

The _Treble_ should now be _hunted_ down, but it being
already before the Bells, insomuch that it can be removed
no lower; therefore the first must be an _Extream Change_,
either between the two nearest, or two farthest Bells from
the _Hunt_ at pleasure; the _Extream_ being made, the _Treble_
is to _hunt_ up, and so to the end of the _Peal_, in the same
course as before.

                                                              1243
                                                              2143
                                                              2413
                                                              2431
                                                              4231
                                                              4213
                                                              4123
                                                              1423
                                                              1432
                                                              4132
                                                              4312
                                                              4321
                                                              3421
                                                              3412
                                                              3142

In _hunting_ the _Second_, _Third_, or _Fourth_, there
is to be observed the same course, as in _hunting_ the
_Treble_: A short Example I will set down, in _hunting_
the _Third_ up, and making the _Extream Changes_ between
the two farthest _Bells_ from it.--

                                                              1234
                                                              1243
                                                              2143
                                                              2134
                                                              2314
                                                              3214

_First_, I _hunt_ up the _third_ over the _fourth_; the
_Hunt_ being up, I make an _extream_ between the _treble_
and _second_, and then _hunt_ down the _third_ again, as
in these _changes_, which course is to be observed to the
end of the _Peal_.

I have insisted the longer upon the directions to the
_Twenty-four changes_, because it is the ground and method
in _Ringing_ all _plain changes_; and by understanding this
aright, the Learner will more easily apprehend the course
of all _plain_ and _single changes_ whatsoever.

The _Twenty-four plain changes_ are to be _Rang_ sixteen
several wayes; in _hunting_ one Bell, it is to be _Rang_
four ways; that is, two wayes in _hunting_ it up, and the
other two wayes in _hunting_ it down, (as appears in my
directions before in _hunting_ the _treble_:) so that in
_hunting_ the 4 Bells, 'tis to be _Rang_ 4 times 4 wayes,
which makes 16, some of which I have here set down.


Treble Hunt up, Extream between the 2 farthest Bells
from it.

Some persons do observe to _Ring_ the _Twenty-four changes_
with a _whole Hunt_, and _half Hunt_; but that is an imperfect
course; for there cannot be one _half hunt_ only, but there
will unavoidably be three _half Hunts_ in one and the same
_Twenty-four_; therefore I have set down the other way to
_ring_ it, by observing a _hunt_, and _three extream_ Bells,
which course is much more easie and true.

In the _Twenty-four Changes_ are contained the _six
Changes_; the _three Extream Bells_ in the _Twenty-four_
makes the _six Changes_ in course, every _extream change_
being one of the _six_, and the _Hunt_ hunting through each
of the _six Changes_, makes _Twenty-four_: For Example, take
the _three Extream_ Bells in the first _Twenty-four_ set
down before, which are 234, and set down the _six Changes_
on them, thus.--

                                                               234
                                                               324
                                                               342
                                                               432
                                                               423
                                                               243
                                                               234

Now take the first _Change_, which is 234, set the _Treble_
before it, and _hunt_ it through, thus.--

                                                              1234
                                                              2134
                                                              2314
                                                              2341

The _Treble_ being _hunted_ up behinde, take the next
_Change_ of the _six_, which is 324, set it directly
under the _First_, and _hunt_ the _Treble_ down through
it, thus.--

                                                              3241
                                                              3214
                                                              3124
                                                              1324

And so take each of the other _six Changes_, and _hunt_
the _Treble_ through them, it will make _Twenty-four_.

I will here insert two or three old _Peals_ on five Bells,
which (though rejected in these dayes, yet) in former times
were much in use, which for _Antiquity sake_, I here set
down. And first,




The _Twenty_ all over.


The course is this--every Bell _hunts_ in order once through
the Bells, until it comes behind them; and first the _Treble_
_hunts_ up, next the _Second_, and then the 3, 4 and 5, which
brings the Bells round in their right places again, at the end
of the _Twenty Changes_, as in this following _Peal_.--

    15234
    12534
    12354
    12345

This Peal is to be Rang, by hunting the Bells down,
beginning with the Tenor, next the fourth, and so the
third, second, and treble, which will bring the Bells
round in course as before.




An Eight and Forty.


In this _Peal_, the _Fifth_ and _Fourth_ are both _whole
Hunts_, each of which does _hunt_ down before the Bells
by turns, and lies there twice together and then _hunts_
up again: The 1, 2 and 3 goes the _six changes_, one of
which is made every time, either of the _whole Hunts_ lies
before the Bells, as in the following _Changes_, where the
_fifth_ hunts down the _first_; and lying before the Bells,
there is a _change_ made between the 1 & 2, which is one of
the _six changes_; and then the _fifth_ _hunts_ up again
into its place, and the _fourth_ _hunts_ down, which lying
before the Bells, there is another of the _six changes_
made between the 1 and 3, and then the _fourth_ _hunts_ up
again, and the _fifth_ _hunts_ down next; in which course
it continues to the end of the _Peal_, each of the _whole
Hunts_ lying but twice at one time before the Bells, as in
these following _changes_.

come before, as in the following _Changes_.

The _Plain Changes_ on five Bells.


There are _Six-score Changes_ to be _Rang_ on _five
Bells_, which are to be _Rang_, by observing a _whole
Hunt_, a _half Hunt_, and _three Extream Bells_; the
course of the _whole Hunt_, is the same with the _Hunt_
in the _Twenty-four Changes_, and _hunts_ up and down
in the same manner. The _half Hunt_ moves once, that
is, over one Bell every time, the _whole Hunt_ comes
before and behind the Bells; but when the _half Hunt_
is removed either before or behind the _Extream Bells_,
then there is an _Extream Change_ to be made. For Example,
I make the _Treble_ the _whole Hunt_, and _hunt_ it up;
and the _Second_ the _half Hunt_ and _half hunt_ it up,
making every _Extream Change_ between the two farthest
_Extream Bells_ from the _half Hunt_; the _Extream Bells_
are the _Third_, _Fourth_, _Fifth_: Now observe, that whereas
in the _Twenty-four Changes_, an _Extream Change_ was alwayes
made, when the _whole Hunt_ came before or behind the _Bells_,
in these _Six-score_ _Changes_ an _Extream_ is alwayes to be
made, when the _Half Hunt_ comes before or behind the _Extream
Bells_; first the Treble is to be _hunted_ up, as in these
_Changes_.--

                                                             12345
                                                             21345
                                                             23145
                                                             23415
                                                             23451

The _whole Hunt_ being _hunted_ up, the _Second_, which
is the _half Hunt_, must be _hunted_ up over one _Bell_,
as in this _Change_.--

                                                             32451

The _half Hunt_ being removed up over one _Bell_, the
_whole Hunt_ must be _hunted_ down again, as in these
_Changes_.--

                                                             32415
                                                             32145
                                                             31245
                                                             13245

The _whole Hunt_ being _hunted_ down, the _half Hunt_ is to
be removed up over the _Fourth_, which is the next _Bell_
to it.--

                                                             13425

The _whole Hunt_ is to _hunt_ up as before.--

                                                             31425
                                                             34125
                                                             34215
                                                             34251

Now the _half Hunt_ is to be _hunted_ up over the _Fifth_,
which is the next _Bell_ to it, thus.--

                                                             34521

Here the _Second_, which is the _half Hunt_, is removed
quite up behind the _Extream_ _Bells_; yet the _Extream
Change_ is not to be made, until the _whole Hunt_ has
removed down through the _Bells_, as in these _Changes_.--

                                                             34512
                                                             34152
                                                             31452
                                                             13452

And it is a constant Rule, that whensoever the _half Hunt_
has removed up behind the _Extream Bells_, or down before
them, the _whole Hunt_ must _hunt_ through the Bells, before
the _Extream Change_ is made, as in the last _Change_ but
four, which is 3, 4, 5, 2, 1. the _Second_ being the _half
Hunt_, is removed up behind the 3, 4, and 5. which are the
_Extream_ Bells; and then the _whole Hunt_ being behind,
_hunts_ immediately down; and now the _Extreame Change_ is
to be made between the 3, and 4. which are the two farthest
_Extream_ Bells from the _half Hunt_, as in this _Change_.--

                                                             14352

The _Extream_ being made, the _whole Hunt_ and _half Hunt_
are to remove again; and first the _whole Hunt_ must be
_hunted_ up.--

                                                             41352
                                                             43152
                                                             43512
                                                             43521

Now the _half Hunt_ is to be _hunted_ down under one Bell,
thus.--

                                                             43251

The _half Hunt_ being removed, the _whole Hunt_ is to be
_hunted_ down.--

                                                             43215
                                                             43125
                                                             41325
                                                             14325

The _half Hunt_ is to be removed down under another Bell,
as in this _Change_.--

                                                             14235

Now I hunt up the Treble.--

                                                             41235
                                                             42135
                                                             42315
                                                             42351

The Treble being _hunted_ up, I _hunt_ down the _Second_
before the _Extream_ Bells.--

                                                             24351

Now I _hunt_ down the Treble again, and then make the
_Extream Change_, as in these _Changes_.--

                                                             24315
                                                             24135
                                                             21435
                                                             12435
                                                             12453

The last is the _Extream Change_, which is made between
the _Third_ and _Fifth_; and this course is to be observed
to the end of the _Six-score Changes_, which is set down
at large at the end of the directions to this _Peal_.

Another short Example I will insert, which is _Second_ down,
and _Fourth_ up, (for that is the common Phrase amongst _Ringers_)
whereby 'tis alwayes to be observed, that the first Bell which
is named, is the _whole Hunt_, and the second that is named, is
the _half Hunt_, as herein you may perceive; where _Second_ down,
is meant, that the _Second_ Bell is the _whole Hunt_, and to
_hunt_ down the first _Change_; and the _Fourth_ Bell is the
_half Hunt_, and to _half hunt_ up, that is, to move up towards
the hindmost Bell the first time it moves at the beginning of the
_Peal_; which are only directions in making the first _Changes_,
for one _whole Hunt_ and _half Hunt_ may be hunted several wayes,
either up or down at pleasure. First, I _hunt_ down the _Second_.--

                                                             12345
                                                             21345

The _Second_ being _hunted_ down, the _Fourth_, which is
the _half Hunt_, must be removed up over one Bell, thus.--

                                                             21354

The _half Hunt_ being removed, I must _hunt_ up the
_Second_, as in these _Changes_.--

                                                             12354
                                                             13254
                                                             13524
                                                             13542
                                                             31542
                                                             31524
                                                             31254
                                                             32154
                                                             23154
                                                             23145

Now the _Fourth_, which is the _half Hunt_, being behind
the _Extream_ Bells, the next is to be an _Extream Change_,
which may be made either between the two farthest Bells
from the _half Hunt_, or the two nearest to it; and after
the _Extream Change_ is made, the _whole Hunt_ and _half
Hunt_ must be _hunted_ as before. These _Six-score Changes_
of _Second_ and _Fourth_, I have set down at large, at the
end of my directions to these _Changes_ on five Bells.

In every _Six-score_, the _Extream Changes_ may be made
either between the two farthest _Extream_ Bells from the
_half Hunt_, or between the two nearest to it, observing
to make all the _Extreams_ in one _Six-score_ alike; that
is, if you make the first _Extream Change_ between the two
farthest _Extream_ Bells from the _half Hunt_, you must make
all the following _Extreams_ in the same _Six score_ between
the two farthest _Extream_ Bells also; or if you make the
first _Extream_ in any _Six-score_ between the two nearest
to the _half Hunt_, you must make all the following _Extreams_
in the same _Six-score_ between the two nearest also.

The _Six-score_ plain and single _Changes_, are to be
_Rang_ Eight-score several wayes; for although there
are but _Six-score_ several _Changes_ on five _Bells_,
yet by altering the _whole Hunt_, the _half Hunt_, and
_Extreams_, the course of the _Changes_ are so altered,
that the same _Changes_ doe not come all along together
in any two of those Eight-score wayes.

With one _whole Hunt_ and _half Hunt_, the _Six-score
Changes_ are to be _Rang_, or set down eight several wayes;
one way, is by _hunting_ the _whole Hunt_, and _half Hunt_
both up; the second way, is by _hunting_ the _whole Hunt_
and _half Hunt_ both down; the third way, is in _hunting_
the _whole Hunt_ up, and the _half Hunt_ down; the fourth
way, is by _hunting_ the _whole Hunt_ down, and the _half
Hunt_ up; each of these four wayes is to be _Rang_ two wayes
more; one is, in making the _Extreams_ between the two farthest
Extream Bells from the half Hunt, and the other way is in making
them between the two nearest; for Example, in making the treble
the whole Hunt, and second the half Hunt, the Six-score are to
be Rang eight several wayes (viz.)


  Extream Changes to be made between the 2 farthest Extream
  Bells from the half Hunt.

    Treble and second both up
    Treble and second both down
    Treble down, and second up
    Treble up, and second down


  Extream Changes to be made between the two nearest Extream
  Bells to the half Hunt, which is called _Mediums_.

    Treble and second both up
    Treble and second both down
    Treble down, and second up
    Treble up, and second down

On five Bells there are 20 Hunts, (i.e.) a whole Hunt, and
half Hunt twenty times, and not one; and the same whole
Hunt, and half Hunt twice, as appears by the following
Figures, where they stand two and two together; one of
which is the whole Hunt, and the other the half Hunt: for
Example, the 2 highest Figures are 1.2 where the treble
is the whole Hunt, and the second the half Hunt. The two
next Figures are 1.3 where the treble is the whole Hunt,
and the third the half Hunt; and likewise the two last,
or lowest Figures, are 5.4 the fifth is the whole Hunt,
and the fourth the half Hunt; and so of all the rest, the
first Figure representing the whole Hunt, and the next to
it the half Hunt.

    1.2  2.1  3.1  4.1  5.1
    1.3  2.3  3.2  4.2  5.2
    1.4  2.4  3.4  4.3  5.3
    1.5  2.5  3.5  4.5  5.4

So that there being twenty Hunts, and every one making
eight Six-scores (as in the Example of treble and second)
that is twenty (which are the number of Hunts;) multiplied
by eight (which are the number of Six-scores made by each
Hunt) does produce Eight-score several wayes to Ring the
Six-score Changes.

In the Six-score Changes are comprehended the Twenty-four, and
the Six Changes: The Twenty-four Changes are made between the
half Hunt, and the three Extream Bells; and the Six are made
between the Extream Bells alone: The half Hunt in the Six-score,
is the whole Hunt in the Twenty-four; and there is one Change
in the Twenty-four made every time the whole Hunt comes before
and behind the Bells; and one Change in the Six made every
Extream: So that the Six-score rightly understood, is nothing
else but hunting the half Hunt through every Change of the Six,
which makes Twenty-four Changes: and then hunting the whole
Hunt through each Change of the Twenty-four, which makes
Six-score; for instance, in the first Six-score before set
down, where the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half
Hunt, and the 345 the Extream Bells.

I take the Extream Bells, and set down the six Changes on
them thus.--

                                                               345
                                                               435
                                                               453
                                                               543
                                                               534
                                                               354
                                                               345

Now I take the first of the six, which is 345, and set the
second (which was the half Hunt in the Six-score) to it,
and hunt it up behind thus.--

                                                              2345
                                                              3245
                                                              3425
                                                              3452

Now I take the second Change of the six, which is 435,
and set it directly under 345, and the second Bell to it,
and hunt it down thus.--

                                                              4352
                                                              4325
                                                              4235
                                                              2435

The second being hunted through the Change, I take the
third Change in the six, which is 453, and hunt the second
Bell through it, as before.--

                                                              2453
                                                              4253
                                                              4523
                                                              4532

And in the same course, the second being hunted through each
Change of the six, will make Twenty-four, one Change of the
six, hunting the second Bell through it, makes four Changes;
so that the six Changes by hunting the second through each
of them, will make six times four Changes (i.e.) Twenty-four.
And now hunt the Treble through each of the Twenty-four Changes,
and 'twill make Six-score; the first of the Twenty-four is 2345,
take the Treble, and hunt it through it thus.--

                                                             12345
                                                             21345
                                                             23145
                                                             23415
                                                             23451

Now take the next Change of the Twenty-four, which is 3245,
set it under the other Change, and hunt the Treble through
it thus.--

                                                             32451
                                                             32415
                                                             32145
                                                             31245
                                                             13245

And in the same manner, hunting the Treble through each Change
of the Twenty-four, will produce Twenty-four times five Changes,
which makes Six-score; one Change of the Twenty-four (in hunting
the Treble through it) makes five Changes.

In every Six-score on 5 Bells, there are 6 Extream Changes,
there being twenty Changes from one Extream to another.

It would be an endless undertaking to set down all these
Peals at large, but for the convenience of the Learner,
I have set down some part of several of them, which may
with ease be prickt out to the end of each Peal, as the
Learner pleases.

Note, That in the following Peals there is a Line drawn
at each Extream Change between the Figures, to shew where
the Extreams are made; as in the next Peal there is a Line
drawn between the Figures just 20 Changes from the beginning
of the Peal, the change next after the Line is the Extream
Change, which is 14352, and so of the rest; the Change next
following each Line is the Extream.


Treble and second both up, Extream between the two farthest
Extream Bells from the half Hunt.

The Changes on six Bells.


On six Bells there are Seven-hundred and twenty Changes to
be made; but there are Peals of Six-score and Twelve-score
Changes to be Rang on them. The Six-score Changes are to
be made, by observing a whole Hunt and half Hunt, which
are to be hunted in the same course, as in the Six-score
on five Bells, and the Extream Changes to be made by the
same Rule as they were on five Bells. The only difference
between the Six-score on six Bells, and those on five, are
this; whereas on five there are but three Extream Bells,
on six there are four Extream Bells. And on five Bells,
there are six Extream Changes in every Six-score; but on six,
there are but four Extream Changes. And moreover, whereas in
every Six-score on five Bells, the Changes were the same in
each, although altered in course; but the Changes on six Bells
are not the same in each, for several Six-scores has several
Changes, one Six-score having many Changes which another has
not, as in this Peal, treble and second both up, which is,

There are other Peals to be Rang on six Bells, as
Six-scores on the five smallest, the tenor lying behind
all the way. Treble and second, or treble and fifth, with
the tenor lying behind, makes very good Musick: Of which
Peals I need not give you any Example, these Six-scores
being the same with those on five Bells set down before.

The Twelve-score Changes being only part of the
Seven-hundred and twenty, and consequently the course
of each being one and the same, I will therefore shew
the course and method of the Seven-hundred and twenty,
wherein the Twelve-score Changes are also included.

In Ringing the Seven-hundred and Twenty, there is a whole
Hunt, a half Hunt, a quarter Hunt, and three Extream Bells;
the whole Hunt and half Hunt does hunt in the same course
and method, as they did in the Six-score on five Bells,
and in the last Six-score; and the quarter Hunt removes
in the same course under the half Hunt, as the half Hunt
does under the whole Hunt: for instance, when the whole
Hunt is hunted either before or behind the Bells, then the
half Hunt removes over one Bell; and when the half Hunt
is removed before or behind the quarter Hunt and Extream
Bells (at which time in a Six-score the Extream is made)
then the quarter Hunt removes over one Bell, in the same
course as the half hunt moves, when the whole Hunt is before
or behind. An Example I will set down, which is 1, 2 and 3
all up, that is to say, treble the whole Hunt, and to hunt
up, second the half Hunt, and to half hunt up, and third the
quarter Hunt, and to quarter hunt up 4, 5 and 6 are Extream
Bells; there is alwayes an Extream Change to be made when
the quarter Hunt comes before or behind the Extream Bells,
there are two wayes to make the Extreams, which are the same
here, as in the Six-score on five, and made by the same Rule,
I will here make it between the two farthest Extream Bells
from the quarter Hunt. Now the treble and second being the
whole Hunt and half Hunt, must be hunted in the same course,
as in the Six-score on five Bells, after this manner.

It is to be observed for a constant Rule, that when the
quarter Hunt removes either quite up behind the Extream
Bells, or down before them, the whole Hunt and half Hunt
must hunt through the Bells before the Extream Change is
to be made, as appears by the last Changes.

The Extream Change is now to be made between the 4 and
5, being the two farthest Extream Bells from the third,
which is the quarter Hunt, thus.--

The Extream being made, the whole Hunt, half Hunt,
and quarter Hunt must be hunted as before; and first
the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to be hunted up, as in
these Changes.

The whole Hunt and half Hunt being hunted up, the quarter
Hunt must hunt down under the sixth, which is the next Bell
to it, and then the whole Hunt and half Hunt must hunt down
again, as in the Changes following.

The quarter Hunt being before the Extream Bells, the
Extream Change is to be made:

Here are just Twelve-score Changes already set down, and
the Bells may either be brought round, and so make an end
at the Twelve-score, or else proceed forward to the end of
the Seven hundred and twenty. If the bells are not brought
round here, they cannot come round, until the Seven-hundred
and twenty Changes are all made, and then they come round
in course. To bring the Bells round at the end of these
Twelve-score Changes, the Extream is to be made between
the 5 and 4, which were the two Bells that made the last
Extream Change, and brings them round in their right places
again, as appears by these figures

                                                            123456.

There are but two Extream Changes in every Twelve-score,
wherein 'tis constantly observed, that the last Extream
Change is to be made between those two Bells which made
the first Extream, otherwise the Bells would not come
round at the end of the Twelve-score.

Here I have somewhat deviated from my directions before,
in making the Extream Changes; for in the last Change, which
is 123456, I made the Extream between the two nearest Extream
Bells to the quarter Hunt; but the Twelve-score Changes are
an imperfect Peal, being only a third part of the Changes
which are to be made on six Bells, and therefore not to be
brought round, unless the last Extream Change is made out
of course. To have proceeded forward in the 720, the last
Extream should have been made between the 4 and 6, which
are the two farthest Extream Bells from the quarter Hunt,
the Change next before the Extream, is 123546; now the 4
and 6 making an Extream Change, the Bells stand thus, 123564;
the Extream being made, the whole _hunt_, half _hunt_, and
quarter _hunt_ are to be hunted as before, and the Extream
Changes to be made between the two farthest Extream Bells from
the quarter _hunt_, which course will bring the Bells round in
their right places at the end of the 720. In every 720, there
are six Extream Changes, there being Six-score Changes between
each. The Twelve-score Changes are to be Rang with any whole
_hunt_, half _hunt_, and quarter _hunt_, observing to make
the last Extream Change between those two Bells which made
the first.

The 720 plain Changes are to be rang or set down One
thousand four hundred and forty several wayes, by altering
the whole _hunt_, half _hunt_, quarter _hunt_, and Extream
Bells (but the course of each is the same with that which
is before set down) which I thus demonstrate. On 6 Bells,
there are 120 several _hunts_, (viz.) a whole _hunt_, half
_hunt_, and quarter _hunt_ Six-score several times, and not
one and the same whole _hunt_, half _hunt_, and quarter
_hunt_ twice, as appears by these Figures.--

These Figures stand three and three together, each three
represents the three Hunts; that is, the first is the whole
Hunt, the second Figure the half Hunt, and the third the
quarter Hunt; for Example, the first three are 123, the
treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and
the third the quarter Hunt: The next three Figures are 124,
there the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half
Hunt, and the fourth the quarter Hunt; and the last three
Figures are 654, where the sixth is the whole Hunt, the
fifth the half Hunt, and the fourth the quarter Hunt, and
so of all the rest.

With one whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt,
the Seven-hundred and twenty Changes are to be Rang,
or set down twelve several wayes; for instance, take the
first three Hunts in these Figures, which are 123, where
the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt,
and the third the quarter Hunt, which may be hunted six
several wayes, as followeth.

    Treble, second and third, all up.
    Treble and second up, third down.
    Treble up, second and third down.
    Treble, second and third, all down.
    Treble and second down, third up.
    Treble down, second and third up.

Each of these are to be Rang two wayes, one is to make
the Extreams between the two farthest Extream Bells from
the quarter Hunt, and the other way is to make the Extream
between the two next Bells to the quarter Hunt.

By treble, second and third all up, is meant, that the
treble is the whole _hunt_, and to hunt up the first
Change at the beginning of the Peal; the second is the
half _hunt_, and to half hunt up; that is, to move up
towards the hindmost Bells the first time it moves at
the beginning of the Peal; and the third is the quarter
_hunt_, and to move likewise toward the hindmost Bells
the first time it removes. And by treble and second up,
and third down, is meant, that the treble and second
are to move up towards the hindmost Bell, the first time
each removes at the beginning of the Peal; and the third
being the quarter _hunt_, is to move down the first time,
which are only directions for moving the _hunts_ at first,
because they may be hunted either up or down.

Sometimes it happens, that the _hunts_ cannot be hunted
that way which is proposed, as in the 720, treble, second
and third all down.--

    123456

The whole _hunt_ which is the treble, should now be hunted
down; but it being already before the Bells, insomuch that
it can be removed no lower; I should therefore remove the
half _hunt_ down, but that being also down as low as it
can go, I should move the quarter _hunt_; and that being
also down before the Extream Bells, I can move it no lower,
unless I should move it down under the second, which is the
half _hunt_, which must not be done; for when the quarter
_hunt_ is down next before the _Extream Bell_, it must be
removed no lower; and when it is up next behind _Extream
Bell_, it is to be removed up no higher; therefore it being
now before the _Extream Bell_, the _Extream Change_ is to
be made the first of all; and when that is done, the treble,
second and third must be hunted up in course. Or if you make
treble and second down, and third up, then the first Change
is to be made, by moving the quarter _Hunt_ up over one _Bell_.
And again, if you make Treble and Tenor both up, and Third
down, first hunt up the Treble, and then the Tenor, which
is the half _Hunt_, should be moved up; but it being already
behind, the quarter _Hunt_, which is the Third, must move
under one _Bell_, and then the whole _Hunt_ and half are
to hunt in course after each other: Many Examples of this
Nature I could set down, which for brevity sake I omit.

I might demonstrate how the 720 are to be Rang twelve wayes,
with each of the Six-score Hunts, as I did that of treble,
second and third; but I think that altogether needless, since
that Example makes it most plain and easie to be understood:
But I will give a general Rule for hunting any whole Hunt,
half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, so as to produce six several
wayes to Ring the 720 Changes, which is this:

    Whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, all hunted up.
    Whole Hunt, and half Hunt hunted up, and quarter Hunt down.
    Whole Hunt hunted up, half Hunt and quarter Hunt down.
    Whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt hunted down.
    Whole Hunt and half Hunt hunted down, and quarter Hunt up.
    Whole Hunt hunted down, half Hunt and quarter Hunt hunted up.

Which is a general Rule to Ring the 720 six wayes on any one
of the Six-score Hunts; each of which six wayes, may be Rang
two wayes more, by altering the _Extream Changes_, one of which
is to make the _Extream Changes_ between the two next _Extream
Bells_ to the quarter Hunt, and the other way is to make the
_Extreams_ between the two farthest _Extream_ Bells from it.

The 720 Changes are to be Rang 12 wayes with one whole Hunt,
half Hunt, and quarter Hunt; so that with the Six-score Hunts,
it is to be Rang Six-score times twelve wayes, which makes
One thousand four hundred and forty several wayes to Ring
this 720 plain Changes.

In the 720, the half Hunt, the quarter Hunt, and the three
_Extream_ Bells, makes the Six-score Changes on 5 Bells
in a perfect course, the half Hunt and quarter hunt in the
720, being the whole Hunt and half Hunt in the Six-score;
for Example, take the 23456, and set down the Six-score
Changes on them, making the second the whole hunt, and
the third the half hunt; which when you have set down,
then take the Treble, and hunt it through every Change of
that Six-score, and it will make 720 Changes, the same with
those which I have set down before, The Twenty-four Changes
on four Bells, and the six changes on three Bells, have
also a perfect course in the 720, in the same manner as I
told you they had in the Six-scores on five Bells. There
is always one change in the Six-score made every time the
whole hunt comes before or behind the bells, which is every
sixth change; and there's one change of the Twenty-four
made, every time the whole hunt and half hunt comes before
or behind the bells, which is once in thirty changes; and
one change of the six made every extream, that is once in
six-score changes. You may take the six-score changes on
five bells, treble the whole, and second the half hunt,
before set down; and hunt the sixth bell through every
change of that six score, which will make the 720 changes;
Tenor the whole hunt, Treble the half hunt, and Second the
quarter hunt.

This is not material for a Learner to know, it being only
for the instructions of those that know how to Ring it,
but yet are ignorant of the true grounds thereof; therefore
I have dissected it, and shewed the grounds of each part
of it.

In this place, I will add a word or two to those that
practise to Ring the Changes.

They that Ring the extream bells in the Twenty-four
changes, must mind and observe the motion of the hunt,
that they may the better know when to make the extream
changes; and likewise in a six-score on five bells,
he that Rings the half hunt, must observe the motion of
the whole hunt; and they that Ring the extream bells,
must observe the motions both of the whole hunt, and half
hunt, that they may know when the half hunt is to move,
and also when to make the extream changes; or else he that
does Ring the half hunt, may give notice of the extream
changes (by saying _Extream_) the change next before the
extream is to be made. The same is to be observed in the
changes on six bells. The whole hunt is the easiest bell
to Ring in any changes, the half hunt is more plain and
easie to Ring, than an extream bell. All changes are to
be Rang either by _walking_ them (as the term is) or else
Whole-pulls, or Half-pulls. By _walking_ them, is meant,
that the bells go round, four, six, eight times, or more,
in one change, which is commonly used by young Practisers;
it may be sometimes on five bells, Ringing the Twenty-four
changes on the treble, second, third, and fourth, the fifth
bell striking behind every change; and many other changes
of the like nature may be practised this way by young Ringers.
Whole-pulls, is to Ring two Rounds in one change, that is,
Fore-stroke and Back-stroke, and in a change; so that every
time you pull down the bells at Sally, you make a new change
differing from that at the Back-stroke next before; this
Whole-pulls was altogether practised in former time, but of
late there is a more quick and ready way practised, called
Half-pulls, which is--only one round in a change, that is, one
change made at the Fore-stroke, and another at the Back-stroke,
which way is now altogether in use (unless it be at some great
bells, which are too weighty to be managed up so high a Compass
at the Back-stroke, as Half-pulls requires) it being now a
common thing in _London_ to Ring the 720 _Changes_, _Trebles
and Doubles_, and _Grandsire Bob_, _Half-pulls_, (which is
commonly Rang with so round and quick a Compass, that in the
space of half an hour, or little more, the 720 Changes are
Rang out from the beginning to the end.) And also the Six-scores
_Doubles and Singles_, _Old Doubles_, _Grandsire_, and many
other cross Peals on five bells, are commonly Rang Half-pulls.

In Ringing Half-pulls some Peals do cut Compass, that
is--the whole _hunt_ comes to lead at the Back-stroke,
to remedy which, make the first change of the Peal at
the Back-stroke.

By these following Rules, you shall know what Peals do
cut Compass, and what not (i.e.) of plain and single
changes. _On six Bells_,

In hunting either the treble, the third, or the fifth bells
down, cuts Compass; hunting them up, does not cut Compass.

In hunting the second, fourth, or sixth bells up, cuts
Compass; but hunting them down, does not cut Compass.

These Rules (leaving out the Tenor) serves for five
bells; and leaving out the fifth and Tenor, they serve
for four bells.




    The
    Twelve score LONG HUNTS:
    Or the
    ESQUIRE'S Twelve-score.


This Peal is to be Rang on six bells, having two whole
_hunts_, and one half _hunt_; the common way of Ringing,
it is to make the fifth and Tenor the whole _hunts_, and
the Treble the half _hunt_. The Tenor and fifth does each
_hunt_ down by turns, and when either of them comes down
before the bells, it leads twice, and then _hunts_ up again.

The Treble, second, third, and fourth, makes the Twenty-four
changes, one of which is made every time either of the whole
_hunts_ leads: For instance, the Tenor is first to be _hunted_
down, thus.--

                                                            123456
                                                            123465
                                                            123645
                                                            126345
                                                            162345
                                                            612345

The tenor being hunted down, and lying before the
bells, there is one change in the Twenty-four now to
be made between treble and second, thus.--

                                                            621345

The tenor is to be hunted up into its place, and the fifth
hunts down.--

                                                            261345
                                                            216345
                                                            213645
                                                            213465
                                                            213456
                                                            213546
                                                            215346
                                                            251346
                                                            521346

The fifth being now before the bells, there is another
change in the Twenty-four to be made between the treble
and third, as in this change.--

                                                            523146

The fifth is now to hunt up, and the tenor to hunt down
again, in which course they continue to the end of the
Peal, observing to make an extream change, when the
treble (which is the hunt in the Twenty-four) comes
before or behind the extream bells.

                                                            253146
                                                            235146
                                                            231546
                                                            231456
                                                            231465
                                                            231645

This Peal may be Rang by making the Twenty-four changes
Doubles and Singles, in the place of the Twenty-four plain
Changes, and many other wayes, which I leave to the Learner
to practise.




The Variety of Changes on any Number of Bells.


The changes on bells do multiply infinitely. On two bells
there are two changes. On three bells are three times as
many changes as there are on two; that is--three times two
changes, which makes six. On four bells there are four times
as many changes as on three; that is--four times six changes,
which makes Twenty-four. On five bells there are five times
as many changes as there are on four bells; that is--five
times Twenty-four changes, which makes Six-score. On six
bells are six times as many changes as there are on five;
that is--six times Six-score changes, which makes Seven-hundred
and twenty: And in the same manner, by increasing the number of
bells, they multiply innumerably, as in the Table of Figures
next following; where each of the Figures in the Column of the
left hand, standing directly under one another (which are
1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.) do represent the number of
bells; and the Figures going along towards the right hand,
directly from each of those twelve Figures, are the number
of changes to be rung on that number of bells which the
Figure represents: For Example, the uppermost Figure on the
left hand is 2, which stands for two bells; and the Figure
next to it on the right hand is also 2, which stands for
two changes; that is to say, on two bells there are two
changes. The next Figure below in the left Column is 3,
which stands for three Bells; and the Figure next to it
on the right hand is 6, which stands for six changes; that
is--on three bells are six changes, and so of the rest as
follows.

    bells   changes

       2    2
       3    6
       4    24
       5    120
       6    720
       7    5040
       8    40320
       9    362880
      10    3628800
      11    39916800
      12    479001600

The lowest of these figures are 479001600, that is, Four
hundred seventy nine Millions, one thousand six hundred,
which are all the changes that can be made on twelve bells:
And supposing that twelve men should take 12 bells with
intent to ring the changes on them, they would be Seventy
five Years, ten Months, one Week and three Dayes in ringing
them, according to the proportion of ringing 720 changes
in an hour; reckoning 24 hours to the day, and 365 dayes
in the Year.

Having given Directions for all sorts of plain and single
Changes, I will now proceed to Cross-peals, and first to
Doubles and Singles on four Bells.




Doubles And Singles on four Bells.


On four bells there are 24 changes to be made Doubles
and Singles, wherein are twelve double changes, and 12
single; next to every double change, there is a single;
so that 2 double changes do not come together in any place
throughout the Peal, neither does two single changes at any
time come together; but one change is double, and the next
is single, to the end of the Peal. Every double change is
made between the four bells; that is--there are two changes
made at one time, between the bells in treble and seconds
places, and the bells in third and fourths places. Every
single change is made between the two bells in the middle
(i.e.) in seconds and thirds places; excepting the extream
changes, which are single, and made between the two farthest
extream bells from the Hunt. An Example I here set down,
making the treble the Hunt, and I hunt it up at the beginning
of the Peal (for it may be hunted either up or down at pleasure)
and I make an extream change every time the whole Hunt comes
before the bells. In ringing it, 'tis observed, that every
bell hunts in course, and lies twice before, and twice behind,
except only when the extream is to be made, and then the two
farthest extream bells from the Hunt, does make a dodge, and
then moves in their former course, as in these changes.--

                                                              1234
                                                              2143
                                                              2413
                                                              4231
                                                              4321
                                                              3412
                                                              3142
                                                              1324

Now the hunt is before the bells, there is an extream
change made between the two farthest bells from it, which
are the 2 and 4, thus.--

                                                              1342

The extream change being made, the bells are to move,
as before, observing to make an extream change every time
the whole hunt comes before the bells.

                                                              3124
                                                              3214
                                                              2341

                                                              1432
                                                              1423
                                                              4132
                                                              4312
                                                              3421
                                                              3241
                                                              2314
                                                              2134
                                                              1243
                                                              1234

In this last Twenty-four, the treble is hunted up at the
beginning; it may be rang by hunting it down, which is to
be down, by making the first a single change, and then hunt
it up as before.

With one hunt this Peal may be rang six wayes (viz.) three
wayes in hunting it up at the beginning of each Peal, and
the other three wayes by hunting it down; the three wayes
in hunting it up, differs only in making the extream changes;
in one of the three wayes you must make an extream change
every time the hunt comes before the bells to lead, as in
the Twenty-four changes before set down. Another way is to
make an extream every time the hunt comes behind. And the
third way, is to make an extream every time the hunt comes
before and behind the bells. The three wayes in hunting it
down, are to be rang by making the extream changes, as in
the three wayes before; in hunting one bell, there are six
wayes to ring this Peal; therefore with the four bells (in
making each of them to hunt) there are four times six wayes
to ring it, which makes Twenty-four several wayes. And for
the benefit of the Learner, I have set down certain Rules,
shewing how to begin any of the aforesaid Peals (viz.)

In hunting either the treble or third up, the first change
is double; but in hunting either of them down, the first
is single.

In hunting the second or the fourth up, the first change
is single; but in hunting either of them down, the first
change in each Peal must be double.




Doubles and Singles on five Bells.


There is a Peal to be rang on five bells, called Doubles
and Singles, wherein are Six-score several changes, sixty
of which are double changes, and sixty are single; the double
and single changes are so intermixt, that two double changes
does not at any time come together in the Six-score; neither
are two single changes made next to each other in any part
of this Peal, but one change is double, and the next single,
in which course they are made to the end. Every double change
is made between the four foremost bells (i.e.) in treble,
second, third, and fourth places. When the whole hunt is
hunting up, each single change is made between the whole
hunt, and the next bell above it. In hunting down the single
changes are made between the whole hunt, and the next bell
below it, the whole hunt being alwayes one of the two bells
which makes every single change, except only when it leads,
and then the single change is made in third and fourths places;
but the extream is also a single change, and made (when the
whole hunt leads) between the two farthest extream bells
from the half hunt; the half hunt is to lie either before
or behind the extream bells, when the extream changes are
made, of which I shall shew you more anon.

In this Peal there is a whole hunt, a half hunt, and three
extream Bells; the whole hunt in a direct course does hunt
up and down, and lies twice before, and twice behind all
the way; every other bell leads twice together throughout
the Peal.

And when the whole hunt leaves the thirds place, hunting up,
then every bell that comes into second and thirds places,
does lie in each of those places twice together, until the
whole hunt comes down again into thirds place, at which time
the bell in fourths place lies there twice, and then makes
a dodge with the bell in thirds place (unless an extream
change is to be made) and so removes directly down before
the bells. And that bell which comes into the tenors place
(when the whole hunt leaves that place hunting down) lies
still there, until the whole hunt removes up into that place
again, except only when the extream is made behind, and then
the bell in fourths place moves into tenors place, and lies
there until the whole hunt moves up into that place.

With one whole hunt, and half hunt, this Peal may be rang
six wayes, in three of which the whole hunt is to be hunted
up at the beginning of each Peal, which three wayes differs
only in making the extream changes. One way, is to make an
extream change every time the half hunt comes before the
extream bells, as in the following Six-score. The second
way, is to make an extream change every time the half hunt
comes behind the extream bells. And the third way, is to
make an extream every time, the half hunt comes before and
behind the extream bells. In this last way there are six
extreams in each Peal, but in the other two ways there are
but three extreams in each Peal.

The three wayes aforesaid, are to be rang, by hunting up
the whole hunt; but it may be rang three wayes more, in
hunting down the same whole hunt, in which three ways the
extreams are to be made, as I shewed you before. The whole
hunt is alwayes to lead when every extream change is made.

This Peal I have set down at large, making the treble the
whole hunt, the second the half hunt; and an extream change
every time the half hunt comes before the extream bells,
as in the following changes. I have drawn a Line between
the figures at the extream changes, that next below the
Line is the extream.

This Peal may be rang Six-score several wayes; there being
twenty hunts on five bells (that is--a whole hunt, and half
hunt twenty times on five bells, and not one and the same
whole hunt and half hunt twice, as I shewed more at large
in the plain changes on five bells before set down) and
with each hunt, that is, with one whole hunt and half hunt,
it may be rang six wayes; so that multiply twenty, (which
are the number of hunts) by six, (which are the number of
Peals to be rung on each hunt) and it will produce Six-score
several wayes to ring it.

It may be prick't, or rang Six-score several wayes more, by
making the extream changes when the whole hunt lies behind
the bells, but those wayes are never practised; neither do
I think it material to say any thing more of them in this
place, having only inserted this, to shew the great variety
there is in this Peal. It being somewhat difficult to know
the true way of beginning each Peal, I have therefore set
down certain Rules, shewing how the first changes in each
are to be made.

In hunting the treble, the third, or the fifth bells up,
the first change in each Peal is to be made double.

In hunting the treble down, the first change is single in
third and fourths places, unless the half hunt lies so,
as that the extream is to be made.

In hunting the third or fifth down, the first change is
to be made single, between the whole hunt, and the next
bell below it.

In hunting up the second or fourth, the first change in
each Peal is single, between the whole hunt, and the next
bell above it.

In hunting down the second or fourth, the first change is
to be made double.

Every double change in all the Peals of Doubles and
Singles, is made between the four foremost bells; that
is--in treble, second, third and fourths places.




Tendring's Six-score on five Bells.


In this Peal are contained Six-score changes, which are
Doubles and Singles, there being sixty double changes in it,
and sixty single, which are so intermixt, that two double
changes does not come together in any part of the Peal;
neither are there 2 single changes at any time made together,
but one change is double, and the next to it is single; in
which course the changes are all made to the end of the Peal.
Every single change is made between the 2 hindmost bells.
There is a whole hunt and half hunt in it. The observation
in ringing it, is this: When the whole hunt lies before the
bells, and is to hunt up, first it moves up into seconds
place, where it lies twice; then into thirds place, where
it lies also twice; then into the fourths place, where it
lies once; and in the tenors place once: Then it makes a
dodge with the bell in fourths place, after which it lies
twice behind; then it moves down into fourths place, and
makes a dodge with the bell in tenors place, and then moves
down into thirds place, where it lies twice, and in the
seconds place twice, and then it leads four times; after
which, it hunts again, as before. The course of the other
four bells are exactly the same with that of the whole hunt,
in moving up and down, except only when the Bob changes are
made, and then they differ; but after the Bobs are made,
their course is the same as before; every bell lies four
times together before the bells, and twice in the seconds
place without any alteration. In this Peal are two sorts
of Bobs; one of which is called a double Bob, and the other
a single Bob. The Rule for making the double Bob is this,
when the whole hunt is hunting down, and lies in the seconds
place, and the half hunt lies behind, then there's a double
Bob; that is, two Bob-changes; one of which is made the next
change, wherein the whole hunt moves down to lead; where
having led four times, there is then another Bob-change to
be made, in which the whole hunt moves up into the seconds
place. The Rule for making the single Bob, is this, when
the whole hunt has led four times, and the half hunt lies
in thirds place; then the next change following is a single
Bob, that is--one Bob-change, in which the whole hunt moves
out of the trebles place up into the seconds place, every
Bob is a double change, and made between the two first, and
two last bells, the bell in thirds place lying still when
each Bob is made, where it lies four times together, and
then moves down; every time the whole hunt comes before the
bells, there is either a single Bob, or a double Bob made.
At every double Bob, those two bells that do dodge behind
at the first Bob-change, continues dodging until the whole
hunt moves up, and parts them: And likewise at the single
Bob, those 2 bells which do dodge behind at the Bob-change,
continue dodging until the whole hunt moves up, and parts
them, as in the following changes, where the treble is the
whole hunt, the tenor the half hunt, and the first is a
Bob-change, being supposed to be the second Bob-change of
a double Bob.

This Peal was made out of _Grandsire_ on five bells,
the Bob-changes in this, being the same with those in
_Grandsire_, and made by the same Rule.




Paradox on five Bells.


This Peal of _Paradox_ is to be rang on five bells, wherein
are Six-score changes, they are Doubles and Singles; that
is--one change double, and another single; in which course
they are made to the end of the Peal. Every single change
is made in second and thirds places, except only when the
whole Hunt leads, and then 'tis made in third and fourths
places; but the extream Changes are (also single) and made
between the two farthest extream bells from the half Hunt;
the whole Hunt lies before the bells, when every extream
change is made. Every bell lies four times together before,
and four times behind, except only when the extream changes
are made behind. There is a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and
three extream bells; the course of the whole Hunt is this,
it being before the bells, first it moves up into the second
and thirds places, then it makes a dodge with the bell in
seconds place, and moves out of the thirds place up into
fourths, where it lies alwayes twice, then moves up behind,
where it lies four times, and then moves down into fourths
place, where having lay twice, it hunts down into seconds
place, and makes a dodge with the bell in thirds place, and
then moves down before the bells, where having lay twice,
it hunts as before; each of the other bells has the same
course (in hunting up and down) as the whole Hunt until
the whole Hunt leads, at which time every bell that comes
into seconds place lies there twice together, unless the
extream change is to be made in second and thirds places.

In this following Peal the treble is the whole Hunt, and
the second the half Hunt; the extream changes are made,
when the half Hunt lies before the extream bells.

I have drawn a Line between the Figures at the extream
changes, that next below each Line is the extream; the
first extream is Forty changes from the beginning.

This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four changes
Doubles and Singles on four bells. The half Hunt,
and three extream bells in this Peal, makes the Twenty
four changes in a perfect course. There are four changes
made in the Twenty-four every time the whole Hunt leads,
which coming before the bells six times in the Six-score,
and each time lying there four times together, makes six
times four changes, which is Twenty four. 'Tis easily made
out, if you take every change that is made when the whole
Hunt is before the bells in the Six-score before, and set
the changes down by themselves (leaving out the treble)
where you will find, that the second, third, fourth and
fifth, make the Twenty-four changes Doubles and Singles,
in a perfect course; second is the Hunt, and the extreams
are made when the Hunt is before.

_Paradox_ may be rang Six-score several wayes. With one
whole Hunt, and half Hunt, it may be rang six wayes,
in three of which the whole Hunt is to be hunted up;
and in the other three wayes it is to be hunted down,
in which six wayes the extream changes are to be made
by the same Rules, and in the same manner, as I shewed
before in the Six-score Doubles and Singles on five bells;
so that with the twenty Hunts, it may be prick't or rang
twenty times six wayes, which makes Six-score.

This Peal may be prick't Six-score wayes more, by making
the extreams when the whole Hunt lies behind the bells,
but that being never practised, I will say no more of it. I
have here set down some general Rules for beginning the
several Peals of _Paradox_ by the former course (i.e.) in
making the extreams when the whole Hunt is before the bells.

In hunting the treble up, the first change is double
between the four first bells, thus.--

                                                             12345
                                                             21435

In hunting the treble down, the first change is single in
third and fourths places

                                                     (thus.--12345
                                                             12435)

unless the half Hunt lies so, that the extreams may
be made.

Second up, the first change is single in second and thirds
places, thus.--

                                                             12345
                                                             13245

Second down, the first change is double between the four
first bells.

Third up, the first change is double between the four
first bells.

Third down, the first change is single in second and
thirds places.

Fourth up, the first change is double between the four
hindmost bells, thus.--

                                                             12345
                                                             13254

Fourth down, the first change is double between the four
first bells.

Fifth up, the first change is single in second and thirds
places.

Fifth down, the first change is double between the four
hindmost bells.

If you observe these Rules aright, together with my former
directions, you may with much ease prick down any Peal of
_Paradox_.




PHOENIX. On five Bells.


This Peal has Six score changes in it, which are Doubles
and Singles; the tenor is the whole Hunt, and the fourth
the half Hunt. Every bell lies twice before, and four times
behind; every single change is made in second and thirds
places, and every bell that comes into fourths place, lies
there twice together, until the tenor comes behind; at which
time, the fourth lying in the seconds place, the next single
change is made in third and fourths places; but the tenor
lying behind, and the fourth in thirds place, then the two
next following single changes are in third and fourths places.

London Pleasure on five Bells.


In this Peal called _London Pleasure_, are Six-score
changes, which are all single. It being a confused Peal
to ring, I shall say nothing more of it, but expose it to
view, as in the following changes.

What you please. Doubles and Singles on 5 Bells.


Every bell leads four times, and lies behind twice, except
when the extream is made behind, and twice in the seconds
place, except when the extream is before; and note, when
the treble is before the fourth stroke, the single is in
second and third, the next time the single is behind; but
at other times, the single is in third and fourths places.
When any bell leaves leading, the double change is on the
two first, and two last, and the extreams are made by turns,
first behind, then before, and so on to the end, for there
are six extreams.

Reading Doubles. On five Bells.


In this Peal are Six-score changes, the treble is a Hunt;
and note when treble is in thirds place hunting up, the two
foremost bells dodge until it comes into the same place
hunting downwards; and alwayes when the treble is going
to lead, the four first bells makes the double change,
if the third be behind; but if it be before, the double
is on the two first and two last; every bell lieth twice
behind, except when the treble goes to lead, if the third
be before; and note, when it is 1, 3, 2, there is a single
in second and thirds places, which is twice, once at the
Three-score end, and Six-score end.

Old Doubles. On five Bells.


This Peal call'd _Old Doubles_, is to be rang on five bells,
wherein are Six-score changes, which are all Doubles, except
only when the whole Hunt leads, and then there is always a
single change made. It has a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and
three extream bells; every bell leads twice together all the
way, and lies twice behind, except only when the whole Hunt
leads, and then the bell behind lies there four times together,
unless the extream is made behind, and then but twice. Every
bell hunts in a perfect course, until the whole Hunt leads,
and then the single is to be made, at which time the bell
in seconds place lies there twice (unless the extream is made
in second and thirds place) and every single change is made
in third and fourths places, except the extreams which are
(in this Peal) made by the same rule and after the same
manner, as I shewed before in the Six-score call'd Doubles
and Singles on five bells. In making the single changes in
third and fourths places, it is observed, that the bell which
lies in fourths place (the change next before the single) is
hunting up; and in making the single change, it does dodge
with the bell in thirds place, and so hunts up behind; and
likewise the bell that lies in thirds place (in the change
next before the single) is hunting down, and in making the
single it does dodge with the bell in fourths place, and
then hunts directly down.

In this following Peal, the treble is the whole Hunt, the
second the half Hunt, and an extream change is alwayes made,
when the half Hunt lies before the extream bells next to the
whole Hunt; every extream is made between the two farthest
extream bells from the half Hunt, as in the following changes.

This Peal of _Old Doubles_, is grounded on the Twenty-four
changes Doubles and Singles on four bells, which are made
in a perfect course herein; every time the whole Hunt leads,
there are two changes made in the Twenty-four; the half Hunt,
and three extream bells, makes the Twenty-four changes, and
every single change in this Peal, is a single change in the
Twenty-four.

This Peal may be rang Six-score several wayes; with one
whole Hunt, and half Hunt, it is to be rang six wayes
(i.e.) three wayes in hunting up the whole Hunt at the
beginning of the Peal, and the other wayes in hunting
it down; in which six wayes, the Extream Changes are
to be made by the same rule, and in the same manner,
as those in the Six-score Doubles and Singles on five
Bells, and _Paradox_ before set down; so that with the
twenty Hunts, it may be rang twenty times six wayes,
which makes Six-score.

In these Six-score wayes, the whole Hunt is before the
Bells when every single Change is made; but it may be rang
Six-score several wayes more, by making the single Changes
when the whole Hunt lies behind them, which being never
practised, I will say no more of it.

For the convenience and benefit of the Practitioner,
I have set down certain rules, shewing how to begin each
Peal of _Old Doubles_ (with any Hunt) by the former course
(i.e.) in making the single Changes, when the whole Hunt
lies before the Bells, these Rules serving only for moving
the whole Hunt at the beginning of each Peal, for it may
be hunted either up or down.

In hunting either the treble, third, or fifth Bells up,
the first change is made between the four foremost Bells,
thus.--

                                                             12345
                                                             21435

--The treble down, the first change is single in third and
fourths places, unless the half Hunt lies so, as that the
Extream is to be made.

--The third or fifth down, the first change is between
the four hindmost Bells, thus.--

                                                             12345
                                                             13254

--The second or fourth up, the first change is between
the four hindmost Bells.

--The second or fourth down, the first change between the
four foremost Bells.

In ringing any of these Peals, where the first change is
made between the four hindmost Bells, it must be made at
the Back-stroke, otherwise the Bells will cut Compass all
the way; every double change is made either between the
four foremost, or four hindmost bells.




New Doubles. On five Bells.


In this Peal of _New Doubles_, there are Six-score Changes,
which are all double, except only when the whole Hunt leads,
and then there is alwayes a single Change made; it has a
whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three Extream Bells. The whole
Hunt has a perfect course in hunting up and down, and lies
twice before, and twice behind. When the whole Hunt leaves
the thirds place hunting up, then each Bell that comes into
that place, lies there twice, and then moves up behind; and
the Bells in treble and seconds places, does continue dodging
from the time that the whole Hunt hunts up out of thirds
place, until it comes into that place again hunting down; and
that Bell which comes into thirds place (when the whole Hunt
leaves it hunting down, lies there twice, and then moves up
behind) and the next Bell that comes into that place, lies
there twice also, and then moves down before the Bells. But
note, that Bell which lies in the thirds place (in the Change
next before the Extream) continues there, until the whole
Hunt hunts up into that place, and then it moves down; when
the whole Hunt leads the Bell in seconds place, lies there
twice together, and then moves down before the Bells; and
every Bell that comes behind, lies there twice, except only
in the Change next before, and that next after the whole Hunt
leads; every single Change is made in third and fourths
places, except the Extreams, which are also single Changes,
and made between the two hindmost Bells, when the half Hunt
lies before the Extream Bells next to the whole Hunt.

These directions are only for Ringing this Peal next
following; but it may be Rang many other wayes, by making
the Extream Changes in other places, of which I shall speak
more anon.

This Peal may be Rang Six-score several wayes. With one
whole Hunt, and half Hunt, it may be Rang six wayes; in
three of which, the whole Hunt is to be hunted up, and
in the other three wayes it is to be hunted down; which
six wayes are to be Rang, by making the Extream changes
by the same rules, and in the same manner, as in Doubles
and Singles on five Bells, _Old Doubles_, and _Paradox_,
before set down; so that with the twenty Hunts, it may be
Rang twenty times six wayes; which makes Six-score.

This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four Changes, Doubles
and Singles on four Bells, the half Hunt and three Extream
Bells makes the Twenty-four Changes in perfect course; and
in the same manner, as I shewed you in _Paradox_, and _Old
Doubles_.

These following rules shews how to begin any Peal of
_New Doubles_.

In hunting either the treble or fourth up, the first change
must be double between the two first, and two last Bells,
thus.--

                                                             12345

In hunting the treble down, the first change is single in
third and fourths places, unless the extream is to be made.

--The fourth down, the first change is between the four
first Bells.

Second up, first change double between the four hindmost
Bells.

Second down, the first change is double between the two
first, and two last Bells.

Third up, first change double between the four foremost
Bells.

Third down, first change double between the four hindmost
Bells.

Fifth up, double between the four first Bells.

Fifth down, first change double, two first and two last
Bells.




Grandsire on five Bells.


_Grandsire_ is the best and most ingenious Peal that ever was
composed, to be rang on five bells, it having no dependance
on the course of any other Peal. There are Sixscore changes
in it, in pricking of which, there is the greatest variety of
any other Peal whatsoever; for it may be prick't or rang some
thousands of wayes. The common way of ringing it, is to make
the Bobs and single changes when the whole Hunt leads, which
course and method I will first set down, and afterward say
something of the other wayes in ringing it. It has a whole
hunt and half hunt, the changes are all double except two,
which are single. The whole hunt has a perfect course in
hunting up and down, and lies twice together before, and
twice behind all the way; every other bell has the same
course as the whole hunt, in moving and hunting up and down;
and each bell lead twice together all the way, and lie twice
together behind, except only at the Bobs. Every Bob-change is
made between the two first and two last bells, the bell in
thirds place lies full when every Bob-change is made, and
then moves down; and every other double change is made between
the four bells that stand together (viz.) either the four
first, or four last bells. There are two sorts of Bobs, one
of which is call'd a single Bob, and the other a double. The
Rule for making the single Bob is this--When the whole hunt
leads, and the half hunt lies in thirds place, the next is a
Bob-change; in making of which, the whole hunt moves out of
the trebles place up into the seconds place hunting up, and
the bell which lies behind in the change next before the Bob,
makes a dodge with the bell in fourths place, and then lies
twice behind; and that bell which did dodge with the bell in
tenors place, moves directly down; this is a single Bob, that
is, one Bob-change. The Rule for making the double Bob is
this--When the whole hunt lies in the seconds place hunting
down, and the half hunt behind, then there is a double Bob,
that is, two Bob-changes, one of which is made the next
change wherein the whole Hunt moves out of the seconds place
down before the bells, and the other bob is made the next
change but one to it, in which the whole Hunt moves from
before the bells up into the seconds place; the bell which
lies in the thirds place when every Bob-change is made, lies
there twice, and then moves down. And at every double Bob,
the two hindmost bells continue dodging until the whole Hunt
moves up into the seconds place, and parts them. Every time
the whole Hunt comes before the bells, there is either a
single Bob, or double Bob made, which comes by turns, one
single, and the next double throughout the Peal.

The greatest variety of this Peal consists in making the
single changes. In this way of Ringing it (with any whole
Hunt and half Hunt) the first single change may be made
either at the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth
Bobs, at the single or double Bobs at pleasure; observing
for a constant Rule, that the half Hunt is alwayes one of
the two bells which makes every single change; for the single
changes are so contrived, that (in making them) the whole
Hunt and half Hunt are to continue their constant course as
at other times. At the single Bob, the single change is made
in seconds and thirds places; and at the double Bob, 'tis
made in fourth and fifths places, the other three bells lying
still in their places, whil'st each single change is made;
the next change to each single, is a Bob-change; every single
change is made when the whole hunt lies before the bells;
there being alwayes sixty changes, from the first single
change to the second; if the first single change is made at a
single bob, then the second single change must be made at the
third single bob from it; or if the first single change is
made at a double bob, the second single change must be made
at the third double bob from that where the first was made.

This Peal may be rang without making any single change
therein, which is done by making a double change to
supply the place of it. There are two of these double
changes in each Peal; the first of them may be made at
any bob within sixty changes from the beginning of the
Peal, and the second is to be made just sixty changes
from the first. At a double bob, it may be made at either
of the two bob-changes; at the first of them, 'tis made
by moving the whole Hunt down, and the bell in thirds place
up over two bells at once into the tenors place, thus:--

                                                             41325
                                                             14253

In making it at the second bob change of the double bob,
'tis the same as at the first, only in that the whole Hunt
moved down to lead; but in this it must move up from before
the bells into the seconds place, as in this change:--

                                                             12435
                                                             21354

The changes next following these, are the same as at other
times. At the single bob, 'tis to be made when the whole
Hunt lies in the seconds place hunting down; in which place
it may be made two wayes, in one of which the bell in thirds
place is to be moved up behind, in the same manner as I
showed you at the double bob: The other way, is to move
the bell in tenors place down into the thirds place, thus:--

                                                             51423
                                                             15342

Now the reason wherefore at this place it may be made two
wayes, and at each of the double bob changes but one way, is
this; At the double bob, the half Hunt lies behind, which
cannot be moved into thirds place, for that would put it out
of its course; but in the single bob, the half Hunt lying
before the bells, and the whole Hunt in seconds place, so
that neither of those bells are concerned therein; therefore
it may be made either by moving the bell in thirds place up
behind, or else by moving the hindmost bell down into thirds
place, both which are to one effect, though different changes;
for these changes are so continued, that (in making them)
the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to continue their constant
course, as at other times.

I have here set down this Peal of Grandsire, making the
treble the whole Hunt, and the tenor the half Hunt, and
the first single change is made the sixth bob; that is,
the third double bob, which is sixty changes from the
beginning of the Peal; you may know the single change, by
the line drawn between the figures at the single change,
that next after the line is the single: Grandsire is most
commonly rang, as it is here prickt; but it may be rang
any other way, according to my directions before.

Grandsire may be rang another way (i.e.) in making the
bobs when the whole Hunt is before the bells (as in the
former way) and to make the single changes when it lies
behind (viz.) the first single change may be made at any
time when the whole Hunt comes behind, provided it be made
within sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal; if
it is made the next time the whole Hunt comes behind after
a single bob, it is in treble and seconds places; after
a double bob, it is made in third and fourths places, the
whole Hunt lying behind when each single change is made, and
the second single change must be made just sixty changes from
the first.

In all the several Peals of Grandsire by the course
aforesaid, the first changes in each Peal must be made by
these following Rules:


  With these ten Hunts, the whole Hunt is to be hunted up
  at the beginning of each Peal.

    B 1,3
    B 1,5
      2,3
      2,4
      3,2
      3,5
      4,1
      4,5
      5,1
      5,4


  With these ten Hunts, the first change in each Peal is
  made by hunting the whole Hunt down.

      1,2
      1,4
      2,1
    B 2,5
      3,1
      3,4
      4,2
      4,3
      5,2
      5,3

These are the twenty Hunts on five bells, which are set
down in Page 26. The two figures which stand together, do
represent the whole Hunt and half Hunt; for instance, the
uppermost figures are 1,3; the 1 is the whole Hunt, and the
3 is the half Hunt, and so of the rest. Where the letter
B stands by the Hunt, the first change that Hunt makes is
a Bob: But with all the other Hunts, the first change is
either between the four first, or four last bells; yet the
first change in many of them may be made single, as in 1,2:
1,3: 1,4: 1,5: 2,1: 2,3: 3,1: 3,5: 4,1: 4,3: 1,5: 5,1: 5,4:

In hunting the treble down, the first change is made
between the four hindmost bells; and in hunting the
fifth bell up, the first change is made between the four
foremost bells.

There is another way to Ring this Peal of Grandsire, which
is, to make the bobs and single changes when the whole hunt
lies behind the bells; but this is not convenient to be
practised, therefore I will say no more of it in this place,
having only mentioned this, to shew the great variety there
is in this Peal.

This Peal of Grandsire is to be Rang by another course,
viz. to make the bobs when the whole hunt is behind
the bells, and the single changes, when it lies before
them. This is the absolute foundation from whence the
excellent Peal of Grandsire bob (on six bells) had its
beginning and method, and by practising to prick down
this Peal, and by observing the true course and method
of the bobs and single changes herein, you may with the
greatest ease understand the true course of the bobs and
single changes in Grandsire bob on six bells, for the half
hunt, the quarter hunt, and the three extream bells (in
Grandsire bob on six bells) do make these sixscore changes;
every time the whole hunt leads in Grandsire bob, there are
two changes made in this Peal of Grandsire on five bells:
And so consequently, the single changes in Grandsire bob
are made by the same rule and method as they are in this
Peal. The Rule for making the bobs in this Peal, is this
(viz.) when the whole hunt lies in the fourths place hunting
up, and the half hunt leads, the next is a double Bob: And
when the whole hunt lies in the tenors place, and the half
hunt in thirds place, then the next change is a single bob,
the bobs are made between the two first and two last bells,
that in thirds place lies still in the bob change, and then
moves up. The single changes are made when the whole hunt
leads; the first single change (in Ringing it with any whole
hunt and half hunt) may be made at any time when the whole
hunt leads, within sixty changes from the beginning of the
Peal, accounting the bells as they stand round at the beginning
 for one of the sixty changes. The single change that is made
the next time the whole hunt leads after a single bob, is
made in fourth and fifths places; and that which is made next
after a double bob, is made in second and thirds places, the
half hunt is alwayes one of the two bells which makes every
single change. If the first single change is made after a
single bob, then the second single change must be made when
the whole hunt leads next after the third single bob from
that after which the first single was made; and the same is
observed, in making them after a double bob: there being
alwayes sixty changes from the first to the second single
change in each Peal. This Peal I have here set down, in
which I make the treble the whole hunt, the fifth the half
hunt, and the first single change is made when the whole hunt
comes to lead next after the first single bob: You may know
the single change, by the line drawn between the figures;
the change next below the line, is the single, as in the
following Peal.

This Peal may be Rang without making any single change
therein, there are two double changes which may be made to
supply the places of the two single changes; the first of
these double changes in any Peal may be made any time when
the whole hunt lies in fourths place hunting up, provided
you make it within sixty changes from the beginning of the
Peal. At a double bob, it may be made at either of the two
bob changes, by moving the bell which lies in thirds place
down under two bells at once into the trebles place: Now
suppose it were to be made the first time the whole hunt
lies in the fourths place hunting up in the Peal next before,
which is at a double bob, the bells lie thus, 53412; now the
treble being the whole hunt must move up behind, and the
fourth bell being in thirds place, must move down under two
bells at once into the trebles place, thus, 45321; or else it
may be made at the next bob change of the double bob, 53241;
here the treble must be moved down into fourths place, and
the second bell into trebles place, thus, 25314. It may also
be made the change next before the single bob, in which
change it may be made two wayes; viz. either by moving the
bell in thirds place down into trebles place, as in the
changes next before, or else by moving the bell in trebles
place up into thirds place; for instance, two changes before
the first single bob (as in the Peal before set down) the
bells be thus, 24315; now the change may be made, either by
moving the third bell into the trebles place, thus, 32451; or
else the bell that leads up into thirds place, thus, 43251;
in both which wayes, the whole hunt is to be moved up behind.

There are only two of these double changes to be made in
each Peal: if the first is made at a double bob, then the
second must be made at the third double bob from it; or if
the first of them is made at a single bob, then the second
must be made at the third single bob from that where the
first was made, there being alwayes just sixty changes from
the first of these double changes to the second in each Peal.

These double changes are the same which in Grandsire bob
on six bells, are called true changes; those true changes
in Grandsire bob being made by the same rule, and in the
same manner as these are.

In all the Peals of Grandsire, wherein the bobs are made
when the whole hunt is behind (according to the Rules next
before set down) the first changes in each Peal must be
made by these Rules following.


  With these ten Hunts, the first change in each Peal is
  made by hunting down the whole Hunt.

      1,2
      1,5
      2,1
      2,5
      3,1
      3,4
      4,2
      4,3
    B 5,1
    B 5,3


  With these ten Hunts, the first change in each Peal is
  made by hunting the whole Hunt up.

      1,3
      1,4
      2,3
      2,4

    B 4,1
      4,5
      5,4
      5,2

Where the letter B stands next to any hunt; the first
change which that hunt makes, is a bob: But with all the
other hunts, the first change in each Peal is made double,
either between the four first, or four last bells; yet in
many of them, the first change may be made single, as in
1,2: 1,5: 2,1: 2,3: 2,5: 3,5: 4,3: 4,5: 5,2: 5,3:

Before I conclude my directions to this excellent Peal of
Grandsire, I will set down one general Rule for making the
single changes in any Peal (at places differing from any
of the former Rules) viz. wheresoever the whole hunt and
half hunt meets together to make a change (which constantly
happens every time the whole hunt hunts up, and every time it
hunts down in every Peal) the other three bells may lie still
in their places, whil'st the whole hunt and half hunt makes
the change; which being made, the whole hunt, the half hunt,
and the other bells are immediately to proceed in their
course; which single change is as effectual, as those which
are made by the Rules aforesaid. Observing to make the first
single change in any Peal, within sixty changes from the
beginning; and the second single change must be made (just
sixty changes from the first) between the whole hunt, and
half hunt, which two bells will in course lie in the same
places where the first single change was made.




The Seven-score and four on six Bells.


This Peal containing Seven-score and four changes, is to
be Rang on six bells, in which, the treble and tenor are
both whole hunts, and the second is half hunt; the whole
hunts do both hunt at one and the same time in a direct
course, one up, and the other down; and alwayes when one
of them lies before the bells, the other lies behind them;
and when that hunt which lies before the bells, leaves the
trebles place hunting up, the other hunt lying behind, leaves
the tenors place hunting down; each hunt lies only twice
together before the bells, and twice behind throughout the
Peal.

The second bell is the half hunt in this following Peal, for
the second, third, fourth and fifth bells make the twenty four
changes herein; every time the whole hunts come before and
behind the bells, there is one change made in the Twenty-four
(which is alwayes once in six changes) the second bell being
the hunt on the Twenty-four; so that every time it comes
before or behind the extream bells, there is an extream change
to be made, which in the following Peal is made between the
two farthest extream bells from the second. I have only set
down part of this Peal, which is sufficient to shew the course
and method thereof.

At the extream change next before, I have drawn a line
between the figures, that next below the line is the
extream: The aforesaid Peal may be Rang with any other
whole hunt, or half hunt; and also the Twenty-four changes
doubles and singles, may be made in the room of the plain
Twenty-four in the aforesaid Peal.




Trebles and Doubles on six Bells.


There are many Peals of Trebles and Doubles to be Rang on
six bells, as, Six-score changes, Seven-score and four,
Twelve-score, and Seven-hundred and twenty. In each of
which Peals, the changes that are made from the time that
the whole hunt leaves the trebles place hunting up, until
it comes down into that place again, are all made in one
and the same manner, so that the only difference in these
Peals, consists in making the changes when the whole hunt
leads. These Peals are called Trebles and Doubles, because
one is a treble change (that is, 3 changes made together,
in which all the six bells do change their places, thus,
123456:214365:) and the next is a double change between the
4 bells, in the midst, thus, 241635: And in this course the
changes are alwayes made from the time that the whole hunt
leaves the trebles place hunting up, until it comes down
into the trebles place again; and in Ringing this Peal,
'tis observed, that every bell does hunt in a perfect and
direct course, and be twice together before, and twice behind,
until the whole hunt leads.

The manner of Ringing the Seven-score and four, is this;
the treble and tenor are both whole hunts, and the second
is the half hunt; the first change is a treble change, and
the next a double change, as I shewed you before; in which
course they are made, until the treble leads again, and the
tenor lie behind; at which time there's a single change to
be made in third and fourths places: But when the half hunt
lies next to the treble, then the next single change must
be made in fourths and fifths places, as in this following
Peal, where I have only set down part of it for an example.

This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four changes doubles
and singles, the second, third, fourth and fifth makes the
Twenty-four changes; the second bell is the hunt in the
Twenty-four, therefore the extream in the Peal next before,
is made between the two farthest extream bells from it when
it lies before them: At the extream changes there's a line
drawn between the figures, but the extreams may be made every
time the second lies behind the extream bells; or else, every
time it lies before and behind them, in the same manner, as I
told you before in my directions to the Twenty-four Doubles
and Singles: And this Peal may be also Rang with any other
whole hunts, or half hunts.

In the Six-score Trebles and Doubles, the changes are the
same as in the Peal next before, until the whole hunt leads,
at which time (in this Peal) there is a double change to be
made between the four hindmost bells; but when the whole hunt
leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, then there is a
single change to be made, either between the two nearest
bells to the half hunt, or else between the two farthest
bells from it; there are but two single changes in the Peal,
and the second single change must be made between those two
bells which made the first. In this following, the treble is
the whole hunt, and the second the half hunt, and the first
single change is made when the bells do lie 124365: which is
sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal; after the whole
hunt has at first hunted up and down again: I have set down
only those changes which are made every time the whole hunt
leads.

The course of the Twelve-score, and the Seven-hundred and
twenty, are both one and the same; for the Twelve-score
changes, are only part of the Seven-hundred and twenty.
There's a whole hunt, a half hunt, a quarter hunt, and
three extream bells in the Seven-hundred and twenty; the
changes are all treble and double (in the same course, as
in the Six-score next before set down) until the whole hunt
leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, at which time
there's a single change to be made in fourth and fifths
places: But when the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt
lies next to it, and the quarter hunt lies next to the half
hunt, then there's an extream to be made, which is a single
change, and made between the two farthest extream bells from
the quarter hunt; and by observing this course, you may prick
down, or Ring the Seven-hundred and twenty: But if you would
only Ring Twelve-score changes (and then end there, by bringing
the bells round) you must make no extream change at all; for
in making every single change in fourth and fifths places,
the bells will come round in course at the end of Twelve-score
changes if you make no extream change to carry the Peal
forward. In the following changes, the treble is the whole
hunt, the 2 is the half hunt, the 3 the quarter hunt, and the
4, 5, and 6, are the extream bells. It being not much material
to set down this Peal at large, therefore after the treble
(which is the whole hunt) has hunted twice up and down, I
have put down only the two changes which are made every time
the treble leads to the end of the Twelve-score, as follows.

The last change is 123456: which is at the end of
Twelve-score changes; and here you see, that the whole
hunt, the half hunt, and quarter hunt, do lie next to
each other before the extream bells; therefore the bells
may either be brought round, by making the single change
in the same place, as those next before, are made thus,
123456: or else, if you would proceed forward to the end
of the Seven-hundred and twenty, then the next must be an
extream change between the fourth and sixth, which are the
2 hindmost bells, thus, 123564: and by observing to make an
extream change behind every time the 1, 2, 3, lie together
before the bells, the bells will come round in course at the
end of the Seven-hundred and twenty; at the end of every
Three score changes, there's a single change throughout the
Peal, and an extream change at the end of every Twelve-score.
This Peal (by the Rules aforesaid) may be Rang with any whole
hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt.

In this Peal is contained the Six-score changes of Old
Doubles on five bells, and also the Twenty-four changes
Doubles and Singles on four bells; the half hunt, the quarter
hunt, and three extream bells, makes the Six-score changes of
Old Doubles in a perfect course; and the quarter hunt, and
three extream bells, do make the Twenty-four changes Doubles
and Singles. Every time the whole hunt leads, there are made
two changes of the Six-score; and every time the whole hunt
leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, there are two
changes mades in the Twenty-four.




_Grandsire Bob_. On six Bells.


In this Peal of Grandsire Bob, there are Seven-hundred
and twenty changes, in Ringing of which, there is the
same course, as in Trebles and Doubles (before set down)
until the bob-changes come to be made; this Peal may more
properly be called Trebles and Doubles than the former,
because all the changes throughout the Seven-hundred
and twenty, are treble and double, except only the two
single changes: But in Ringing an Eighteen-score (which
is half the Seven-hundred and twenty, and a complete
Peal of it self) the changes are all treble and double
without any single change therein; for you must know,
that in any Peal of Grandsire bob, the bells will come
round in course at the end of Eighteen-score changes,
if you make no single change to carry it on farther to
the end of the Seven-hundred and twenty.

This Peal has a whole hunt, a half hunt, a quarter hunt, and
three extream bells; every bell hunts in a direct course, and
lies twice together before, and twice behind, until the whole
hunt leads, and then the four hindmost bells do dodge, that is,
they make a double change; in which 'tis alwayes observed,
that the two bells which lie in third and fifths places (in
the change next before the dodge) are hunting down, and in
making this double change, each of those bells do dodge with
the bell next above it, that is, they move up over one bell,
and then each of them moves directly down; and the two bells
that lie in fourth and tenors places in the change next
before every dodge, are hunting up, and in making the dodge
change, each of those bells do move down under one bell, and
then they move up again in their course, as before; the dodge
changes in all Peals of Trebles and Doubles, are made in the
same manner as these.

There are two sorts of bobs in this Peal, viz. a single,
and a double Bob; the Rule for making the single bob, is
this, when the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies
in tenors place, and the quarter hunt in fourths place,
the next change is a bob; and when the whole hunt leads,
and the half hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter
hunt in seconds place, then there is a double bob, that
is, two bob-changes; one of which is made the next change,
and the other is made the next time the whole hunt leads
after. The bobs are all double changes, and made in one
and the same manner (i.e.) the leading bell, and that in
fourths place, do both lie still, whil'st the two bells in
second and thirds places, and those in fifth and tenors
places make the bob-change; and as soon as 'tis made,
the bell in fourths place moves directly down. The half
hunt is alwayes one of the two hindmost bells which makes
every bob-change.

In Ringing this Peal, there is a Rule observed, whereby
the person that does Ring the quarter hunt, may give
notice of the bobs before they come to be made, without
which it were impossible to Ring it; the Rule is this:
In the dodge which is made between the four hindmost
bells every time the whole hunt leads, if the half hunt
and quarter hunt do dodge in fifth and tenors place, then
the next time the whole hunt leads, there's a single bob;
if they dodge in fourth and thirds places, then there's
a double bob that is, two bob-changes, one of which is
made the next time, the whole hunt leads after the dodge,
and the other is made the next time the whole hunt leads
after the former is made: He that does Ring the quarter
hunt, may give notice of every bob-change, by saying (Bob)
when the whole hunt is going to lead, which is a change
next before the bob is to be made.

There are certain Rules very convenient to be known by
all that practise to Ring this Peal; (viz.) he that does
Ring the whole hunt, must observe that the bell which he
first follows when he leaves the trebles place hunting up,
he must follow the same bell the next time he lies behind;
and the second bell which he follows in hunting up, he must
also follow the same bell when he next leaves the tenors
place hunting down; and likewise, the third bell which he
follows in hunting up, he must also follow the same bell when
he leaves the fifths place hunting down: For instance, in the
first change of the following Peal, the bells stand thus:
214365: here the treble (being the whole hunt) does first
follow the second, therefore when the treble has hunted up,
and lies behind, it follows the second again, as in this
change, 654321: And again, the second change of the following
Peal, is 241635: here the fourth is the second bell, which
the treble follows in hunting up, therefore he follows that
bell again the next time he leaves the tenors place hunting
down, as in this change, 563412: which course is observed
throughout the Peal. And in Ringing any other bell (beside
the whole Hunt) 'tis observed, that the next time you lie
before the bells after a bob, that bell which you first
follow in hunting up, you must also follow the same bell when
you lie behind; and the same bell you must first follow every
time you hunt up, and every time you lie behind, until the
next bob comes to be made, but if the whole hunt is the
second bell which you follow in hunting up, then you must
follow the whole Hunt when you lie behind; and the next time
you lead, and lie behind, you must follow the former bell as
before, until the bobs come to be made; and after the bobs,
the course is the same (though you do not follow the same
bell) as before.

These Rules and Directions before set down, are to be
observed in Ringing any Peal of Grandsire bob with any
whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt: An Example I
have here set down, wherein the treble is the whole Hunt,
the second the half Hunt, and the fourth the quarter Hunt,
as in these following changes.

Here are just Eighteen-Score changes already made, and
the bells may either be brought round in their places,
by making a dodg-change behind (according to the common
course), thus,

                                                            124365

but to have proceeded forward in the 720, the last should
have been a single change in third and fourths places, thus,

                                                            124365

the single change being made, all the following changes
to the end of the 720 are to be made, by the same rule and
course as those before set down, the last change of the
720 being also a single change, and to be made in the same
place, and between those two bells which made the former
single, thus,

                                                            124356
                                                            123456

which single change brings the bells round in their right
places at the end of the 720.

This Peal of Grandsire bob may be Rang with any whole
Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt; but there being some
difficulty in beginning many of the Peals, I have therefore
set down Directions for beginning each Peal, as follows.

    1.2.4
    1.2.5
    1.3.2
    2.3.6
    1.4.6
    1.5.3
    1.5.4
    1.6.3

    In Ringing Grandsire bob with any of these eight Hunts,
    the first changes in each Peal are to be made in the
    same manner, as those in the Peal before set down,
    until the first bob in each Peal comes to be made.

    1.2.3
    1.2.6
    1.3.5
    1.4.2
    1.4.5

    With these five Hunts, the first change in each Peal
    is a dodge between the four hindmost bells: thus,

                                                            123456
                                                            124365

Each three figures that stand together next before, do
represent a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and quarter Hunt:
for instance, the uppermost figures in the first Column,
are 1.2.4. there the treble is the whole Hunt, the second
the half Hunt, and the fourth the quarter Hunt, and so of
the rest.

In making the treble the whole Hunt, the fifth the half
Hunt, and the sixth the quarter Hunt; the first change
is a dodge between the four hindmost bells, in which the
half and quarter Hunt do dodge together in fifth and tenors
places, therefore the next time the whole hunt comes before
the bells, there's a single bob.

In ringing treble, tenor, and fifth, the whole Hunt moves
up the first change, thus 214365, and so on in the common
course until it comes next before the bells, at which time
there's a single bob.

In ringing treble, fourth, and third, the whole Hunt moves
up the first change, thus, 214365, and so forward in the
common course, until it leads again; at which time there's
a bob-change to be made, and another the next time the whole
Hunt leads after that, it being a double bob.

In ringing treble, third, and fourth, the first is a
dodge-change between the four hindmost bells, in which the
half Hunt and quarter Hunt do dodge together in third and
fourths places, therefore a double bob is next to be made,
one of which bob-changes is the next time the whole Hunt
leads, and the other the next following. In ringing treble,
fifth, and second, the first is a bob-change; and the next
time the whole Hunt leads, there's another bob-change, it
being a double bob.

In Ringing treble, sixth, and second, and treble, sixth,
and fourth, the first change in each of these two Peals
is a bob.

    2.4.6
    5.3.4
    6.1.2
    5.3.1

    With these four Hunts, the first change is treble,
    and the next double, thus, 214365, and so on, till
    the whole Hunt leads.

    3.5.2
    4.6.2
    6.2.1
    2.3.5
    6.3.5

    With these five Hunts, the first change must be made
    between the four bells in the midst, thus, 132546.

In Ringing tenor, treble, and second, there's a single
bob the first time the whole Hunt comes before the bells.

In all Peals of Grandsire bob, where the first change is
either a bob, or a dodge between the four hindmost bells,
or else a double change between the four bells in the midst,
it must be made at the back-stroke of the bells, otherwise
the Peal would cut compass all the way, that is, every bell
would come to lead at the back-stroke.

In the Eighteen-score changes before set down, there's a
line drawn between the figures at every bob, the changes
next below each line is a bob-change.

In the Seven-hundred and twenty changes of Grandsire bob,
there are two single changes to be made. The first single
change in any Peal is most commonly made as near the end of
Eighteen-score changes (from the beginning) as may be, and
'tis the best way, and most convenient: For instance, sometimes
it happens that one or more of those persons who do Ring this
Peal, may be weary before they have Rang Eighteen-score changes,
therefore upon notice given, the single change may be forborn,
and then the bells will in course come round at the end of
Eighteen-score changes, making a complete Peal; but after the
first single change is made, the bells cannot be brought
round in course, until the Seven-hundred and twenty are all
made.

There is great variety in making the single changes in
each Peal, which may be made at divers places (viz.)

The first single change in any Peal may be made the second
time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the
first or second double bobs, at which places the whole Hunt,
half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, do alwayes lie together before
the bells, and the single change is to be made in third and
fourths places.

The first single change in any Peal may also be made the
second time the whole Hunt leads after the first or second
single bobs, at which place the whole Hunt and half Hunt
do alwayes lie together before the bells; and the quarter
Hunt lies behind, therefore it must be made between the
two hindmost bells.

Or if the first bob in any Peal is a double bob, then
the first single change may be made the second time the
whole Hunt leads after the third double bob in that Peal,
at which place the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt
do lie together before the bells, and the single is made
in third and fourths places.

Or if the first bob in any Peal is a single bob, then the
first single change may be made the second time the whole
Hunt leads after the third single bob, where the whole Hunt
and half Hunt do alwayes lie together before the bells,
and the quarter Hunt behind, therefore the single change
must be made behind.

The first single change in any Peal may also be made either
at the first, second, or third single bobs, at which places
the whole Hunt leads, the half Hunt lies in tenors place,
and the quarter Hunt in fourths place, therefore it must
be made behind.

The first single change in any Peal may also be made the
next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of
the first or second double bobs, at which place the whole
Hunt, and quarter Hunt do alwayes lie together before the
bells, and the half Hunt in fourths place, therefore the
single change must be made in third and fourths places.
And in most Peals, the first single change may be made the
next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of
the third double bob; and in some Peals, the first single
change may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after
the third double bob (nothwithstanding the first bob-change
in that Peal is a single bob, as in the Eighteen-score treble,
second and fourth before set down) which falls out according
as the first bob change happens to be made either nearer the
beginning of the Peal, or farther from it; for in some Peals,
the bells will come round in course the next time the whole
Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the third double bob.
And in many Peals, the bells will come round at the fore-stroke
the second time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change
of the third double bob, &c.

There are two single changes in every Seven-hundred and
twenty, which are alwayes made when the whole Hunt leads,
the last single change in every Peal being constantly made
just Eighteen-score changes from the first; for making of
which, observe these Rules.

If the first single change (in any Peal) is made the
second time the whole Hunt leads after a double bob, then
the second single change must be made the second time the
whole Hunt leads after the third double bob, accounting
from the place where the first single change was made.

If the first single change in any Peal is made the second
time the whole Hunt leads after a single bob, then the second
single change must be made the second time the whole Hunt
leads after the third single bob, accounting from the place
where the first single change was made. Or if the first single
change is made at a single bob, then the second single change
must be made at the third single bob, accounting from the
place where the first single change was made.

The second single change in every Peal must be made between
those two bells, and in the same place where the first single
change was made; and the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter
Hunt, will in course lie in the same places at the second
single change, where they lay at the first: either the half
Hunt, or quarter Hunt, are alwayes one of the two bells which
makes every single change. But there are many other wayes to
make the single changes, viz. to make them between the half
Hunt, and quarter Hunt, at any dodge, where those two bells
do dodge together next before a bob, &c. of which I need not
say any thing more in this place, having already set down
all those wayes which are most easie and convenient to be
practised.

In Ringing this Peal of Grandsire bob, (with any whole
Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt) if there's no single
change made within Eighteen-score changes from the
beginning of the Peal, the bells will in course come round
in their right places, just at the end of Eighteen-score
changes.

In any Peal of Grandsire bob, where the first is a double
change, and made at the back-stroke, the last change of the
Peal (which brings the bells round in their right places)
is a treble change, and made at the fore-stroke.

The Seven-hundred and twenty changes of Grandsire Bob may
be Rang without making any single change therein, which way
of Ringing it, is call'd _Grandsire Bob True_: that is,
the changes are all true trebles and doubles without any
single change therein. There are made two double changes
(contrary to the course of all the double changes in the
Peal) to supply the place of the two single changes, which
two are called True changes; and to be made divers wayes,
and at several places. The first true change in any Peal may
be made at the first, second, or third double bobs either
at the first or second bob-change of each. At the first
bob-change of any double bob it may be made, by moving the
Bell in fourths place down under two Bells at once into the
seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells must make a change
at the same time: for Example, in the Eighteen-score of
treble, second and fourth before set down, at the first
bob-change of the first double Bob, the Bells stand thus,
143526. Now the true change is made, by moving the Bell which
lies in fourths place down under two Bells at once into
seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells are at the same
time to make a change thus, 154362. At this place it may be
made another way, by moving the hindmost Bell down under two
Bells at once into the fourths place, and the two Bells in
second and thirds places are at the same time to make a
change thus, 134652. At the last Bob-change of each double
Bob, it may also be made two wayes; one of which, is to move
the Bell in fourths down into the seconds place, and the two
hindmost Bells at the same time to make a change, as I shewed
you before: But the best and easiest way is to move the bell
which lies in fourths place up over two bells at once into
the tenors place, and the two bells in second and thirds
places to make a change as at a bob: for instance, at the
last bob-change of the first double bob in the Eighteen-score
before set down, the figures stand thus, 143652. Now the bell
in fourths place must be moved up behind, and the two bells
in second and thirds places are to make a change, 134526. The
second True change in every Peal must be made just Eighteen-score
changes from the first, in making of which, these Rules are to
be observed. If the first true change in any Peal is made at the
first bob-change of a double bob, then the second true change
must be made at the first bob-change of the third double bob,
accounting from the place where the first true change is
made, but not reckoning that for one of the three: or if the
first true change is made at the last bob-change of a double
bob, then the second true change must be made at the last
bob-change of the third double bob, accounting from the place
where the first true change was made, but not reckoning that
for one of the three. And the second true change in every
Peal must be made in the same manner and place as the first,
the true and single changes in Grandsire bob, are both to one
and the same effect (i.e.) to alter the course of the extream
bells; for in making these changes, the whole hunt, half
hunt, and quarter hunt are to continue their constant course
without variation, neither of those 3 bells being any otherwise
concerned therein, than at the change which should have been
made, if the single or true change had been forborn.

There is another way to Ring this Peal of Grandsire Bob,
by a course differing from the former. When the whole Hunt
leads, the half Hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter
Hunt in fourths place, then the next change is a single bob;
and when the whole Hunt leads, and the half Hunt lies in
fifths place, and the quarter Hunt in thirds place, then the
next change is the first bob-change of a double bob; the bobs
and dodge-changes herein are made in the same manner, as
those in the former way: But the bobs herein are called by a
Rule differing from the former, viz. when the whole Hunt and
half Hunt do lie together before the bells, and the quarter
Hunt (lying in fourths place) dodges with the bell in thirds
place, then the second time the whole Hunt comes before the
bells (from that place) there is made the first bob-change of
a double bob, the second bob-change being made the next time
the whole Hunt leads after. When the whole Hunt and half
Hunt, do lie together before the bells, and the quarter Hunt
(lying in fifths place) dodges with the bell in tenors place,
then the second time the whole Hunt leads (from that place)
is made a single bob.

There are two single changes in the Seven-hundred and
twenty, the first single change in any Peal may be made at
the first, second, or third single bobs, at which places
it must be made between the 2 hindmost bells; or the first
single change may be made the next time the whole Hunt leads
after the first, second, or third single bobs, at which
places 'tis alwayes made between the two hindmost bells. The
first single change may also be made the next time the whole
Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the first, second, or
third double bobs, where it must alwayes be made in third and
fourths places. But in some few Peals it happens, that the
bells will come round at the fore-stroke the next time the
whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, and also after
the last bob-change of the third double bob, which falls out
according as the first bob-change in each Peal is made,
either nearer the beginning, or farther off.

The second single change (in every Peal) must be made
Eighteen-score changes from the first, in making of which,
these Rules must be observed.

If the first single change is made at a single bob, then
the second single change must be made at the third single
bob from the place where the first was made. Or if the first
single change is made the next time the whole Hunt leads
after a single bob, then the second single change must be
made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the third
single bob, accounting from the place where the first single
change was made. And the same Rule is observed in making it
after a double bob.

The second single change in every Peal must be made in
the same place, and between those two bells which made
the first single change: But (in Ringing this Peal) if
you make no single change, the bells will in course come
round at the end of Eighteen-score changes.

The way to begin several of these Peals, is as follows.

In Ringing treble, third, and fifth; and second, third, and
fifth; and also third, fifth, and second; the first change
is treble, and the next double, and so forward in the common
course of trebles and doubles, until the first Bob in each
comes to be made. In treble, second and third, the first
changes are treble and double in the common course; and the
second time the treble leads, there's a double Bob. In treble,
tenor and second, the first changes are treble and double in
the common course; and the second time the treble leads,
there's a single Bob. In treble, second and fifth, the first
change is a dodge between the four hindmost Bells; and the
second time the treble leads, there's a single Bob. In second,
fourth and tenor, the first change is made between the 4
Bells in the midst. In treble, second and fourth, the first
change is a dodge behind; and the second time the treble
leads, there's a double Bob.




Changes on eight Bells.


There are 40320 several changes on 8 bells, which to Ring
it is altogether impossible; the greatest Peal that ever
was Rang on 8 Bells, is 1680, being only a third part of
the changes on seven Bells, which are to be Rang with a
whole Hunt, half Hunt, quarter Hunt, half quarter Hunt
(for so you may term it) and three extream Bells: But
the most complete and musical Peal that ever was Rang on
eight Bells, is Grandsire Bob, treble, second and fifth,
Half-pulls, on 1.2.3.5.6.7. the fourth and the tenor lying
behind every change, thus, 123567,48. which has of late
been practised by the _Colledge-Youths_, and excellently
well performed by them. Grandsire, and Tendring Six-score
on eight Bells makes good Musick, 7.4.8. lying behind every
change: And a Six-score (four extreams) on the six Bells in
the midst, the treble leading all the way, and the tenor
lying behind, making a change at first between the 4 and 5,
and then proceeds forwards in the Six-score, making the
second the whole Hunt, and the seventh the half Hunt, it
makes excellent Musick; but after the Six-score changes are
made, the fourth and fifth must change their places again to
bring the Bells round.

    35678,241
    12357,864
    12357,468
    12357,648
    12356,748
    34567,218
    45678,321
    12368,574

The most musical Peals that are commonly Rang on eight
Bells, are these Six-scores on five, the other three Bells
lying behind every change: For example, the uppermost fig.
are 35678,241. here the 35678, makes the Six-score changes,
3 the whole hunt, and 8 the half Hunt, or any others, and
241. strikes behind every change, in the same order as they
now lie, and so of the rest. The three Bells which are to
lie behind, must first be hunted up one after the other in
order, before any of the Six-score changes are made. The
Seven-score and four on the six middle Bells, the treble
leading, and the tenor lying behind every change, makes
good Musick.




Of Hanging Bells.


First, for the Stock, much need not be said, but of
placing the Cannons or Crown of the Bell into it, which
is called _Hanging of a Bell_, I shall speak something:
First, find out whether the Cannons be upright and true,
then raise the Bell up by some Rope tyed to the Cannons,
and so that the Bell hang level, which you may find, by
applying a Plumet to the brim, then fasten a string to the
Crown-staple within the Bell, then (a Plumet being tyed
to the other end of the string) if the string hang in the
midst between the two sides of the Bell whereon the Clapper
should strike, the Crown-staple is cast into the Bell true:
Now when you have hung the Bell, and let the Gudgeons in true
by Keys (for therein consists the main point of the going of
a Bell) then if the Clapper hang in the midst between the two
striking sides, and the Stock stand upright, the Bell is well
hung.

If a Bell have a longer stroke on the one side, than
the other, truss up that side which hath the short stroke
more, or let the other side down, and put a piece or two
of Leather in, according to the stroke; but sometimes the
fault of the stroke is in the Sally, which you may remedy,
by tying the Fillet (or little Cord about the rim of the
Wheel, which causeth the dancing of the Rope) nearer, or
farther off the main Spoke; nearer makes a short stroke,
farther off the Spoke, a long one.

And observe, that the trussing or taking up of a great Bell
far into the Stock by a notch, makes the Bell go easier,
and lie lighter at hand (that is) when it is set, for the
farther the brim of the Bell is from the centre of gravity,
the heavier it is: Now the centre of gravity is a supposed
line drawn through the Stock from one Gudgeon to the other;
but note, if you truss a Bell up, that the Crown-staple
be much above the Gudgeons, you must fasten a false Eye to
the Crown-staple, and to this false Eye hang the Clapper,
otherwise it will not strike so freely: Now small Bells
must be trussed up short, for else the Bell hanging low,
and fetching a great Compass in the swing, and having but
little Compass in the brim, the Clapper keeps along by the
side of the Bell, and gives no blow at all; but being hung
short, the Bell fetches a quick and short Compass, equal
to the bigness of the brim, and the Clapper strikes well.

Now for the tempering of the Gudgeons, I leave it to the
judgment of the Workman; but a word or two of the polishing
of it. After it is filed, or turned exactly round, take
two pieces of Oak, and oyl one side of each, and strew fine
Sand thereon, and clap them in a Smiths Vice, with the round
of the Gudgeon between, then turn it about, until you think
it is sufficiently polished, then oyl the sides of the pieces
of Oak wherein there is no Sand, and so clap them in a Vice,
with the Gudgeon between, as before, then turn it round, and
it will polish the Gudgeon wonderful smooth; and if the
Brasses are likewise well polished, the Bell will go as
well at the first, as ever: Now by the neglect of this, the
roughness of the Gudgeon will wear the Brasses so unequally,
that the Bell will never go smooth and steddy.

Now I would advise all Bell hangers to hang Bells with
bolts of Iron to come from the Cannons through the Stock,
and to fasten them with Keys at the top of the Stock, and
not with plates nailed on the sides; for they are mighty
inconvenient to fasten a bell that is loose in the Stock,
or to alter the stroke.

As for the Rowle, let it not be without, nor within the
hollow of the side of the Wheel; nor above, nor below the
hollow at the bottom of the Wheel. Now the bigger a Wheel
is, if the Frame will permit, the bell will go the better;
when the wheel is new, nail Stays from the Stock to each
Spoke, to keep it from warping.

'Tis very convenient (if the Frame will permit) to fasten a
piece of Timber about half a foot long on the end of the
main Spoke at the top of the Wheel (whereon the end of the
bell-rope is fastned) with a notch on the end of it; so at
the setting of the bell, the Rope will hit into that notch
from the Rowle, and this will make the bell lie easier at
hand when it is set, and flie better.




FINIS.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
