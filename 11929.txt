WAGES IN 17TH AND 19TH CENTURIES.

Running my eye accidentally through the household book of Sir Roger
Twysden, from 1659 to 1670, it occurred to me to make a comparison
between the relative prices of meat and wages, as there given, in
order to ascertain the position of our peasantry in these parts, at
the close of the 17th century. I send you a few extracts, by which
it will be seen that, in Kent, at least, our agricultural labourers
appear to have been in far better condition than those of the rest
of England, who, in Mr. Macaulay's brilliant work, are represented
as living "almost entirely on rye, barley, and oats," owing to the
exorbitantly high price of meat, as compared with the ordinary scale
of wages.

As to meat, I find the following entries:--

   "1659. Beef
          2s. and 1s. 8d. per stone.
          a loin of mutton                    1s. 6d.
    1662. Beef                         2s. per stone.
          a shin of beef                     1s. 10d.
          a loin of veal                      3s. 4d.
          a calve's head                      1s. 2d.
          a quarter of mutton         4s. 4d. and 5s.
          a side of mutton                        9s.
    1664. 8 quarters of mutton                   32s.
          1 quarter of do.                        4s.
          6 stone of beef                    10s. 4d.
    1666. 6 stone of beef                    10s. 4d.
          a fat weather                      12s. 8d.
          32 fat weathers                        19l.
    1667. 10 stone of beef and 2 lb. of suet     18s.
          22 stone of beef                        2l.
          23 stone of beef                    2l. 3s.
          a chine and a quarter of veal           8s.
    1670. A chine and a quarter of mutton         5s.
          a quarter of lamb                   2s. 6d."

Through this period we have:--

   "Cheese per load, _i.e._ 56 lb., at 14s., 11s., 10s., 4d.,
    9s. 6d."

The wages of labourers through the same period are entered:--

   "Sawyer                              2s. 6d. per hundred.
    a farm carpenter                        1s. 6d. per day.
      or, 'I finding him,'                      1s. per day.
    common labourers, generally 1s. per    \
      day; sometimes, but less frequently,  >   in 1849, 2s.
      9d. per day                          /
    threshing wheat, 16d. per quarter           in 1849, 3s.
    mowing, from 1s. to 1s. 8d. per acre    in 1849, 3s. 6d.
    mowing oats, 1s. 3d. per acre           in 1849, 2s. 6d.
    mowing clover, 1s. 6d. per acre         in 1849, 2s. 6d.
    hayers, 2s. and 2s. 6d. per week            in 1849, 6s.
    reaping, 2s. per acre              in 1849, 10s. to 14s.
    sheep shearing, 1s. per score           in 1849, 2s. 6d.
    hedging 2-1/2d. per rod                     in 1849, 4d.
    hoeing, 6d. per acre                        in 1849, 4s.
    women 8d. per day              in 1849, 1s., and 1s. 4d.
    boys, 4d. per day                   in 1849, 6d. and 3d.
    making faggots, 18d. and 20d. per hundred;  in 1849, 3s."

A reference to the household-books of the Derings, in East Kent,
gives the same results.

The wages given by Sir Roger Twysden to his household servants at
this time were:--

   "Housekeeper                                  5l. per annum.
    maids                                      2l. 10s. and 3l.
    men                                   5l. 10s., 5l. and 4l."

{226}I have added, in most instances, the prices now paid to
labourers in these parts, having obtained my information from the
farmers of the neighbourhood.

The price of butchers' meat at present, in this neighbourhood, is
from 6d. to 7 1/2d. per lb.; by wholesale, 3s. 6d. or 3s. 8d. per
stone.

As far, then, as the relative prices of wages and meat can guide us,
the labourer, in these parts, was as well able to purchase meat in
1670 as he is now.

Unhappily for him, the imprudence of early marriage entailing upon
him the charge of a family, he is precluded from the indulgence in
fresh meat, except as an occasional treat. Cheese and bacon,
however, are still within his reach. The improvidence of early
marriage rarely occurred in former days, and palpably, if our
Kentish labourers lived _entirely_ on oats and rye, it was not
of _necessity_ that they did so. I am inclined to think that,
in many of the instances given above, especially in haying and
harvest, provisions of some sort were found by the employer, over
and above the wages. When I have more leisure, I will endeavour to
obtain correct information on this point; and meanwhile, send you
the entries just as I find them. I observe an entry of "peas to boil
for the men." They had porridge then, at all events, in addition to
their wages; and these wages, if they had so chosen, could further
have purchased them meat, quite as well as at the present day;
though, alas for our poor peasantry, this is not saying much for
them; and even of that little smack of meat they will soon be
debarred, if the present system--but I am intruding on sacred
ground, and must leave the poor fellows to their hard work and
scanty meals.

MARLOWE AND THE OLD "TAMING OF A SHREW."

I regret that my communication (No. 13. p. 194.), on the subject of
the authorship of _The Taming of a Shrew_, was too late to be
of any avail for the already-published new edition of Marlowe's
works; and, had I been aware of such being the case, I should have
waited until I had had an opportunity of seeing a work whose editor
may entertain views in ignorance of which, to my disadvantage, I am
still writing. It is, perhaps, a still greater disadvantage that I
should appear to depend for proofs upon a bare enumeration of
parallel passages; when I know that the space I should require for
the purposes of stating the case fully and fairly, and, as I think,
conclusively, would be utterly inconsistent with that brevity which
must be with you an essential condition; while, at the same time, I
know of no medium through which I am so likely to enlist the
attention of a "fit audience" as your publication. Premising that my
references are to _The Taming of a Shrew_ in "Six Old Plays,"
1799, and to Marlowe's Works, edit. 1826, I proceed to indicate such
passages as a rapid glance through the respective works, aided by
some previous acquaintance with the subject, and a not very bad
memory, furnished. Some of the parallels will be found identical; in
others, the metaphors will be found to be the same, with the
expression more or less varied; and in others, again, particular
expressions are the same, though the tenor of the phrase be
different. It will be observed that the quotations of Marlowe are
exclusively from _Dr. Faustus_ and _Tamburlaine_. Of the
longer passages I have given merely the first line for reference;
and I have numbered them for the convenience of comparison:--

THE TAMING OF A SHREW.

(2) "But stay, what dames are these, so bright of hue," &c. p. 167.

       --_Faustus_, vol. ii. p.192.

       --_Tamb_. vol. i. p.154.

             --"the golden eye of heaven."
       --_Tamb_. vol. i. p.155.

       --_Tamb_. vol. i. p.177.

(5) "I'll have them fly to India for gold," &c.
       --_Faustus_, vol. ii. p. 123.

(6) "And show your pleasure to the Persian

       --_Tamb_. vol. i. p.87.
{226}

(7) "_Wagner_. Come hither, sirha! Boy!
     _Clown_. Boy! O disgrace to my person!" &c.
       --_Faustus_, vol. ii, p. 131.

Leaving the question in this position for the present, I shall be
glad of such information from any of your readers as may tend to
throw a light on the date of Shakspeare's _Taming of the
Shrew_. I find Mr. Collier's opinion expressed in the following
words:--

   "The great probability is that _Hamlet_ was written
    at the earliest in 1601, and the _Taming of the Shrew_
    perhaps came from the pen of its author not very long afterwards."

I am anxious to ascertain whether I am acquainted with all the
circumstances on which the above opinion is founded; as those which
I can, at this moment, recall, are to my mind hardly sufficiently
conclusive. Rejecting the supposed allusion to Heywood's _Woman
Kill'd with Kindness_, which I see, by a note, Mr. Collier gives
up as untenable ground, the facts, I believe, remain as follows:--

First: _The Taming of the Shrew_ was not mentioned by Meres in
1598, whereupon it is assumed that "had it been written, he could
scarcely have failed to mention it." And,

Second: it must have been written after _Hamlet_, because the
name Baptista, used incorrectly in that play as a feminine name, is
properly applied to a man in this. And these, I believe, are all.
Now, the first of these assumptions I answer, by asking, "Does it
follow?" Of all Shakspeare's plays which had then appeared, only
three had been published before 1598, and not one comedy. Meres, in
all probability, had no list to refer to, nor was he making one: he
simply adduced, in evidence of his assertion of Shakspeare's
excellence, both in tragedy and comedy, such plays of both kinds as
he _could_ recollect, or the best of those which he _did_
recollect. Let us put the case home; not in reference to any modern
dramatist (though Shakspeare in his own day was not the great
exception that he stands with us), but to the world-honoured poet
himself, who has founded a sort of religion in us: I, for my part,
would not be bound not to omit, in a hasty enumeration, and having
no books to refer to, more important works than the _Taming of the
Shrew_. In short, the omission by Meres proves no more than that
he either did not think of the play, or did not think it necessary
to mention it. To the second assumption, I answer that the date of
the _first Hamlet_ is "not proven:" it may have been an early
play. From the play of _Hamlet_, in its earlier form, is the
name Baptiste, where it is used in conjunction with Albertus, taken;
the scene mentioned is Guiana; and there is nothing to lead one to
suppose that the name is used as an Italian name at all. Both the
date of _Hamlet_, therefore, and--whichever way decided--the
conclusion drawn from the supposed mistake, I regard as open
questions. There is yet another circumstance which Mr. Collier
thinks may strengthen his conclusion with regard to the date of this
play. He refers to the production of Dekker's _Medicine for a
Curst Wife_, which he thinks was a revival of the old _Taming
of a Shrew_, brought out as a rival to Shakspeare's play. This is
easily answered. In the first place, Katharine, the Shrew, is not a
"curst wife:" she becomes a wife, it is true, in the course of the
play; but this is a part of the process of taming her. But what
seems at once to disprove it is, that, according to Henslow's
account, Dekker was paid 10_l_. 10_s_. for the piece in
question; as Mr. Collier observes, an "unusually large sum" for a
new piece, and not likely to be paid for the bashing up of an old
one. I am thus left entirely without a clue, derivable from external
evidence, to the date of this play; and shall be glad to know if
there is any thing, throwing light upon the point, which I may have
overlooked. That more important consequences are involved in this
question than appear upon the face of it, I think I shall be able to
show in a future communication; and this is my excuse for
trespassing so much upon your space and your readers' patience.

NOTES FROM FLY-LEAVES, NO. 6.

In a copy of Burnet's _Telluris Theoria Sacra_ (in Latin),
containing only the two first books (1 vol. 4to., Lond. 1689), there
is the following entry in Bishop Jebb's hand-writing:--

   "From the internal evidence, not only of additional matter
    in the margin of this copy, but of frequent erasures and
    substitutions, I was led to suppose it was the author's copy,
    illustrated by his own annotations and improvements. The
    supposition is, perhaps, sufficiently corroborated by the
    following extract from the _Biographia Britannica_,
    vol. iii. p. 18.

   "'It seems it was usual with Dr. Burnet, before he published
    any thing in Latin, to have two or three copies, and no more,
    printed off, which he kept by him for some time, in order to
    revise at leisure what he had written _currente calamo_,
    and sometimes, when he thought proper, to be communicated to
    his particular friends for their opinions, &c.'

   "This copy, as it does not differ from any of the editions of
    1689, was certainly not one of those _proofs_. But the
    Doctor's habit of annotating on his own Latin books after they
    were printed, renders it extremely probable that this book was
    a preparation for a new edition. It would be well to compare it
    with the English translation."

The nature of many of the corrections and additions (which are very
numerous), evidently shows a preparation for the press. I have
compared this copy with the English edition, published in the same
year, and find that some of the {228}corrections were adopted; this,
however, but in a few instances, while in one, to be mentioned
presently, a palpable mistake, corrected in the MS. Latin notes,
stands in the translation. The English version differs very
materially from the Latin. The author says in his Preface:--

 "This English version is the same in substance with the
  Latin, though I confess, 'tis not so properly a translation,
  as a new composition upon the same ground, there being
  several additional chapters in it, and several new moulded."

The following are examples of corrections being adopted: P. 6. Latin
ed. "Quod abunde probabitur in principio libri secundi." For the
last word _subsequentis_ is substituted, and the English has
_following_. P. 35. "Hippolitus" is added to the authorities in
the MS.; and in the English, p. 36., "Anastasius Sinaiti, S.
Gaudentius, Q. Julius Hilarius, Isidorus Hispalensis, and
Cassiodorus," are inserted after Lactantius, in both. P. 37.
"Johannes Damascenus" is added after St. Augustin in both. P. 180. a
clause is added which seems to have suggested the sentence
beginning, "Thus we have discharged our promise," &c. But, on the
other hand, in p. 8. the allusion to the "Orphics," which is struck
out in the Latin, is retained in the English; and in the latter
there is no notice taken of "Empedocles," which is inserted in the
margin of the Latin. In p. 11. "Ratio naturalis" is personified, and
governs the verb _vidit_, which is repeated several times. This
is changed by the corrector into vidimus; but in the English
passage, though varying much from the Latin, the personification is
retained. In p. 58., "Dion Cassius" is corrected to "Xiphilinus;"
but the mistake is preserved in the English version.

SHAKSPEARE'S EMPLOYMENT OF MONOSYLLABLES.

I offer the following flim-flam to the examination of your readers,
all of whom are, I presume, more or less, readers of Shakspeare, and
far better qualified than I am to "anatomize" his writings, and "see
what bred about his heart."

I start with the proposition that the language of passion is almost
invariably broken and abrupt, and the deduction that I wish to draw
from this proposition, and the passages that I am about to quote is,
that--_Shakspeare on more than one occasion advisedly used
monosyllables, and monosyllables only, when he wished to express
violent and overwhelming mental emotion_, ex. gratia:--


    _Lear._ "Thou know'st the first time that we smell the air,
  We wawl, and cry:--I will preach to thee; mark me.

    [_Gloster._ "Alack! alack the day!]

    _Lear._ "When we are born, we cry, that we are come
  To this great stage of fools,--This a good block?"
    --_King Lear_, Act IV. Sc. 6.

In this passage [I bracket Gloster] we find no fewer than
_forty-two monosyllables_ following each other consecutively.
Again,


   "------but through his lips do throng
    Weak words, so thick come, in his poor heart's aid,
    That no man could _distinguish_ what he said."
   _Rape of Lucreece_, Stanza 255.

After I had kept this among other flim-flams for more than a year in
my note-book, I submitted it in a letter to the examination of a
friend; his answer was as follows:--"Your canon is ingenious,
especially in the line taken from the sonnet. I doubt it however,
much, and rather believe that sound is often sympathetically, and as
it were unconsciously, adapted to sense. Moreover, monosyllables are
redundant in our tongue, as you will see in the scene you quote. In
_King John_, Act III. Sc. 3., where the King is _pausing_
in his wish to incense Hubert to Arthur's murder, he says:--

   'Good friend, though hast no cause to say so yet:
    But thou shall have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
    Yet it shall come, for me to do thee good.
    I had a thing to say,--But let it go:'--

forty monosyllables."


   "Credimus? an qui amant ipsi sibi somnia fingunt."

The very passage he quoted seemed, to my eyes, rather a
_corroboration_ of the theory, than an _argument against

ending with the words "Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill," and,
with the exception of three words, consisting _entirely_ of
monosyllables, and one or two other passages. But I have written
enough to express my meaning.

NOTES UPON CUNNINGHAM'S HAND-BOOK FOR LONDON.

_ Wild House, Drury Lane._--Mr. Cunningham says, "Why so
called, I am not aware." _Wild_ is a corruption of _Weld_.
It was the town mansion of the family of the _Welds_, of
Lutworth Castle.

_Compton Street, Soho._--Built in the reign of Charles the
First by Sir Francis Compton. _New_ Compton Street, when first
formed, was denominated Stiddolph Street, after Sir Richard
Stiddolph, the owner of the land. It afterwards changed its name,
from a demise of the whole adjoining marsh land, made by Charles the
Second to Sir Francis Compton. All this, and the intermediate
streets, formed part of the site of the Hospital of St. Giles.

_Tottenham Court Road._--The old manor-house, sometimes called
in ancient records "Totham Hall," was, in Henry the Third's reign,
the residence of William de Tottenhall. Part of the old buildings
were remaining in 1818.

{229}_Short's Gardens, Drury Lane_.--Dudley Short, Esq., had a
mansion here, with fine garden attached, in the reign of Charles the
Second.

_Parker Street, Drury Lane._--Phillip Parker, Esq., had a
mansion on this site in 1623.

_Bainbridge and Buckridge Streets, St. Giles's_.--The two
streets, now no more, but once celebrated in the "annals of low
life," were built prior to 1672, and derived their names from their
owners, eminent parishioners in the reign of Charles the Second.

_Dyot Street, St. Giles's._--This street was inhabited, as late
as 1803, by Philip Dyot, Esq., a descendant of the gentleman from
whom it takes its name. In 1710 there was a certain "Mendicant's
Convivial Club" held at the "Welch's Head" in this street. The
origin of this club dated as far back as 1660, when its meetings
were held at the Three Crowns in the Poultry.

_Denmark Street, St. Giles's._--Originally built in 1689.
Zoffany, the celebrated painter, lived at No. 9. in this street. The
same house is also the scene of Bunbury's caricature, "The Sunday
Evening Concert:"--

   "July 27. 1771.--Sir John Murray, late Secretary to the
    Pretender, was on Thursday night carried off by a party
    of strange men, from a house in _Denmark Street_, near
    St. Giles's church, where he had lived some time."

QUERIES.

FOLK LORE.

_Metrical Charms_.--In the enumeration of the various branches
of that interesting subject, the "FOLK LORE OF ENGLAND," on which
communications were invited in the last number of "NOTES AND
QUERIES," there is an omission which I beg to point out, as it
refers to a subject which, I believe, deserves especial
investigation, and would amply repay any trouble or attention that
might be bestowed upon it. I allude to _Metrical Charms_, many
of which are still preserved, and, in spite of the corruptions they
have undergone in the course of centuries, would furnish curious and
valuable illustrations of the Mythological System on which they are
founded.

   "Spirits of the flood and spirits of the hills found a
    place in the mythology of Saxon England,"

says an able reviewer of Mr. Kemble's _Saxons in England_, in
_The Anthenaeum_ (13th Jan. 1849); and he continues,


   "The spells by which they were invoked, and the forms
    by which their aid was compelled, linger, however, still
    amongst us, although their names and powers have passed
    into oblivion. In one of the Saxon spells which
    Mr. Kemble has inserted in the Appendix, we at once
    recognised a rhyme which we had heard an old woman
    in our childhood use,--and in which many Saxon words
    unintelligible to her were probably retained."

Who would not gladly recover this "old rhyme?"--I can say for
myself, that if these lines should ever meet the eye of the writer
of the passage I have quoted, I trust he will be induced to
communicate, in however fragmentary a shape, this curious addition
to our present scanty stories of mythological information.

While on the subject of _Charms and Spells_, I would ask those
who are more familiar than myself with the Manuscript treasures of
the British Museum, and of our University Libraries, whether they
have ever met with (except in MSS. of Chaucer) the remarkable "Night
Spell" which the Father of English Poetry has preserved in the
following passage of his _Miller's Tale_. I quote from Mr.
Wright's edition, printed for the Percy Society:--

   "'What Nicholas, what how man, loke adoun:
    Awake and think on Cristes passioun
    I crowche the from Elves and from Wightes.'
    There with the night-spel seyde he anon rightes
    On the foure halves of the hous aboute
    And on the threissh-fold of the dore withoute.

   "'Lord Jhesu Crist and seynte Benedight,
    Blesse this hous from every wikkede wight
    Fro nightes verray, the white Paternoster
    When wonestow now, seynte Petres soster.'"

This charm has long occupied my attention, and as I hope shortly to
submit to the Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries an attempt to
illustrate some parts of it which are at present certainly involved
in very great obscurity, I shall be glad to be informed whether any
other early version of it is to be found in MS., and if so, where;
and also whether any other version, corrupted or not, is still
preserved, if not in use, at least in memory. I should also be
especially glad of references of any other allusion to the "white
Paternoster" or "seynte Petres soster," or for any information as to
sources for ascertaining the history, whether authentic or
legendary, of the personage supposed to be alluded to in the closing
words of this remarkable spell.

ALLUSIONS IN THE HOMILIES.

_"A Good Wife," &c._, and _"God speed the Plough!"_--I
should hold myself deeply indebted to any of your correspondents who
would inform me where the two following quotations are to be found.

I have been anxiously looking for them for some years. I have taken
some pains myself--{230} "I have poached in Suidas for unlicensed
Greek"--have applied to my various antiquarian friends (many of
whose names I was delighted to recognise among the brilliant galaxy
that enlightened your first number)--but hitherto all in vain; and I
am reduced to acknowledge the truth of the old proberb, "A ---- may
ask more questions in an hour than a wise man can answer in seven
years:"--

  I. "For thus will most truly be verified the _saying of the
  poet_, 'A good wife, by obeying her husband, shall bear the
  rule, so that he shall have a delight and a gladness the sooner at
  all times to return home to her.' But, on the contrary part, 'when
  the wives be stubborn, froward, and malapert, their husbands are
  compelled thereby to abhor and flee from their own houses, even as
  they should have battle with their enemies.'"--_Homily on
  Matrimony_, p. 450. ed. Oxford, 1840.

Query--_Who_ is the _poet?_

  II. "Let no good and discreet subjects, therefore, follow the flag
  or banner displayed to rebellions, and borne by rebels, though it
  have the image of the plough painted therein, with _God speed the
  plough_ written under in great letters, knowing that none hinder
  the plough more than rebels, who will neither go to the plough
  themselves, nor suffer other that would go unto it."--_Fourth
  Part of the Homily against Wilful Rebellion_, p. 518.

In _what_ rebellion was such a banner carried?

These questions may appear very trifling; but each man has his
hobby, and mine is, not to suffer a quotation to pass without
verification.

It is fortunate that I am not a despotic monarch, as I would
certainly make it felony without benefit of clergy to quote a
passage without giving a plain reference.

MINOR QUERIES

_Pope's Translations of Horace._--In a pamphlet against Pope,
entitled, _A True Character of Mr. Pope and his Writings_, by
the author of _The Critical History of England_, written in
May, 1716, and printed in that year, Pope is reproached with having
just published a "libellous," "impudent," and "execrable"
_Imitation of Horace_. Twenty years later such a reproach would
be very intelligible; but can any one favour me with a reference to
any _Imitation of Horace_, published by Pope prior to 1716, of
which any such complaint could be made?

C.


_Etymology of "Havior."_--Can any of your readers inform me
what is the etymology of the word _Havior_, by which all
park-keepers denote an emasculated male deer, affording good venison
between the buck and doe season?

Never having seen the word written or printed, I am guided, in
attempting to spell it, by the usual pronunciation.

_Arabic Numerals_.--In the _Archaeological Journal_ (vol.
vi. p. 291.), it is stated that the earliest "example of the use of
Arabic numerals in any work connected with building" is the date
1445, on the tower of Heathfield Church, Sussex, though "they were
common in MSS. after 1320, and in astronomical Tracts as early as
1290." As it is probable that not a few instances of the employment
of the Arabic numeral characters of an earlier date than that at
Heathfield are to be met with in different parts of the country,
will you permit me to make use of your paper to inquire whether any
such are known to any of your readers, and if they will be so
obliging as to communicate their knowledge through the medium of
your columns? As the subject is one of considerable interest, it
would be desirable that _any_ date belonging to the fifteenth
or the early part of the sixteenth century should be made known, and
registered in your valuable publication.

Permit me also to ask, in connection with this subject, for
references to any works or treatises supplying information on the
history of the Arabic numerals, their origin, and their introduction
into Europe. I am already acquainted with Astle, _On Writing_,
Wallis's _Algebra, Nouveau Traite de Diplomatique_, the
_Huctiana_, Pegge's _Life of Grostete_, and the
_Philosophical Transactions_; but I wish for additional, and,
if possible, more recent information.

Does any one of your readers know what became of the MSS. formerly
in the possession of the above-named Thomas Astle, formerly Keeper
of the Tower Records? In Sir W. Burrell's Sussex collections in the
British Museum are copies of charters, "ex MSS. penes T. Aste," with
notices of curious seals appended, which I should be glad to be able
to inspect.

_Stephen Eiton, or Eden's "Acta Regis Edw. II._"--The

Regis Edwardi iidi," which is said still to remain in manuscript.

And the editor of the continuation of Dodsley's
_Collection_ remarks on the passage,--

   "Why the cuckoo is called the Welch Embassador, I know not."

{231}Perhaps some of your readers can explain why the cuckoo is so
called.

_A recent Novel_.--Having lately met with an extremely rare

France, ensemble le razement de leur fort et le retablissement d'un
autre pour le service du Roi ... en la Nouvelle France ... par le
sieur Malepart. Rouen, le Boullenger, 1630. 12o. 24pp." I was
reminded of a modern novel, the principal scenes of which are laid
in an island inhabited by a British nobleman of high rank, who,
having committed a political crime, had been reported dead, but was
saved by singular circumstances, and led the life of a buccaneer.
Can any of your numerous readers be good enough to mention the title
of the novel alluded to, which has escaped my memory?

P.S.


_Seal of Killigrew, and Genealogy of the Killigrew
Family_.--"BURIENSIS" (No. 13. p. 204.) is informed that the arms
on the seal at Sudbury are certainly those of a member of the old
Cornish house of Killigrew. These arms, impaled by those of Lower,
occur on a monument at Llandulph, near Saltash, to the memory of Sir
Nicholas Lower, and Elizabeth his wife, who died in 1638. She was a
daughter of Sir Henry Killegrewe, of London, and a near relative, I
believe, of the Master of the Revels.

While on this subject, I beg to put a query to your genealogical
readers. The double-headed eagle, the bordure bizantee, and the
demilion charged with bezants, are all evident derivations from the
armorial bearings of Richard, titular king of the Romans, Earl of
Cornwall, &c., second son of King John. The family of Killegrewe is
of venerable antiquity in Cornwall. What I wish to ascertain is, the
nature of the connection between the family and that unfortunate
"king." Was it one of consanguinity, or merely one of feudal
dependence?

REPLIES.

SELAGO AND SAMOLUS.

In common with the mistletoe and vervain the Druids held the Selago
and Samolus as sacred plants, and never approached them but in the
most devout and reverential manner. When they were gathered for
religious purposes the greatest care was taken lest they should fall
to the earth, for it was an established principle of Druidism, that
every thing that was sacred would be profaned if allowed to touch
the ground; hence their solicitude to catch the anguinum:


   "------------------When they bear
    Their wond'rous egg aloof in air:
    Thence before to earth it fall,
    The Druid in his hallow'd pall
    Receives the prize."

Pliny, in his _Natural History_ (lib. xxiv. cap. 11.)
gives a circumstantial account of the ceremonies
used by the Druids in gathering the Selago and
Samolus, and of the uses to which they were applied:--


   "Similis berbae huie sabinae est Selago appellata. Legitur
    sine ferro dextra manu per tunicam, qua sinistra
    exuitur velut a furante, candida veste vestito, pureque
    lotis nudis pedibus, saero facto priusquam legatur,
    pane vinoque. Fertur in mappa nova. Hanc contra omnem
    perniciem habendam prodidere Druidae Gallorum, et contra
    omnia oculorum vitia fumum ejus prodesse.


    "Iidem Samolum herbam nominavere nascentem in humidis:
    et hanc sinistra manu legi a jejunis contra morbos suum
    boumque, nec respicere legentem: nec alibi quam in
    canali, deponere, ibique conterere poturis."

From the very slight manner in which these plants are described by
Pliny, it is next to impossible to identify them with any degree of
certainty, though many attempts for the purpose have been made. So
far as I know, Pliny is the only ancient author who mentions them,
and we have therefore nothing to guide us beyond what he has said in
this passage.

The word Selago is supposed to be derived from _se_ and
_lego_, i.e. _quid certo ritu seligeretur_. Linnaeus
appropriated the name to a pretty genus of Cape plants, but which
can have nothing whatever to do with the Selago of the Druids. It
has been thought to be the same as the Serratula Chamaepeuce of
Linnaeus, but without sufficient reason, for Pliny says it resembles
the savine; and Matthiolus, in his _Commentary on Dioscorides_,
when speaking of the savine (Juniperus Sabina), says:--

   "Siquidem vidi pro Sabina assumi quandam herbam
    dodrantalem quae quibusdam in montibus plurima nascitur,
    folio tamaricis, licet nec odore nec sapore Sabinam
    Hanc saepius existimavi esse Selaginem referat. a Plinio
    lib. xxiv. c. 11. commemoratam."

Samolus, or as some copies read Samosum, is said to be derived
from two Celtic words, _san_, salutary, and _mos_, pig;
denoting a property in the plant which answers to the description of
Pliny, who says the Gauls considered the Samolus as a specific in
all maladies of swine and cattle. {232}But there is not less
difficulty in identifying this plant than in the former case. Some
have thought it the same as the little marsh plant, with small white
flowers, which Linnaeus calls Samolus Valerandi, while others
consider it to be the Anemone Pulsatilla. I am ignorant of the
salutary properties of these plants, and must leave it to be decided
which of them has the greatest claims to be considered the Samolus
of Pliny.

_Selago and Samolus_.--The Selago (mentioned by "PWCCA," No.
10. p. 157.), in Welsh _Gras Duw_ (Gratia Dei), was held by the
Druids as a charm against all misfortunes; they called it _Dawn y
Dovydd_, the gift of the Lord. They also ascribed great virtues
to the Samolus, which was called _Gwlydd_, mild or tender. All
that can be known respecting the Selago and Samolus, may be seen in
Borlase's _Antiquities of Cornwall_.

AELFRIC'S COLLOQUY.

In the Anglo-Saxon _Gloss_, to AElfric's Latin dialogue,
_higdifatu_ is not, I conceive, an error of the scribe, but a
variation of dialect, and therefore, standing in no need of
correction into _hydigfatu_ ("NOTES and QUERIES," No. 13.).
_Hig, hi_ and _hy_, are perfectly identical, and nothing
is more usual in A.S. than the omission of the final _g_ after
_i_; consequently, _hig=hy, di=dig_, therefore _higdi=hydig_.
Mr. Singer's reading of _cassidilia_ for _culidilia_, I consider
to be well-founded.

His conjecture, that _sprote_=Goth. _sprauto_, has
something very specious about it, and yet I must reject it. That
useful and sagacious author, Dr. Kitchener, tells us, that there is
only one thing to be done in a hurry (or _sprauto_); and even
if he had not informed us what that one thing is, very few indeed
would ever have imagined that it was _fish_-catching. The word
_sprote_ was a puzzle to me, and I had often questioned myself
as to its meaning, but never could get a satisfactory answer; nor
was it until some time after the publication of the 2nd edition of
my _Analecta_ that it occurred to me that it might signify a
wicker or _sallow_ basket (such as is still in use for the
capture of eels), from Lat. _sporta_, whence the German
_sportel_. My conjecture, of _salice_ for the _salu_
of the text, was based on the possibility that the apparatus might
somehow or other be made of the _salix_.

I beg leave to inform "SELEUCUS," that _The Phoenix_, with an
English version, and with the Latin original, is to be found in the
_Codex Exoniensis_, edited by me, in 1842, for the Society of
Antiquaries. The Latin ascribed to Lactantius, is printed in the
Variourum edition of Claudian, and, I believe, in the editions of
Lactantius.

PORTRAITS OF LUTHER AND ERASMUS.

Your correspondent, "R.G." (No. 13. p. 203.), is correct in
supposing the _wood-cut_ portrait of Luther to be that which is
prefixed to the treatise "De Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae," where
he is habited as a monk; but it was evidently only a copy from the
very interesting copper-plate engraving of his friend Lucas Cranach,
bearing the date 1520, of which a very accurate copy was prefixed to
the translation of "Luther's Way to Prayer," published by Mr.
Pickering in 1846. Juncker's book is a very good repertory of the
various representations of the great reformer, but the prints are
generally but faithless copies. In 1750 Kirchmayer printed an
especial disquisition upon the portrait by Lucas Cranach of 1523,
under the following title:--"Disquisitio Historia de Martini Lutheri
Oris et Vultus Habitu Hervieo ad vivum expresso in Imagine divine
pencilli Lucae Cranachj patris in aere hic incisa," &c., Wittebergae
Sax. 1750, 4to. The works in which the Germans have sought to do
honour to their great protestant saint, are numerous enough to fill
a small library but two of them are so remarkable as to deserve
notice, 1. "Luther's Merkwuerdige Lebensumstande bey seiner
Medicinalischen Leibesconstitution, Krankheiten, geistlichen und
leiblichen Anfectungen und andern Zufallen, &c., von F.G. Keil,"
Leipsig, 1764. 2. "Luther's Merkwuerdige Reisegeschichte zu Erganzung
seiner Lebensumstande, von Jo. Th. Lingke," Leipsig, 1769, 4to. The
earliest wood-cut representation of Erasmus with which I am
acquainted is a medallion accompanying another of Ulric of Hutten,
on the title-page of the following work of the unfortunate but
heroic champion of the Reformation:--"Ulrichi ab Hutten cum Erasmo
Rotirodamo, Presbytero, Theologo, Expostulatio." There is reason to
believe that this Expostulation was printed only a short month
before Hutten died; and, though it bears neither date nor name of
printer, that it was printed by Johannes Schott, at Strasburg, in
the month of July, 1523. It has another portrait of Hutten at the
end, the whole strikingly spirited and characteristic; by some they
have been attributed to Holbein, and if not by him, which is
doubtful, they are at least worthy of him.

One would gladly forget this strife between the great promoter of
learning and the soldier-scholar. Erasmus's conduct was unworthy of
a great man, and can never be vindicated.

{233} REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.

_Praise undeserved_.--The correct quotation, referred to in No.
14. p. 222., is

    "Praise undeserved is _Satire_ in disguise."

It is by Mr. Br----st, author of a copy of verses called the
_British Beauties_. I cannot fill up the "hiatus," which in
this case is not "maxime deflendus," because I have now no time to
search the Museum Catalogue. I apprehend that the author belonged to
the "mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease," as it is something like
Savage's "tenth transmitter" (which, by the bye, your correspondent,
Mr. Gutch, should have said is _said_ to be Pope's)--his
_only good_ line. Here is my authority:


EPIGRAM

_On a certain line of Mr. Br----, author of a copy of verses
called the "British Beauties."--From the_ "GARLAND," _a
collection of Poems_, 1721.

   "When one good line did much my wonder raise
    In Br----st's works, I stood resolved to praise;
    And had, but that the modest _author_ cries,
    _Praise undeserv'd is satire in disguise_."

I would add, that I believe this Epigram to be Dr. Kenrick's,
Goldsmith's old persecutor in later years.

_Discurs. Modest._--At p. 205. No. 13., your correspondent N.

that the _original_ authority for _Rem transubstantiationis
patres ne altigisse quidem_, is William Watson in his _Quodlibet_,
ii. 4. p. 31."

By a note of mine, I find that this secular priest, W. Watson, lays
the expression in question to the charge of the Jesuits as "an
heretical and most dangerous assertion of theirs." Admitting,
therefore, the _Discurs. Modest_. to have been published after
Watson's _Decacordon_, i.e. later than 1602 (which can hardly
be doubted), still the further question remains to be asked: "In
what writings of the Jesuits, prior to 1602, had W. Watson himself
found these words, with which he charges them?" Should you think
this further query of importance enough to find a place in your
paper, perhaps some one of your readers might throw yet another ray
of light upon this subject.

is applied in Totnes to denote a landing-place inclosed by walls,
but not roofed in. Many of these "pallaces" have been converted into
coal-cellars. Perhaps _pales_ may have been used originally to
form these inclosures in lieu of walls;--and hence the word
"pallace" would mean a place paled in. I find repeated mention made
of "pallaces" in a schedule attached to a deed of the Corporation of
Totnes, bearing date September 18th, 1719, a copy of which is now
before me, and from it the following extracts are taken:--

   "One linney and two _pallaces_ or yards."

   "All those houses, rooms, cellars, and _pallaces_."

   "All that great cellar lately rebuilt, and _the plott of ground
    or pallace_ thereto belonging lately converted into a cellar."

   "All that little cellar and _pallace_ lately rebuilt, and
    the kay or landing place thereto belonging, and near adjoyning
    unto and upon the river Dart."

   "And the little _pallace_ or _landing-place_."

_Apropos_ of _landing-places_, it may interest some of
your readers to learn that the _very stone_ upon which Brutus,
the nephew of AEneas, landed at Totnes, still remains! It is inserted
in the foot-way nearly opposite the Mayoralty-house in the Fore
Street. From Totnes, the neighbouring shore was heretofore called
_Totonese_: and the _British History_ tells us, that _Brutus_,
the founder of the British nation, arrived here; and _Havillanus_
[John de _Alvilla_ or _Hauteville_, according to Mr. Wright] as
a poet, following the same authority, writes thus:--

   "Inde dato cursu, _Brutus_ comitatus Achate
    Gallorum spoliis cumulatis navibus aequor
    Exarat, et superis auraque faventibus usus,
    _Littora felices intrat Totonesia portus_."

    "From hence great Brute with his Achates steer'd,
    Full fraught with Gallic spoils their ships appear'd;
    The Winds and Gods were all at their command,
    _And happy Totnes shew'd them grateful land_."

_Gibson's Camden_.


Totnes is made mention of the _Lais de Marie_:--

   "Il tient sun chemin tut avant.
    A la mer vient, si est passer,
    En _Toteneis_ est arriver."--_Lai d'Elidne_.

_Litany Version of the Psalms_.--The doubts produced by Beloe's
self-contradicting statements on the subject of the Bishops' Bible,
which are referred to by "X.X." (No. 13. p. 203.), may thus be
settled. The first edition of this Bible, printed in 1568, contains
a new translation of the Psalms by Becon. In the second folio
edition, 1572, are inserted, in opposite columns, "the translation
according to the Ebrewe," which differs but little from the former,
in Roman letter, and "the translation used in common prayer," or
that of the Great Bible, printed by Whitchurch, 1553, in black
letter.

The clarum et venerabile nomen associated with the Bishops' Bible, a
very magnificent and perfect copy of which is now open before me,
suggests the inquiry whether there is any copy known of Archbishop
Parker's rare volume on the English Church, 1572, which is not
noticed by Martin in the list of eighteen which he had discovered.
He does not mention that in the Chetham library.

_Tempora mutantur &c_.--In reply to your correspondent, "E.V."
(No. 14. p. 215.), I beg to state, that the _germ_ of "Tempora
mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis," is to be found in the _Delitiae
Poetarium Germanorum_, vol. i. p. 685., under the Poems of
Matthias Borbonius. He considers them as a saying of Lotharius I.
(flor. Cir. 830.):--

   "Omnia mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis;
    Illa vices quasdam res habet, illa suas."

I sent this communication, some years ago, to _Sharpe's
Magazine_, where it will be found, vol. v. p. 208.

_Pandoxare_.--Your correspondent, "H.B." (No. 13. p. 202.), has
lighted upon a curious specimen of domestic hieroglyphics, the
notice of which recalls to mind the quaint marginal symbols
scattered over the inventories of the Exchequer Treasury, at a much
earlier period. They are not devoid of information or interest. The
word of which he requests explanation, is, indeed, of too base
Latinity to be found in the _Facciolati_, or even in the
_Auctarium_; but in our old Latin dictionaries, sources of
abundant information on obsolete expressions, the word is readily to
be found. Old Gouldman, for instance, whose columns are replete with
uncommon and local English terms, gives "_Pandoxor_, to brew,"
citing Alciatus as authority, and "_Pandox_, a swill-bowl,"
apparently a word used by Statius. It is obviously a barbarous
derivative of the same Greek words as _Pandocium_ or _Pandoxarium_
([Greek: pan] and [Greek: docheion]), the hostelry open to
all comers. If, however, a more recondite authority for the
explanation of the word, as formerly used in England, be
desired, I would refer your querist to the pages of the
_Promptorium Parvulorum_, where may be found--"Bruwyn ale or
other drynke, _Pandoxor_. Browstar, or brewere, _Pandoxator,
Pandoxatrix_", the medieval Bass or Guinness having been, most
frequently, a female. And, having cited the primitive lexicographer
of Norfolk, I would seize the occasion to offer a note, in response
to the numerous queries regarding the too tardy advance of the work
in question, and to assure your readers, who may be interested in
the publications of the Camden Society, that a further instalment of
the _Promptorium_ is in forwardness, so that I hope to complete
a considerable portion, in readiness for issue, early in the current
year.

_Saint Thomas of Lancaster_.--Not having Brady at hand, I
cannot tell what authorities he cites; but, as Mr. Milnes (No. 12.
p. 181.) does not mention Rymer, he perhaps may not know that he
will find in that collection some documentary evidence on the
subject of this saint, if saint he was; for instance--

   "_Super rumore Thomam nuper Comitem Lancastriae miraculis
    corruscuri_."--Rym. Foed. iii. p. 1033. A.D. 1323.
   "Quod," adds the king, "moleste gerimus."

But Edward III. was of quite another mind, and urged his
canonization of the Holy See. Witness Rymer:--

   "_Ad Papam; pro canonisatione Thomae nuper Comitis
    Lancastriae_."--Foed. iv. p. 2. A.D. 1326.

And again--

   "_Pro custodi_" (Weryngton mentioned by Mr. Milnes),
   "_Capellae ad montem ubi nuper comes Lancastriae decollatus
    fuit_."--Ib. p. 291.

It seems that the bodies of some of Thomas's accomplices were also
supposed to have worked miracles; for we find an ordinance--

   "_Contra Fingentes miracula fieri per inimicos Regis_."
    --Rym. Foed. iv. p. 20. A.D. 1323.

Andrews says (_Hist_. i. 342.) that Richard II. renewed the
application for Thomas's canonization; but he does not give his
authority, and I have not time to look further through Rymer.

p. 184. _Jhon-John_.--I wonder Mr. Williams does not see that the
_h_ is not "_introduced_" for any purpose; it is an integral
part of the original name _Johannes_, which was contracted
into _Johan_, and in French into _Jehan_.

p. 185. _Slang Phrases_.--"_A Rowland for an Oliver_" is
no slang phrase of the eighteenth century; it is a proverbial
expression as old as the days of the romances of _Roland_ and
_Olivier_. The other two were phrases put into the mouths of
two characters (Dr. Ollapod, in Colman's _Poor Gentleman_, and
Young Rapid, in Morton's _Cure for the Heart-ache_), which grew
into vogue only from the success of the actors Fawcett and Lewis,
and had no meaning or allusion beyond what the words obviously
meant.

{235}_Full of Rain in England._--"ROYDON" (No. 11. p. 73) will
find the average quantity of rain fallen at Greenwich, for
twenty-five years, 1815 to 1839, in a very useful and clever
pamphlet, price 1s., by J.H. Belville, of the Royal Observatory,
published by Taylor, Red Lion Court, Fleet Street, called _Manual
of the Mercurial and Aneroid Barometers._

_Judas Bell_--(No. 13, p. 195). In the "Flyting of Dunbar and
Kennedie," a singular Scotch Poem, composed in the former half of
the 16th century, and printed in Ramsay's _Evergreen_, the
following passage occurs (_Everg._ vol. ii. p. 74.):--

   "A Benefice quha wald give sic a Beist,
      But gif it were to jingle _Judas bells_?
    Tak thee a Fiddle or a Flute to jest,
      Undocht thou art, ordained for naithing ells."

The Judas bells may probably have been used in the Easter-eve
ceremonies, in connexion with which we find _Judas candles_
mentioned. See Brand's _Popular Antiq._ by Sir H. Ellis, vol.
i. p. 29.

_Boduc or Boduoc on British Coins_.--The real name of the
heroic queen of the Iceni is very uncertain. Walther (Tacitus, xiv.
Ann. c. 31.), adopts Boudicea. It is probable enough that the
syllables Boduo may have formed a part of it, as pronounced by the
Britons. We are reminded of Boduognatus, leader of the Nervii,
mentioned by Caesar. But to come nearer home, the name Boduogenus is
found upon a bronze vessel discovered in the Isle of Ely, described
by Mr. Goddard Johnson, _Archaeologia_, xxviii. p. 436.

translation of seven psalms, the 1st, 12th, 90th, 104th, 126th,
127th, and 149th, with a Dedication to George Herbert, is found at
the end of the 2nd vol. of his works. (Lond. 1826.) They were
printed at London, 1625, in quarto.

_A "Gib" Cat._--What is the etymology of the term "Gibbe," as
applied to the male cat? I may observe that the _g_ is pronounced
_hard_ in this locality, and not _jibbe_, as most dictionaries
have it.

Burnley, Lancashire.

T.T.W.

  [NARES has shown, very satisfactorily, that _Gib_, the
  contraction of _Gilbert_, was the name formerly applied to a
  cat, as _Tom_ is now. He states that _Tibert_ (the name
  given to the Cat in the old Reynard the Fox) was the old French for
  _Gilbert_; and at all events, be that as it may, Chaucer, in
  his _Romance of the Rose_, verse 6204., translates "Thibert le
  Cas" by "Gibbe our Cat."]


_Lay of the Phoenix._--"SELEUCUS" is informed that the
Anglo-Saxon Lay of the Phoenix is contained in the _Codex
Exoniensis_, edited by Mr. B. Thorpe. The Latin poem, in
hexameters and pentameters, attributed to Lactantius, is given at
the foot of the page. It will be found at the end of the works of
Lactantius, in the small edition by Fritzsche (Lipsiae, 1842).
Fritzsche mentions two separate editions of the poem; 1. by Martini,
Lunaeburgi, 1825; 2. by Leyser, Quedlinburgi, 1839.

C.W.G.


_Lay of the Phoenix._--"SELEUCUS" (No. 13, p. 203.) asks, "Is
there any published edition of the hexameter poem by Lactantius,
which is said to have suggested the idea of the Anglo-Saxon _Lay
of the Phoenix_?" This poem is not in hexameter, but in elegiac
verse; and though, on account of its brevity, we could not expect
that it would have been separately published, it is to be found very
commonly at the end of the works of Lactantius; for example, in
three editions before me, Basil. 1524, Lugd. 1548, Basil. 1563. That
this poem, however, belongs to the Christian Cicero, at any period
of his life, is more than doubtful, even by the admission of
Romanists, who readily avail themselves of other compositions of
similar authority. It has been sometimes ascribed to Venantius
Fortunatus, and is by Sirmondus attributed to Theodulphus, Bishop of
Orleans. (_Opp._, ii. 840. cf. iv. 519. Venet. 1728.)

_Ordination Pledges._--Your correspondent, "CLERICUS" (no. 10.

examination of the import, design, and obligation of the various
oaths and subscriptions required of the clergy, in the successive
numbers of _The Christian Observer_ for 1849.

_Feast of St, Michael and All-Angels._--The difficulty started
by "K.M.P." (No. 13, p. 203.), with regard to the double second
lessons for the Feast of St. Michael and All-Angels, is easily
resolved by comparing the Table of Proper Lessons before and after
the last review of the _Prayer Book_ in 1662; from which it
will be seen, that the proper _second_ lessons were then
appointed for the first time, while the old second lessons for Sept.
29. were retained, either from inadvertence, or to avoid the
necessity of disarranging all the subsequent part of the calendar.
The present first lessons, Gen. xxxii., and Dan. x. v. 5., at the
same time took the place of the inappropriate chapters, Eccles.
xxxix. and xliv., which had been appointed for this day in Queen
Elizabeth's Prayer Book, 1559.

_Beaver Hat._--Mr. T. Hudson Turner (No. 7. p. 100.) asks,
"What is the earliest known instance of the use of a _beaver
hat_ in England?"

(236}Fairholt (_Costume in England_) says, the earliest notice
of it is in the reign of Elizabeth, and gives the following
quotation from Stubbe's _Anatomy of Abuses,_ 1580:--

   "And as the fashions be rare and strange, so is the stuff
    whereof their hats be made divers also; for some are
    of silk, some of velvet, some of taffetie, some of sarcenet,
    some of wool, and, which is more curious, some of a certain
    kind of fine haire; these they call _bever hattes_, of
    xx, xxx, or xl shillings price, fetched from beyond the seas,
    from whence a great sort of other varieties doe come besides."

GASTROS.


_Meaning of "Pisan."_--Mr. Turner (No. 7. p.100.) asks the
meaning of the term _pisan_, used in old records for some part
of defensive armour.

Meyrick (_Ancient Armour_, vol. i. p. 155, 2d ed.) gives a
curious and interesting inventory of the arms and armour of Louis le
Hutin, King of France, taken in the year 1316, in which we find,
"Item 3 coloretes _Pizanes_ de jazeran d'acier." He describes
_pizane_ (otherwise written _pizaine, pusen, pesen_) as a
collar made, or much in fashion, at Pisa. The jazeran armour was
formed of overlapping plates. In the metrical romance of _Kyng
Alisaunder_, edited by Webber, occur the lines--

   "And Indiens, and Emaniens,
    With swordes, lances, and _pesens._"

Weber explains the _pesens_ here as gorgets, armour for the
neck.

In more recent MSS. _pisan_ may be a contraction for
_partisan_, a halberd.

I cannot agree with your correspondent "A.F." (p.90), that the nine
of diamonds was called "the curse (cross) of Scotland" from its
resemblance to the cross of St. Andrew, which has the form of the
Roman X; whereas the pips on the nine of diamonds are arranged in
the form of the letter H. "Mend the instance."

Erratum. P. 181 col. 2. line 3., for _obscurities_, read

GASTROS.


_Pokership--God tempers the Wind_.--I am disposed to think that
_Parkership_ will turn out to be the right explanation, because
almost every forest or chase contained a _fenced park_, in
which the deer were confined; and the charge of the woods and park
might be consigned to the same person; and the error in spelling the
word was probably copied from one genealogist to another.

Nevertheless, Mr. Corney's conjecture may be right, as Forby
(_Vocabulary,_ vol. ii. p. 258.) mentions Poke-Day as the day
on which the allowance of corn is made to the labourers, _who, in
some places, receive a part of their wages in that form._ Now the
_Pokerer_ might be the officer who distributed the grain on
these occasions.

I open my note to add, that Mr. Gutch (No. 14. p. 211.) will find,
in Sterne's _Sentimental Journey_,--"_God tempers the wind_,"
said Maria, "to the shorn lamb."

The words which I have underlined are printed in Italics in my
edition of the work (London, 12mo. 1790), which may indicate that
they are quoted from some other author.

_Walewich or Watewich._--I have made the reference suggested by
"W.B.M."

Canute was residing at Walewich, and the Abbot of Ely was
consecrated there by the Archbishop of Canterbury. This "Walewich"
can be no obscure place, and we need not look for it in
Cambridgeshire.

I am inclined to think that the word ought to have been written
Warewich, _i.e._ Warwick.

Soham Mere (Mare de Soham) once covered 1369-1/2 acres.--Lyson's

of the Bedford Level, which is in the Museum.

_Madoc's Emigration to America._--"ANGLO-CAMBRIAN" (No. 4. p.
57.), in contradiction to the occurrence of Madoc's emigration, has
adduced what he supposes to be a gross anachronism in the words
"Madoc was directed by the _best compass_, and this in 1170!"
Now, unfortunately for this opinion, the passage on which it is
founded will not allow of his interpretation. The original words are
in Sir Thomas Herbert's _Travels_, and, in his expressive
language, they are as follows:--"By Providence, the best compass,
and benefit of the pole-star, he returned safely to his own
country." Most certainly this cannot imply that Madoc was acquainted
with the mariner's compass.

"J.M.T." also seems to give great weight to the fact of a
"Welsh-Indian vocabulary" having been formed, containing no trace of
any Celtic root. This seems conclusive, yet it is not so; for I have
some words, extracted from a vocabulary of the Mandan (Indian)
language made by Mr. Catlin, during his sojourn among them, all of
which, with very slight allowance for corruption, are clearly Welsh.
Mr. Catlin believes the Mandans to have been descended from the
followers of Prince Madoc, from the strong evidence which he
considers his stay among them afforded him, and detailed in his work
on the Indians. I regret to add, that the Mandans have been
exterminated by the small-pox and the weapons of their enemies. I
have long taken a deep, because a national, interest in this
question, and have endeavoured to examine in the spirit of that
noble {237}precept, which ought to be bound up with the existence of
every _Cymro_, "The truth against the world." Consequently, I
have found that much of what is put forth as evidence on this
question is, as Mr. Corney has very justly intimated, quite
inadmissible; in short, unworthy of belief. Still, the inquiry has
afforded me sufficient reasons for viewing the question of Prince
Madoc's emigration as a fact, and for supporting it as such as far
as my humble testimony will allow.

_Caerphili Castle_.--With reference to "PWCCA'S" query (No. 10.
p. 157.), it may be noted that _Full_ is the Welsh word for
"haste," and, if the _derivatur_, must allude to the original
structure having been hastily erected.

_Origin of word Bug_.--I should feel obliged by your informing
me whether the word _Bug_ is not of _Celtic_ origin, signifying
a "_Ghost_ or _Goblin_?" Vide Shakespeare's _Taming of the Shrew_,
Act I. Scene II.:--

   "Tush, tush, fright boys with _bugs_."

And whether, in _Mathews'_ Bible, A.D. 1537, the 5th verse of
the 91st Psalm is not thus rendered:--

   "Thou shalt not need to be afraid of any _bugs_ by night"?

literally, in the Hebrew, "_Terror_ of the night."

J.P.

  [_Bug_ in Welsh means a ghost or goblin. It is probably the
  same with the Icelandic _Paki_, an evil spirit. But on this
  etymology our correspondent can consult an article by Sir F.
  Palgrave, on the "Popular Mythology of the Middle Ages." in the
  _Quarterly Review_, vol. xxii.; a paper, by Mr. Thoms, on the
  "Folk Lore of Shakspeare," No. 6.; "Puck's several Names," in _The
  Athenaeum_, Oct. 9. 1847; and lastly, Mr. Keightley's most
  interesting work, _The Fairy Mythology_. vol. ii. p. 118., of
  which we are happy to hear that a new and enlarged edition may
  shortly be expected.]

MISCELLANIES.

_Excecution of Duke of Monmouth._--Among the memorials of the
"rash but unfortunate Duke of Monmouth," which have recently
attracted much attention, and for which the public are principally
indebted to certain inquiries originated in the "NOTES AND QUERIES,"
I have not observed any notice taken of an anecdote respecting him,
which is current among our neighbours on the Continent; namely, that
he gave six guineas to the executioner, the JOHN KETCH of that day,
to perform his work well!--

   "Le Duc de Monmout donna six guinees au Bourreau de Londres,
    pour lui bien couper la tete; mais le miserable ne merroit
    par ces guinees, puisqu'il la lui coupa tres mal."


This anecdote is introduced, in the form of a note, into the folio
Dictionary of Pierre Richelet, a most valuable work, and full of
history, ancient and modern. Can any of your correspondents produce
the authority for this anecdote? Richelet himself does not give any,
but merely relates the story, apparently with a view of illustrating
the term "guinea," as applied to the gold coin of Charles the
Second. Vid, voc. "_Guinee_."

J.I.


_By Hook or by Crook_.--I send you a note, which I made some
years ago.

This expression is much more ancient than the time of Charles I., to
which it is generally referred. It occurs in Skelton, _Colin
Clout_, line 31. _a fine_:--

   "Nor wyll suffer this boke
    _By hooke ne by crooke_
    Prynted for to be."

In Spenser, f. 2. v. ii. 27.:--

   "Thereafter all that mucky pelfe he tooke,
    The spoile of peoples evil gotten good,
    The which her sire had serap't by hooke and crooke,
    And burning all to ashes pour'd it down the brooke."

In Holland's _Suetonius_, p. 169:--

   "Likewise to get, to pill and poll _by hooke and crooke_
    so much, as that----"

In a letter of Sir Richard Morysin to the Privy
Council, in Lodges _Illustrations, &c_., i. 154:--

   "Ferrante Gonzaga, d'Arras, and Don Diego, are in a leage,
    utterlie bent to myslyke, and to charge _by hook or by
    crooke_, anything don, or to be don, by the thre fyrst."

_Cupid Crying_.--The beautiful epigram upon this subject, which
appeared in No. 11 p. 172., was kindly quoted, "for its extreme
elegance," by the _Athenaeum_ of the 26th January, which
produced the following communication to that journal of Saturday
last:--

"Will the correspondent of the 'NOTES AND QUERIES,' whose pretty
epigram appears copied into your _Athenaeum_ of Saturday last,
accept the following as a stop-gap pending the discovery of the
Latin original?

   "En lacrymosus Amor! Fidem quia perdidit arcum
      Vapulat! Exultans Caelia tela tenet.
    Ast illam potuitne Puer donare sagittis?
      Subrisit:--Matrem credidit esse suam.

"[Greek: Amorphota]. 5."


_Miry-land Town._--As an addition to the note of "J.R.F." (p.
167. No. 11.) on Miry-land Town, and by way of corroboration of his
reading, I may just mention that the towns and villages in the Weald
of Kent are familiarly spoken of as places "down in the mud," by the
inhabitants of other parts of the country. Those who are acquainted
with the Weald will agree that this designation is not undeserved.

We have great pleasure in directing attention to the _Exhibition
of Works of Ancient and Mediaeval Art_ which is to be opened in
the Adelphi next month.

This is a great opportunity for forming an Exhibition of a novel and
most interesting kind, one which is calculated both to interest and
amuse the archaeologist and the public, and to instruct the artizan
and the manufacturer. We sincerely hope possessors of articles
suitable for exhibition, will not fail to take advantage of it. They
should immediately enter into communication with the Honorary
Secretary to the Exhibition, at the rooms of the Society of Arts, or
they will be too late.

The _Gentlemen's Magazine_ realizes all our anticipations. The
Reviews are of a very superior order. Justice is done _to_ as
well as _upon_ the authors who have come under notice, and the
original articles are of high value; those upon the _Dea
Sequana_ and the _History of Words_ are especially worthy of
notice. Mr. Waller's papers upon _Christian Iconography_
promise to be of the highest value. A new career of usefulness and
honour has been opened up to Sylvanus Urban, who seems determined to
merit the addition lately made to his title, and to become what is
really a desideratum in English Literature--a good "_Historical
Review_."

Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell, on Thursday and Friday next, a
very choice Selection of Magnificent Books and Pictorial Works from
the Library of an eminent Collector, including large paper copies of
the Antiquarian Works of Visconti, Montfaucon, &c.; the first four
editions of Shakspeare, and other works of similar high character.

The above COMMITTEE has been formed for the purpose of organising an
EXHIBITION OF WORKS OF ANCIENT AND MEDIAEVAL ART. The SOCIETY OF ARTS
having considered that such an Exhibition is not only likely to be
interesting to the public, but also to be especially useful to
Manufacturers (with reference to the Exhibition of Works of Industry
of all Nations to be held in the year 1851), have placed a portion
of their Rooms at the disposal of the Committee, and have agreed to
adopt the Exhibition as part of that annually made by the Society,
thereby taking all the expenses connected with it upon themselves.
The Committee, regarding the Exhibition in the twofold character
contemplated by the Society of Arts, have resolved that the objects
of ancient and mediaeval art of which the Exhibition is to be
composed, shall, as far as possible, be selected with reference to
their beauty and the practical illustration which they are likely to
afford of processes of manufacture; and now beg to invite the
possessors of Works deemed suitable for such an exhibition to assist
the Committee in their very important office, by entering into
communication with them, respecting the nature of any objects which
they may be willing to offer for exhibition.

It is requested that all Works proposed for exhibition be punctually
sent to the Rooms of the SOCIETY OF ARTS, John Street, Adelphi, on
or before the 20th of February, it being imperative that the
Exhibition should open in early March.

Letters and Communications should be addressed to AUGUSTUS W.
FRANKS, Esq. Honorary Secretary to the Committee, Society of Arts,
John Street, Adelphi.

By order of the Committee, AUGUSTUS W. FRANKS Hon. Sec.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
