PREFACE


This index, the plan of which is similar to that of the well known
Granger index to recitations, was suggested by demands from St. Louis
kindergartners for the location of songs for which they were searching.
The idea is due to Mrs. Harriet P. Sawyer, Chief of the Instruction
Department in the St. Louis Public Library, and valuable preliminary
work was done also by Miss Effie L. Power, Supervisor of Children's
Work, and by Miss Margaret Curran, Children's Librarian at the Divoll
Branch. The Librarian has had nothing to do with it except to give
advice occasionally in matters of policy.

It was expected at first that the St. Louis Public Library would publish
the index, but it has proved to be larger than was anticipated, and the
Publishing Board of the American Library Association has kindly relieved
us of this part of the enterprise.

    ARTHUR E. BOSTWICK,

  Librarian St. Louis Public Library.




PLAN OF THE INDEX


Three types of books are indexed:--those containing only kindergarten
songs, those containing both kindergarten and folk songs, and those
including folk songs only.

The collection indexed includes the following classes of books:

(1) Books recommended by the Kindergarten Normal Department of the St.
Louis Board of Education; (2) Books of songs and games given in the
A.L.A. Catalog, its Supplement and the A.L.A. Booklist; (3) All other
kindergarten-song books in the collection of the St. Louis Public
Library.

Sixty-three books are indexed. The list aims to be comprehensive but is
not recommended as a discriminative check-list for purchase. No
kindergarten magazines have been indexed.

The index is patterned on Granger so far as the form of entry is
concerned. The entries, all in one alphabet, are by composer, first
line, title and author of the words when he is at all important. There
are no subject headings in the main index, although a separate list of
songs for special days will be found at the end.

Whenever there is a variation, whether in composer, first line or title,
this is brought out in parenthesis below the entry. The variations
appear in every entry of any given set. In groups where it was not
possible to determine which was the parent song and which the versions,
each song has been called a variant in accordance with the practice of
the American Folk-lore Society.

An asterisk indicates that the first line and the title begin with the
same words.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
