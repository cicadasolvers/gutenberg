THE PARTHENON BY WAY OF PAPENDRECHT

By F. Hopkinson Smith

1909


"WILYUM!....._Wilyum!_.....WILYUM!"

It was mine host of the Ferry Inn at Cook-ham who was calling, and at
the top of his voice--and a big-chested voice it was--the sound leaping
into crescendo as the object of his search remained hidden. Then he
turned to me:

"He's somewheres 'round the boat house--you can't miss him--there's too
much of him!"

"Are ye wantin' me, sor?" came another shout as I rounded the squat
building stuffed with boats--literally so--bottom, top, and sides.

"Yes--are you the boatman?"

"I am, sor--and bloody sick of me job. Do ye see that wherry shovin'
off--the one with the lady in a sweater? Yes--that's right--just slipped
under the bridge. Well, sor, what d'ye think the bloke did for me? Look
at it, sor!" (Here he held out his hand, in which lay a half-penny.)
"And me a-washin' out 'is boat, feedin' of 'is dog, and keepin' an eye
on 'is togs and 'is ladies--and then shoves off and 'ands me this--a
'a'penny, sor--_a 'a'penny_--from the likes o' 'im to the likes o' me!
Damn 'im!"--and away went the coin into the river. "You'll excuse me,
sor, but i couldn't choke it down. Is it a punt ye're lookin' for?"

The landlord was right--there was a good deal of him--six feet and an
inch, I should think; straight as an oar, his bared arms swinging free;
waist, thighs, and back tough as a saw-log. To this was added two big
blue eyes set in a clean-shaven face bronzed by the sun, and a double
row of teeth that would have shamed an ear of corn. I caught, too, the
muscles of his chest rounding out his boating shirt, and particularly
the muscles of the neck supporting the round head crowned with closely
cropped hair--evidently a young Englishman of that great middle class
which the nation depends upon in an emergency. My inspection also
settled any question I might have had as to why he was "William," and
never "Bill," to those about him.

The one thing lacking in his make-up--and which only came into view when
he turned his head--was the upper part of one ear. This was clipped as
close as a terrier's.

Again he repeated the question--with a deprecatory smile, as if he
already regretted his outburst.

"Is it a punt ye're wantin', sor?"

"Yes--and a man to pole it and look after me while I paint. I had old
Norris for the past few years, but I hear he's gone back to gardening.
Will you have time with your other work?"

"Time! I'll chuck my job if I don't."

"No,--you can do both,--Norris did. You can pole me out to where I
want to work; bring me my lunch when you have yours, and come for me at
night. You weren't here two years ago--were you?"

"No--I was with General French. Got this clip outside Kimberly--" and he
touched his ear. "Been all my life on the river--Maidenhead and Bourne's
End mostly--and so when my time was up I come home and the boss here put
me on."

"A soldier! I thought so. I see now why you got mad. Wonder you didn't
throw that chap into the river." I am a crank on the happiness one gets
from the giving of tips--and a half-penny man is the rock bottom of
meanness.

His face straightened.

"Well, we can't do that, sor--we can't never talk back. Got to grin and
bear it or lose yer job. Learned that in the Hussahs. I didn't care for
his money--maybe it was the way he did it that set me goin'--as if I
was--Well--let it go! And it's a punt ye want?--Yes, sor--come and pick
it out."

After that it was plain sailing--or punting. The picture of that London
cad sprawling in the water, which my approval had created in his mind,
had done it. And it was early and late too (there were few visitors
that month); down by the Weir below the lock as far as Cliveden; up the
backwater to the Mill--William stretched beside me while I worked, or
pulling back and forth when a cool bottle--beer, of course--or a kettle
and an alcohol lamp would add to my comfort.

*****

Many years of tramping and boating up and down the Thames from Reading
to Maidenhead have taught me the ins and outs of the river. I know it
as I do my own pocket (and there is more in that statement than you
think--especially during regatta week).

First comes Sonning with its rose gardens and quaint brick bridge; and
then Marlowe with that long stretch of silver bordered by nodding trees
and dominated by the robber Inn--four shillings and six for a sawdust
sandwich! Then Maidenhead, swarming with boats and city folks after
dark (it is only a step from the landing to any number of curtained
sitting-rooms with shaded candles--and there be gay times at Maidenhead,
let me tell you!). And, between, best of all, lovely Cookham.

Here the river, crazy with delight, seems to lose its head and goes
meandering about, poking its nose up backwaters, creeping across
meadows, flooding limpid shallows, mirroring oaks and willows upside
down, surging up as if to sweep away a velvet-shorn lawn, only to pour
itself--its united self--into an open-mouthed lock, and so on to a saner
life in a level stretch beyond. If you want a map giving these vagaries,
spill a cup of tea and follow its big and little puddles with their
connecting rivulets: ten chances to one it will come out right.

All this William and I took in for three unbroken weeks, my usual
summer allotment on the Thames. Never was there such a breesy, wholesome
companion; stories of his life in the Veldt; of his hospital experience
over that same ear--"The only crack I got, sor, thank God!--except bein'
'alf starved for a week and down two months with the fever--" neither of
which seemed to have caused him a moment's inconvenience; stories of
the people living about him and those who came from London with a "'am
sandwidge in a noospaper, and precious little more," rolled out of him
by the hour.

And the poise of the man! When he lay stretched out beside me on
the grass while I worked--an old bivouac attitude--he kept still; no
twitching of legs or stretching of arms--lay as a big hound does, whose
blood and breeding necessitate repose.

And we were never separated. First a plunge overboard, and then a pull
back for breakfast, and off again with the luncheon tucked under the
seat--and so on until the sun dropped behind the hills.

The only days on which this routine of work and play had to be changed
were Sundays and holidays. Then my white umbrella would loom up as large
as a circus tent, the usual crowd surging about its doors. As you cannot
see London for the people, so you cannot see the river for boats on
these days--all sorts of boats--wherries, tubs, launches, racing crafts,
shells, punts--everything that can be poled, pulled, or wobbled, and in
each one the invariable combination--a man, a girl, and a dog--a dog, a
girl, and a man. This has been going on for ages, and will to the end of
time.

On these mornings William and I have our bath early--ahead of the crowd
really, who generally arrive two hours after sunrise and keep up the
pace until the last train leaves for Paddington. This bath is at the
end of one of the teacup spillways, and is called the Weir. There is a
plateau, a plunge down some twenty feet into a deep pool, and the usual
surroundings of fresh morning air, gay tree-tops, and the splash of cool
water sparkling in the sunlight.

To-day as my boat grated on the gravel my eyes fell on a young English
lord who was holding the centre of the stage in the sunlight. He was
dressed from head to foot in a skin-tight suit of underwear which had
been cut for him by a Garden-of-Eden tailor. He was just out of the
water--a straight, well-built, ruddy-skinned fellow--every inch a man!
What birth and station had done for him would become apparent when
his valet began to hand him his Bond Street outfit. The next instant
William stood beside him. Then there came a wriggle about the
shoulders, the slip of a buckle, and he was overboard and out again
before my lord had discarded his third towel.

I fell to thinking.

Naked they were equals. That was the way they came into the world and
that's the way they would go out. And yet within the hour my lord would
be back to his muffins and silver service, with two flunkies behind
his chair, and William would be swabbing out a boat or poling me home
through the pond lilies.

But why?--I kept asking myself. A totally idiotic and illogical
question, of course. Both were of an age; both would be a joy to a
sculptor looking for modern gods with which to imitate the Greek ones.
Both were equal in the sight of their Maker. Both had served their
country--my lord, I learned later, being one of the first to draw a bead
on Spion Kop close enough to be of any use--and both were honest--at
least William was--and the lord must have been.

There is no answer--never can be. And yet the picture of the two as they
stood glistening in the sunlight continues to rise in my memory, and
with it always comes this same query--one which will never down--Why
should there be the difference?

*****

But the summer is moving on apace. There is another Inn and another
William--or rather, there was one several hundred years ago before he
went off crusading. It is an old resort of mine. Seven years now has
old Leah filled my breakfast cup with a coffee that deserves a hymn of
praise in its honor. I like it hot--boiling, blistering hot, and the
old woman brings it on the run, her white sabots clattering across the
flower-smothered courtyard. During all these years I have followed
with reverent fingers not only the slopes of its roof but the loops of
swinging clematis that crowd its balconies and gabies as well. I say
"my" because I have known this Inn of William the Conqueror long
enough to include it in the list of the many good ones I frequent
over Europe--the Bellevue, for instance, at Dordrecht, over against
Papendrecht (I shall be there in another month). And the Britannia in
Venice, and I hope still a third in unknown Athens--unknown to me--my
objective point this year.

This particular Inn with the roof and the clematis, is at Dives, twenty
miles from Trouville on the coast. You never saw anything like it, and
you never will again. I hold no brief for my old friend Le Remois, the
proprietor, but the coffee is not the only thing over which grateful
men chant hymns. There is a kitchen, resplendent in polished brass,
with three French chefs in attendance, and a two-century-old spit for
roasting. There is the wine-cellar, in which cobwebs and not labels
record the age and the vintage; there is a dining-room--three of
them--with baronial fireplaces, sixteenth-century furniture, and linen
and glass to match--to say nothing of tapestries, Spanish leathers,
shrines, carved saints, ivories, and pewter--the whole a sight to turn
bric-a-brac fiends into burglars--not a difficult thing by the way--and
then, of course--there is the bill!

"Where have you been, M. Le Remois?" asked a charming woman.

"To church, Madame."

"Did you say your prayers?"

"Yes, Madame," answered this good boni-face, with a twinkle.

"What did you pray for?"

"I said--'Oh, Lord!--do not make me rich, but place me _next_ to the
rich'"--and he kept on his way rubbing his hands and chuckling. And yet
I must say it is worth the price.

I have no need of a William here--nor of anybody else. The water for my
cups is within my reach; convenient umbrellas on movable pedestals can
be shoved into place; a sheltered back porch hives for the night all my
paraphernalia and unfinished sketches, and a step or two brings me to
a table where a broiled lobster fresh from the sea and a peculiar peach
ablaze in a peculiar sauce--the whole washed down by a pint of--(No--you
can't have the brand--there were only seven bottles left when I paid my
bill)--and besides I am going back--help to ease the cares that beset a
painter's life.

But even this oasis of a garden, hemmed about as if by the froth of
Trouville and the suds of Cabourg; through which floats the gay life
of Paris resplendent in toilets never excelled or _exceeded_
anywhere--cannot keep me from Holland very long. And it is a pity too,
for of late years I have been looked upon as a harmless fixture at the
Inn--so much so that men and women pass and repass my easel, or
look over my shoulder while I work without a break in their
confidences--quite as if I was a deaf, dumb, and blind waiter, or
twin-brother to old Coco the cockatoo, who has surveyed the same scene
from his perch near the roof for the past thirty years.

None of these unconscious ear-droppings am I going to
betray--delightful, startling--_improper_, if you must have it--as some
of them were. Not the most interesting, at all events, for I promised
her I wouldn't--but there is no question as to the diversion obtained by
keeping the latch-string of your ears on the outside.

None of all this ever drips into my auricles in Holland. A country so
small that they build dikes to keep the inhabitants from being spilt
off the edge, is hardly the place for a scandal--certainly not in stolid
Dordrecht or in that fly-speck of a Papendrecht, whose dormer windows
peer over the edge of the dike as if in mortal fear of another
inundation. And yet, small as it is, it is still big enough for me to
approach it--the fly-speck, of course--by half a dozen different routes.
I can come by boat from Rotterdam. Fop Smit owns and runs it--(no kin of
mine, more's the pity)--or by train from Amsterdam; or by carriage from
any number of 'dams, 'drechts, and 'bergs. Or I can tramp it on foot, or
be wheeled in on a dog-wagon. I have tried them all, and know. Being now
a staid old painter and past such foolishness, I take the train.

Toot! Toot!--and I am out on the platform, through the door of the
station and aboard the one-horse tram that wiggles and swings over the
cobble-scoured streets of Dordrecht, and so on to the Bellevue.

Why I stop at the Bellevue (apart from it being one of my Inns) is that
from its windows I cannot only watch the life of the tawny-colored,
boat-crowded Maas, but see every curl of smoke that mounts from the
chimneys of Papendrecht strung along its opposite bank. My dear friend,
Herr Boudier, of years gone by, has retired from its ownership, but
his successor, Herr Teitsma, is as hearty in his welcome. Peter, my old
boatman, too, pulled his last oar some two years back, and one "Bop"
takes his place. There is another "p" and an "e" tacked on to Bop, but I
have eliminated the unnecessary and call him "Bob" for short. They
made Bob out of what was left of Peter, but they left out all trace of
William.

This wooden-shod curiosity is anywhere from seventy to one hundred and
fifty years old, gray, knock-kneed, bent in the back, and goes to sleep
standing up--_and stays asleep_. He is the exact duplicate of the
tramp in the comic opera of "Miss Hook of Holland"--except that the
actor-sleeper occasionally topples over and has to be braced up. Bob is
past-master of the art and goes it alone, without propping of any kind.
He is the only man in Dordrecht, or Papendrecht, or the country round
about, who can pull a boat and speak English. He says so, and I am
forced not only to believe him, but to hire him. He wants it in advance,
too--having had some experience with "painter-man," he explains to Herr
Teitsma.

I shall, of course, miss my delightful William, but I am accustomed to
that. And, then, again, while Bob asleep is an interesting physiological
study, Bob awake adds to the gayety of nations, samples of which crowd
about my easel, Holland being one of the main highways of the earth.

I have known Dort and the little 'drecht across the way for some fifteen
years, five of which have slipped by since I last opened my umbrella
along its quaint quays. To my great joy nothing has changed. The old
potato boat still lies close to the quay, under the overhanging elms.
The same dear old man and his equally dear old wife still make their
home beneath its hipped roof. I know, for it is here I lunch, the cargo
forming the chief dish, followed by a saucer of stewed currants, a cup
of coffee--(more hymns here)--and a loaf of bread from the baker's. The
old Groote Kirk still towers aloft--the highest building in Holland,
they say; the lazy, red-sailed luggers drift up and down, their decks
gay with potted plants; swiss curtains at the cabin windows, the wife
holding the tiller while the man trims the sail. The boys still clatter
over the polished cobbles--an aggressive mob when school lets out--and a
larger crop, I think, than in the years gone by, and with more noise--my
umbrella being the target. Often a spoilt fish or half a last week's
cabbage comes my way, whereupon Bob awakes to instant action with a
consequent scattering, the bravest and most agile making faces from
behind wharf spiles and corners. Peter used to build a fence of oars
around me to keep them off, but Bob takes it out in swearing.

Only once did he silence them. They were full grown, this squad, and had
crowded the old man against a tree under which I had backed as shelter
from a passing shower. There came a blow straight from the shoulder, a
sprawling boy, and Bob was in the midst of them, his right sleeve rolled
up, showing a full-rigged ship tattooed in India ink. What poured from
him I learned afterward was an account of his many voyages to the Arctic
and around the Horn, as the label on his arm proved--an experience
which, he shouted, would be utilized in pounding them up into fish bait
if they did not take to their heels. After that he always went to sleep
with one eye open, the boys keeping awake with two--and out of my way--a
result which interested me the more.

If my Luigi was not growing restless in my beloved Venice (it is
wonderful how large a portion of the earth I own) I would love to pass
the rest of my summer along these gray canals, especially since Bob's
development brings a daily surprise. Only to-day I caught sight of him
half hidden in an angle of a wall, surrounded by a group of little tots
who were begging him for paper pin-wheels which a vender had stopped to
sell, an infinitesimal small coin the size of a cuff button purchasing
a dozen or more. When I again looked up from a canvas each tot had a
pin-wheel, and later on Bob, that much poorer in pocket, sneaked back
and promptly went to sleep.

But even Bob's future beatification cannot hold me. I yearn for the
white, blinding light and breathless lagoons, and all that makes Venice
the Queen City of the World.

Luigi meets me _inside_ the station. It takes a _soldo_ to get in, and
Luigi has but few of them, but he is always there. His gondola is
moored to the landing steps outside--a black swan of a boat, all morocco
cushions and silk fringes; the product of a thousand years of tinkering
by the most fastidious and luxurious people of ancient or modern times,
and still to-day the most comfortable conveyance known to man.'

Hurry up, you who have never known a gondola or a Luigi! A
vile-smelling, chuggity-chug is forcing its way up every crooked canal,
no matter how narrow. Two Venetian shipyards are hammering away on their
hulls or polishing their motors. Soon the cost of production will drop
to that of a gondola. Then look out! There are eight thousand machinists
in the Arsenal earning but five francs a day, any one of whom can learn
to run a motor boat in a week, thus doubling their wages. Worse yet--the
world is getting keener every hour for speedy things. I may be wrong--I
hope and pray I am--but it seems to me that the handwriting is already
on the wall. "This way to the Museo Civico," it reads--"if you want
to find a gondola of twenty-five years ago." As for the Luigis and the
Esperos--they will then have given up the unequal struggle.

The only hope rests with the Venetians themselves. They have restored
the scarred Library, and are rebuilding the Campanile, with a reverence
for the things which made their past glorious that commands the respect
of the artistic world. The gondola is as much a part of Venice as its
sunsets, pigeons, and palaces. Let them by special license keep the
Tragfaetti intact, with their shuttles of gondolas crossing bade and
forth--then, perhaps, the catastrophe may be deferred for a few decades.

*****

As it was in Dort and Papendrecht so it is in Venice. Except these
beastly, vile-smelling boats there is nothing new, thank God. Everything
else is faded, weather-worn, and old, everything filled with sensuous
beauty--sky, earth, lagoon, garden wall, murmuring ripples--the same
wonderful Venice that thrills its lovers the world over.

And the old painters are still here--Walter Brown, Bunce, Bompard,
Faulkner, and the rest--successors of Ziem and Rico--men who have loved
her all their lives. And with them a new band of devotees--Monet
and Louis Aston Knight among them. "For a few days," they said in
explanation, but it was weeks before they left--only to return, I
predict, as Jong as they can hold a brush.

As for Luigi and me--we keep on our accustomed way, leading our
accustomed lives. Seventeen years now since he bent to his oar behind my
cushions--twenty-six in all since I began to idle about her canals. It
is either the little canal next the Public Garden, or up the Giudecca,
or under the bronze horses of San Marco; or it may be we are camped out
in the Piazzetta before the Porta della Carta; or perhaps up the narrow
canal of San Rocco, or in the Fruit Market near the Rialto while the
boats unload their cargoes.

All old subjects and yet ever new; each has been painted a thousand
times, and in as many different lights and perspectives. And yet each
canvas differs from its fellows as do two ripples or two morning skies.

For weeks we drift about. One day Carlotta, the fishwife up the
Fondamenta della Pallada, makes us our coffee; the next Luigi buys it
of some smart cafe on the Piazza. This with a roll, a bit of Gorgonzola,
and a bunch of grapes, or half a dozen figs, is our luncheon, to which
is added two curls of blue smoke, one from Luigi's pipe and the other
from my cigarette. Then we fall to work again.

But this will never do! While I have been loafing with Luigi not only
has the summer slipped away, but the cool winds of October have crept
down from the Alps. There are fresh subjects to tackle--some I have
never seen. Athens beckons to me. The columns of the Parthenon loom up!

*****

If there are half a dozen ways of getting into Papendrecht--there is
only one of reaching Athens--that is, if you start from Venice. Trieste
first, either by rail or boat, and then aboard one of the Austrian
Lloyds, and so on down the Adriatic to Patras.

It is October, remember--when every spear of grass from a six months'
drought--the customary dry spell--is burnt to a crisp. It will rain
to-morrow, or next week, they will tell you--but it doesn't--never has
in October--and never will. Strange to say, you never miss it--neither
in the color of the mountains flanking the Adriatic or in any of the
ports on the way down, or in Patras itself. The green note to which I
have been accustomed--which I have labored over all my life--is lacking,
and a new palette takes its place--of mauve, violet, indescribable
blues, and evanescent soap-bubble reds. The slopes of the hills are
mother-of-pearl, their tops melting into cloud shadows so delicate in
tone that you cannot distinguish where one leaves off and the other
begins.

And it is so in Patras, except for a riotous, defiant pine--green as a
spring cabbage or a newly painted shutter--that sucks its moisture from
nobody knows where--hasn't any, perhaps, and glories in its shame. All
along the railroad from the harbor of Patras to the outskirts of Athens
it is the same--bare fields, bare hills, streets and roads choked with
dust. And so, too, when you arrive at the station and take the omnibus
for the Grand Bretagne.

By this time you are accustomed to it--in fact you rather enjoy it.
If you have a doubt of it, step out on the balcony at the front of the
hotel and look up!

Hanging in the sky--in an air of pure ether, set in films of silver
grays in which shimmer millions of tones, delicate as the shadings of
a pearl, towers the Acropolis, its crest fringed by the ruins of the
greatest temples the world possesses.

I rang a bell.

"Get me a carriage and send me up a guide--anybody who can speak English
and who is big enough to carry a sketch trap."

He must have been outside, so quickly did he answer the call. He was
two-thirds the size of William, one-half the length of Luigi, and
one-third the age of Bob.

"What is your name?"

"Vlassopoulos."

"Anything else?"

"Yes--Panis."

"Then we'll drop the last half. Put those traps in the carriage--and
take me to the Parthenon."

I never left it for fourteen consecutive days--nor did I see a square
inch of Athens other than the streets I drove through up and back on my
way to work. Nor have I in all my experience ever had a more competent,
obliging, and companionable guide--always excepting my beloved Luigi,
who is not only my guide, but my protector and friend as well.

It was then that I blessed the dust. Green things, wet things, soggy
things--such as mud and dull skies--have no place in the scheme of the
Parthenon and its contiguous temples and ruins. That wonderful tea-rose
marble, with its stains of burnt sienna marking the flutings of endless
broken columns, needs no varnishing of moisture to enhance its beauty.
That will do for the facade of Burlington House with its grimy gray
statues, or the moss-encrusted tower of the Groote Kirk, but never here.
It was this fear, perhaps, that kept me at work, haunted as I was by the
bogy of "Rain to-morrow. It always comes, and keeps on for a month when
it starts in." Blessed be the weather clerk! It never started in--not
until I reached Brindisi on my way back to Paris; then, if I remember,
there was some falling weather--at the rate of two inches an hour.

And yet I might as well confess that my fourteen days of consecutive
study of the Acropolis, beginning at the recently uncovered entrance
gate and ending in the Museum behind the Parthenon, added nothing to my
previous historical or other knowledge--meagre as it had been.

Where the Venetians wrought the greatest havoc, how many and what
columns were thrown down; how high and thick and massive they were; what
parts of the marvellous ruin that High Robber Chief Lord Elgin stole
and carted off to London, and still keeps the British Museum acting as
"fence"; how wide and long and spacious was the superb chamber that held
the statue the gods loved--none of these things interested me--do not
now. What I saw was an epoch in stone; a chronicle telling the story
of civilization; a glove thrown down to posterity, challenging the
competition of the world.

And with this came a feeling of reverence so profound, so awe-inspiring,
so humbling, that I caught myself speaking to Panis in whispers--as one
does in a temple when the service is in progress. This, as the sun sped
its course and the purple shadows of the coming night began to creep up
the steps and columns of the marvellous pile, its pediment bathed in the
rose-glow of the fading day, was followed by a silence that neither of
us cared to break. For then the wondrous temple took on the semblance
of some old sage, the sunlight on his forehead, the shadow of the future
about his knees.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
