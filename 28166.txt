INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

CUSTOM MARK III

CP SERIES OIL FIRED UNIT


_GENERAL_

The Custom Mark III CP Series Oil Fired Unit is a high quality heating
unit that will provide many years of comfortable and economical heat if
properly installed and given proper care. It is _IMPORTANT_ therefore that
these instructions should be followed carefully.


_SHIPMENT_

The unit is completely assembled at the factory except for the following
parts which are packed in a separate carton and strapped to the skids
inside the shipping carton:

    1 - 3/4" x Close Steel Nipple
    1 - 3/4" x 3/4" x 1/2" Tee
    1 - Fig. 105 Tridicator
    1 - 3/4" No. 10-402-05 ASME Relief Valve
    1 - 3/4" No. 600-19 Boiler Drain
    1 - T87F-2055 Thermostat

The jacket extension for 128CPO is shipped in separate carton.


_DAMAGE IN TRANSIT_

Upon receipt of shipment of this material, inspect all cartons for
external damage. If external damage is noted, open the carton and
inspect for damage to equipment. Mark the number of cartons received in
this condition on the delivering carrier's waybill, and request the
services of their inspector.

If, upon opening a carton, concealed damage is discovered, open the
entire shipment and note all equipment so damaged. Contact the
delivering carrier and request inspection of the damaged equipment. Do
not destroy the carton. The inspector from the freight company will need
this to determine reason for damage.

Normally claims for any and all damages should be filed with the freight
company within five working days after receipt of shipment.

All materials are sold F.O.B. Factory. It is the responsibility of the
consignee to file claim with the delivering carrier for material
received in a damaged condition.


_LOCATING UNIT_

_BEFORE REMOVING SHIPPING CARTON, LOCATE UNIT IN ITS FINAL POSITION_

The carton is plainly marked so as to indicate which is the outlet
burner end of the unit which is also the end where the return and flue
are located. Clearance should be provided in both the front and rear of
the unit for cleaning. Where possible it is good practice to locate the
unit so its sides are parallel to the chimney flue. In all instances
locate unit as near chimney flue as possible in order to avoid use of a
long flue pipe.


_REMOVING CARTON_

Once the packaged unit is in its proper place, cut all around the carton
on the scored line as shown on carton. The entire carton may then be
lifted from the skids.

If it is found necessary to move the unit a little more to place it in
the exact location ready for piping, do so before removing skids.

DO NOT PUSH AGAINST ANY PART OF JACKET OR OIL BURNER WHEN MOVING UNIT.
TO MOVE UNIT, PUSH AGAINST _SKIDS, FLUE BOX OR SMOKE BOX_. PUSHING AGAINST
JACKET WILL RESULT IN DAMAGE.


_REMOVING SKIDS_

The skids are specially designed for easy removal. It is necessary,
however, to follow these instructions carefully.

     A. After unit is in proper place, remove the two cross
        pieces from skids by pulling out all scaffolding (double
        headed) nails.

     B. By inserting pinch bar or 2" x 4" underneath the smoke
        box (rear of unit), tilt one side of unit just high enough
        to lift lugs out of holes in skid, then knock skid out
        from underneath unit. Then do the same thing on the other
        side of unit. _THE UNIT IS NOT BOLTED TO THE SKIDS._ The
        3/4" lugs welded to the unit simply fit into the 3/4"
        holes in the skids.

|                                              |
|  DO NOT TILT UNIT BY PUSHING AGAINST JACKET  |
|                                              |
|            IT IS NOT NECESSARY               |
|                                              |
|  AND BY DOING SO THE JACKET WILL BE DAMAGED  |
|                                              |
+----------------------------------------------+


_LEVELING UNIT_

In case floor is uneven, unit may easily be made level by inserting
shims under the 4 shipping lugs. These lugs also keep the jacket 1/2"
off the floor, protecting it from wet floors and dampness.


_PIPING AND WIRING_

Once the unit is in its proper location with the packing carton, skids
and packing material removed, it is ready for piping and connection from
Room Thermostat and 110 V. 60 Cy. A.C. Current.


_CONTROL SYSTEM_

The controls furnished are for a one zone Forced Water System consisting
of T87F Room Thermostat, L8124A-1007 Triple Acting Aquastat and
Circulator Relay, C554A-1018 Cadmium Photocell, R8184G-1005 Burner
Relay and V4046A-1009 Oil Valve. Description and complete wiring diagram
will be found packed with each control.


_SPECIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS_

For special control systems such as multiple installations, zone
controlled, unit heater, radiant panel, etc., write to factory for
wiring diagrams.


_CHIMNEY AND BREECHING REQUIREMENTS_

The CP boiler should be connected to a vertical vent system that will
prevent: (1) positive pressure in the flue, (2) backward flow of flue
gas through the unit when the burner stops, and (3) condensation in the
flue.

Use double-walled or insulated pipe for sections of the flue in cold
areas. All outside vents, except for short extensions, must be insulated
to avoid condensation in the flue. Several types of prefabricated
chimneys are available providing double-walled or insulated pipe, some
with ceramic and others with metallic liners.

While the unit is equipped with an induced draft fan, proper size vent
must be provided to remove the gases of combustion. It is recommended
that a 4" to 5" increaser be used for venting the 87CPO and 108CPO and a
4" to 6" increaser be used for the 128CPO. For abnormal runs (exceeding
10 ft.), consult factory.

Vent and breeching must be gas tight by sealing with asbestos or
thermo-setting pressure sensitive tape.


_DRAFT REGULATOR_

It is recommended that a draft regulator be installed in chimney flue
_just below the flue pipe opening_, if the unit is attached to an
extremely high chimney; an unlined chimney; or a chimney which is
constructed on the exterior of the house.


_CONTROLS AND TRIM_

Controls are installed in place at the Factory. Attach thermo-altimeter
in 1/2" tapping in top front of boiler. Install 3/4" x close nipple in
3/4" top connection with 3/4" x 3/4" x 1/2" Tee. 3/4" Tee opening for
installation of the relief valve and 1/2" opening for expansion tank.


_WIRING_

Controls are all in place and wired at the factory except connection to
circulator.


_REGULATING OIL PRESSURE_

Standard nozzles furnished with the burner will produce the stamped
rated capacity when used with Commercial Standard No. 2 Fuel Oil, and
operated with a pressure of 100 lbs. per square inch. The standard
setting of the fuel unit is 100 lbs. Due to difference in tank
elevations, the pressure should be adjusted at the time of start up.


_FUEL LINES_

Care should be employed when attaching the oil lines to the fuel unit.
Overtightening or twisting will twist the pump-motor mounting plate and
put a stress on the motor bearings.


_START UP PROCEDURE_

General:

     1. Make certain that correct voltage has been supplied to
        motor and control circuit.

     2. Insure that outside air openings are provided in the
        boiler room for ventilation, and for admission of air
        for combustion. The free area of such openings should
        not be less than 7 square inch opening per 100,000 Btuh
        burner input, or more as required by local codes.

     3. Check to see that flue, wiring and water level are in
        order.

     4. Start burner fan motor to prime pump. If pump does not
        pick up oil within a few minutes, prime the pump with
        lubricating oil. Do not allow pump to run more than a
        few minutes without additional lubrication.

     5. Check oil pressure and adjust if necessary. (See
        REGULATING OIL PRESSURE).

     6. Set air shutters. (See ADJUSTING BURNER) Refer to Figure 1.

     7. Generously lubricate the front motor bearing with SAE #20
        oil.


_ADJUSTING BURNER_ (See Figure 1)

Positioning of the nozzle in relation to the face of the cone and the
electrodes in relation to the nozzle are very important, also the face
of the cone in relation to the face of the choke ring must be set
according to the chart for each rate.

If the air shutter openings are too large the oil may not ignite.

     1. This setting will vary somewhat depending upon the grade
        of oil being used or if No. 1 is used instead of No. 2.

     2. The approximate burner air setting may be determined by
        observing the fire through the observation port on the
        front of the boiler. If the flame is smoky, the air shutter
        should be opened until the fire burns clean, without any
        trace of smoke. The flame should be bright yellow in color
        with the tips of the flame turning orange. If the flame is
        too white, reduce the amount of air admitted; and, if too
        red or smoky increase the air.

     3. Final adjustments should be made using a flue gas
        analyzer to measure the CO_2 content of the flue gas and
        a Bacharach model smoke meter or equivalent to determine
        the amount of smoke (not to exceed a "TRACE").

        For checking efficiency only the stack temperature and
        CO_2 may be taken immediately after the fan and refer to
        the standard efficiency charts for the results. Readings
        of 5 to 8% taken after the fan correspond to 10 to 12%
        taken in the rear uptake of the boiler.

        The reduction in CO_2 reading in the flue is caused by
        the air being drawn in around the motor shaft for cooling
        purposes. The motor cooling air is at ambient temperature
        and, therefore, does not add energy to or subtract energy
        from the flue gas analysis, it only adds volume to the flue
        gas. Therefore, applying this data to standard efficiency
        charts will give a true indication of flue gas loss.

|                                             |
|  Final adjustment should be made after      |
|  the burner has been firing continuously    |
|  for at least 10 minutes, as the fan pulls  |
|  less air when the flue gases are hot.      |

A. CHECK LIMIT CONTROL

Run the burner long enough to bring the water temperature up to at least
190 degrees then turn the limit control setting until the burner stops.

|  boiler should be 140 degrees F. in order to      |
|  prevent corrosion of the flues on the fire       |
|  side. The burner should be run with the primary  |
|  control thermostat terminals jumpered and the    |
|  burner controlled directly from an aquastat      |
|  keeping the boiler hot all the time, thus        |
|  eliminating the sweating of the flues on the     |
|  fire side caused by starting from a cold start.  |
|                                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------+


_BELT ADJUSTMENT_

The proper tension on the fuel unit belt drive is set at the factory.
However, the belt should be checked periodically to see that the setting
is maintained. To check setting, first, remove the belt guard and then,
using fingers, compress the belt at a point midway between the sheaves.
The proper setting at this point measured between the outer edges of the
belt, should be between 1-3/4" and 1-7/8". If adjustment is necessary
loosen the two mounting bolts, and move the fuel unit up or down to give
the necessary belt setting. Then re-tighten the mounting bolts securely
and replace the belt guard.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
