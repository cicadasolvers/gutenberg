            A ROUND ROBIN
                 TO
            J. M. BARRIE

From His Humble and Devoted Servants
            THE ALPHABET


The Lord forgive if we transgress
Thus to familiarly address
  One of our betters.
But Jamie, do you no recall
The slate whereon you learned to scrawl
  Your Humble Letters?

Well we remember how you drew
Our shapely features all askew,
  Unflattering really.
You made A lame and B too fat
And C too curly--what of that!
  We loved you dearly.

From that first day we owned your spell,
And just because you used us well
  We served you blindly.
Why, even when you put us through
A fearsome Scottish Reel, we knew
  You meant it kindly.

Jamie, 'tis said Grand Tales there be
Still biding in the A B C--
  If this be true,
Quick Jamie! Cast your golden net.
Maybe we have the grandest yet
  In store for you.




[Illustration: A]

_A is for Adams_


So A is for Adams, Oh! fortunate A
Luck certainly seems to be coming your way.
In the Days of my Infancy, A I recall
Stood for Ant or for Apple or anything small.
Now A stands for Adams, Maude Adams, Hurray!
I always _said_ A would be Famous some day.




[Illustration: B]

_B stands for the Boys_


B's for the Boys, all as Busy as Bees
They are building a Little House under the Trees
With funny red walls and mossy green roof
Where Wendy may live from danger aloof.




[Illustration: C]

_C is the Crocodile_


C is the Crocodile Creepy who ate
The right hand of Hook and covets its mate
He makes a loud ticking wherever he goes
For he swallowed a Clock (To kill time I suppose).




[Illustration: D]

_D is for DoodleDoo_


D is the Dire and Dread DoodleDoo
With which Peter Daunted the Pirate crew,
And demolished a foolish old Proverb for good
By crowing before he was out of the wood.




[Illustration: E]

_E is the Exit_


E is the Exit the three children made
With Peter and Tinker for guides, Who's afraid?
They sailed through the window as calm as could be
Like three little Cherubim out for a Spree.




[Illustration: F]

_F is the Fight_


F is the Fight, Peter Fought unafraid
And F is his Falchion (Poetic for Blade)
And F's the Fine Feeling all Fearless Boys Feel
When they give a Fierce Pirate a taste of Cold Steel.




[Illustration: G]

_G is Old Glory_


G is Old Glory--that Peter upreared,
When Hook in the Crocodile's smile disappeared,
And the Decks were still wet with the terrible stains
Of _Invisible Gore_ from the Pirate's veins.




[Illustration: H]

_H stands for Hook_


I'm sorry for H, tho' I don't call Hook mean
For wanting to Blow Up his own Magazine.
I've known a Good Author blow up, in a Huff,
A Magazine just for not printing his Stuff.




[Illustration: I]

_I's for the Indian Girl_


Peter Pan was too coy for the Indian Miss;
She sighed for his scalp--all she got was a kiss.




[Illustration: J]

_J is for John_


J is for John (No, he hasn't a Pain;
He is Red-Handed Jack of the Pirate Main).




[Illustration: K]

_K stands for a Kiss_


K stands for a Kiss? Oh, stern featured K!
Who would have suspected--_You'd_ leanings that way!
Peter called _his_ a Thimble--(_I_ think it sounds tame
To call Kisses Thimbles--but what's in a Name!)




[Illustration: L]

_L is the Lion_


L is the Lion who lashed his Fierce Tail,
And did Peter Tremble? did Peter turn Pale?
Not Much! 'Twas the Lion who moved to adjourn,
He couldn't turn Tail, Peter left none to Turn.




[Illustration: M]

_M is for Michael_


M is for Michael--ssssh!--whisper it low!
In Pirate Circles he's called Blackbeard Joe!




[Illustration: N]

_N is for Napoleon and Nana_


N is Napoleon--Mystic--Profound
And N is for Nana the Noble Nurse Hound--
Two wonderful natures--each great in his way,
One's dead and the other is "Having his Day."




[Illustration: O]

_O's for Odds-fish!!_


O's for Odds-fish--the Pirate's Oath.
To print such a word, Gentle Reader, I'm loth.
And should _You_ be guilty of language so low,
I should have to stop calling you "Gentle," you know.




[Illustration: P]

_P is for Peter_


P is for Peter, and so are we all,
May he ever keep young and his Shadow stay Small.
Yet I think 'tis a pity the White House is Bann'd.
As President, Peter would simply be Grand!




[Illustration: Q]

_Q is the Quiver_


Q is the Quiver from which Tootles drew
The Arrow that nearly pierced poor Wendy through.
'Twas Peter's _Kiss Button_ that stopped it--Ah me!
If Kisses _were_ Buttons--how _safe_ they would be!




[Illustration: R]

_R's for the Redskins_


R's for the Redskins, who Guarded the Cave.
What a Treat to see "Injuns" sit up and Behave!




[Illustration: S]

_S is the Shadow_


S is the Shadow--tho' not of much use,
You'd surely be Sorry if _Yours_ Should get loose.
So See to your Shadow--be sure it's on tight,
When Peter lost _his_ he was in a sad plight.




[Illustration: T]

_T is for Tinker Bell_


Poor Tinker Bell's dying, Quick! say you Believe
In Fairies, that Tinker New Life may receive.




[Illustration: U]

_U is the Underground Home_


U's the underground home mid the roots of the trees,
Where when not slaying Pirates, the boys take their ease.
While Wendy sits mending their shirtwaists and hose,
And the Redskins above Keep watch against foes.




[Illustration: V]

_V is the Verse_


V's the Vile Verse that the Pirate Bawled--
It was not his language so much that appalled,
Nor the Tune--nor his Voice which was Raucus and Deep
'Twas _the way that he sang it_ That made your flesh creep.




[Illustration: W]

_W's Wolves_


W's wolves--'Tis said they will fly
If you look through your legs at them straight in the eye.
That's how the Boys did it, but if I were you,
I'd experiment first on a wolf in the Zoo.




[Illustration: X]

_X is the X Ray_


X is the X Ray by whose light alone,
This last fleeting picture of Hook may be shown.




[Illustration: Y]

_Y is for Youth_


Y is for _Youth_ to which Peter clung,
But where is the land where he learned to Stay Young?
Ask Peter, he'll tell you, Geography scorning,
"Second Turn to the Right and keep straight on till Morning."




[Illustration: Z]

_Z is the Zebra_


Z is the Zebra the Boys _didn't_ meet,
But without which no Alphabet's really complete.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
