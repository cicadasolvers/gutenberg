New Subspecies of the Rodent Baiomys From Central America

BY

ROBERT L. PACKARD


The southern pygmy mouse, _Baiomys musculus_, is known as far north as
the Mexican states of Jalisco, Michoacan, south of the Mesa Central,
east to central Veracruz (see Hooper, 1952a:90), and south to western
Nicaragua (see Goodwin, 1942:161). Previously, two subspecies have been
recognized from the southern part of the known range of this species:
_B. m. nigrescens_, blackish mice from Chiapas, Mexico, and Guatemala,
and _B. m. grisescens_, grayish-brown mice from Honduras and western
Nicaragua. Study of recently acquired specimens from Guatemala, El
Salvador, and Nicaragua reveals two additional subspecies.

For the loan of comparative material, I am grateful to the United States
National Museum (USNM) and the American Museum of Natural History
(AMNH). Unless otherwise indicated, specimens are in the University of
Kansas Museum of Natural History. Measurements are as taken by Hooper
(1952b:10). Postpalatal length is the distance from the posterior margin
of the hard palate to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. Unless
otherwise noted, statistical significance as used in this paper is at
the 95 per cent confidence limit or higher.

The two heretofore undescribed subspecies are characterized below and
may be known as:


=_Baiomys musculus handleyi_=, new subspecies

     _Type._--Adult female, USNM No. 275604 (Biological Surveys
     Collection), skin and skull; from Sacapulas, El Quiche, Guatemala;
     obtained on April 24, 1947, by Charles O. Handley, Jr., original
     number 991.

     _Distribution._--Known only from the type locality; probably
     inhabits parts of the east-west drainage of the Rio Negro.

     _Diagnosis._--General ground color of upper parts between Wood
     Brown and Buffy Brown (all capitalized color terms are those of
     Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,
     1912), dorsal parts of fore- and hind-feet, and ankles white; in
     region of median venter, throat, and chin, hairs white to base; in
     lateral regions hairs Neutral Gray at base; dorsal hairs below tips
     Avellaneous, Neutral Gray at base; guard hairs black-tipped; tail
     white below, brownish above; nasals truncate anteriorly;
     frontalparietal suture forming an obtuse angle with median-parietal
     suture; alveolar-length of upper molar tooth-row and tail long.

     _Comparisons._--From _Baiomys musculus nigrescens_ (paratypes, from
     the Valley of Comitan, Chiapas, Mexico), found to the north, _B. m.
     handleyi_ differs in: color paler dorsally and ventrally; fore- and
     hind-feet whitish instead of dusky to sooty; hairs in region of
     facial vibrissae white instead of brown; tail bicolored instead of
     unicolored; anterior tips of nasals square, not rounded;
     frontoparietal suture forming obtuse angle with median parietal
     suture instead of a right angle; tail and alveolar length of upper
     molar tooth-row significantly larger (see table 1); zygomatic
     breadth, breadth of braincase, occipitonasal length, least
     interorbital constriction, and length of rostrum all averaging
     larger (see table 2).

     From _Baiomys musculus grisescens_ (paratypes, from Comayabuela,
     Honduras) to the south, _B. m. handleyi_ differs in: buff-colored
     hairs in dorsal and ventral region lacking; fore- and hind-feet
     white, not flesh-colored with gray overtones; tail bicolored, not
     unicolored; face paler, lacking buff-brown coloration; anterior
     tips of nasals squared rather than flaring; tail and upper molar
     tooth-row significantly longer (see Table 1); hind foot, ear from
     notch, and rostrum longer; braincase averaging broader (see Table
     2).

_Remarks._--The occurrence of these pale mice in the Rio Negro Valley
was first noted by Goodwin (1934:39, 40) when he referred specimens from
Sacapulas and Chanquejelve, Guatemala, to _B. m. musculus_. Hooper (_op.
cit._:92-94) correctly assigned specimens from the southern coast and
eastern part of Chiapas to _B. m. nigrescens_. The continued assignment
of specimens from Sacapulas, Guatemala, to the subspecies _musculus_
produces a hiatus both in the range of _B. m. nigrescens_ and _B. m.
musculus_. Twenty-four specimens, 14 from 1 mi. S Rabinal, and 10 from
1/2 mi. N, 1 mi. E Salama, Guatemala, are intergrades between _handleyi_
and _grisescens_, but show more resemblance to the latter and,
therefore, are referred to that subspecies. To the north, _handleyi_
intergrades with _nigrescens_. The specimen from Chanquejelve is an
intergrade between the two subspecies just mentioned.

Osgood suggested (1909:259) that the degree of relative humidity might
in some way control color of pelage in this species. Relative humidity
and its subsequent effect on other related environmental factors indeed
may account for the superficial resemblance of _B. m. musculus_ to _B.
m. handleyi_ (although _handleyi_ averages paler throughout than the
paratypical series of _musculus_). Both subspecies inhabit relatively
arid country. According to Goodwin (_op. cit._:39 and Plate 5, Fig. 1),
and Handley (_in verbis_), the Rio Negro Valley in the vicinity of
Sacapulas is extremely hot, dry, and rather isolated. Extremes of
climate there may exceed those in the arid habitat occupied by _B. m.
musculus_. The resemblance between these two subspecies may result from
nearly parallel selective forces that have given rise to two distinct
subspecies. _B. m. handleyi_ may have developed _in situ_.

     _Specimens examined._--Total 49, from the type locality, including
     the type (12, USNM; 37, AMNH).


=_Baiomys musculus pullus_=, new subspecies

     _Type._--Adult female, skin and skull, University of Kansas Museum
     of Natural History, No. 71605, from 8 mi. S Condega, Esteli,
     Nicaragua; obtained on July 15, 1956, by A. A. Alcorn, original No.
     4218.

     _Distribution._--West-central Nicaragua, from Matagalpa northwest
     into the valley of the Rio Esteli, east as far as Jinotega.

     _Diagnosis._--Dorsum Fuscus-Black (see remarks),
     individual dorsal hairs being black-tipped with a subterminal
     Ochraceous-Buff band, Neutral Gray at base; some hairs on dorsum
     all black to Neutral Gray at base; hair on sides Neutral Gray
     tinged with blackish; facial region blackish becoming more buffy
     ventrally; vibrissae black; tail unicolored Chaetura Black; fore-
     and hind-feet whitish to dusky-white; mid-ventral region of belly
     white to as far anteriorly as region of throat, hairs being white
     to base; in region of anus and throat, hairs white-tipped, Neutral
     Gray at base; tail long; upper molar tooth-row short as in _B. m.
     nigrescens_; zygoma bowed as in _B. m. grisescens_.

     _Comparisons._--From _B. m. grisescens_ (paratypes from
     Comayaguela, Honduras), _B. m. pullus_ differs in: dorsal
     ground-color and tail darker; sides and distal region of belly
     grayish instead of buffy-brown, thus making white stripe in region
     of belly distinct; average length of body and tail significantly
     longer, thus, total length greater; length of hind foot averaging
     longer (68 per cent confidence limits); alveolar length of upper
     molar tooth-row significantly shorter; occipitonasal and rostral
     length averaging longer; zygomatic spread and interorbital region
     narrower; length of incisive foramina, depth of cranium,
     postpalatal length, and breadth of braincase all averaging larger
     (see table 2).

     From _B. m. nigrescens_ (paratypes from Valley of Comitan), _B. m.
     pullus_ differs in: dorsal ground-color slightly darker; facial
     region grayish, not sooty; mid-ventral white stripe present on
     belly and becoming grayish laterally; tail darker and less hairy,
     average length significantly longer; body, occipitonasal length of
     skull, incisive foramina, and postpalatal length averaging smaller;
     hind foot shorter; zygomatic spread, interorbital region and
     braincase broader (see table of measurements); cranium deeper.

_Remarks._--_B. m. pullus_ is the darkest dorsally of any subspecies of
this species. Dalquest (1953:156) pointed out that preserved specimens
of one of the subspecies of the northern pygmy mouse, _Baiomys taylori
taylori_, tended to fade considerably over a period of four years.
Post-mortem changes in color also are apparent in the southern species
_musculus_. For example, the series of specimens from 8 mi. S of
Condega, and 9 mi. NNW Esteli, Nicaragua, have faded from near Chaetura
Black to the present Fuscous-Black in a period of two years. The most
notable change in color came after the first six months of preservation.
Allowing for this fading, the several color differences between
_pullus_, _nigrescens_ and _grisescens_ are, nevertheless, distinctive.

Geographically, _pullus_ is partly isolated by the Cerros De Villaguaire
and the Cerros El Zapotillo to the west and the Cerros De
Azaculapa to the north. Certain individuals of a series of specimens,
referable to _B. m. nigrescens_, from 1 mi. NW San Salvador
and 1 mi. S Los Planes, El Salvador, are intermediate in coloration
between that subspecies and _pullus_. Three of 28 specimens
from El Salvador possess the mid-ventral white stripe.

Albert Alcorn wrote in his itinerary that some of the type series
were taken shortly after lunch (I assume this would mean near
noon) near a small creek, and that the specimens from 9 mi. NNW
Esteli were trapped in wood piles and rock piles about dusk.

_Specimens examined._--Total (all from Nicaragua) 36 as follows: Esteli:
type locality, 22 (including the type); 8 mi. NNW Esteli, 3; 9 mi. NNW
Esteli, 8. Jinotega: 1 mi. NW Jinotega, 1; San Rafael Del Norte, 1 AMNH.
Matagalpa: Matagalpa, 1 AMNH.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
