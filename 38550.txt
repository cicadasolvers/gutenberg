PREFACE.


In our Essay and Notes in the present Volume we so fully state such
things as it seemed expedient to state on the specialties of our
collection of Crashaw's Latin and Greek Poetry, in common with our like
collection of his English Poetry in Vol. I., that little remains for
preface here, beyond our wish renewedly to express our gratitude and
obligations to our fellow-workers on the Translations now submitted. The
names given at p. 4 herein, and the markings on the margin of the
Contents, will show how generously my own somewhat large proportion of
the task of love has been lightened by them; and throughout I have been
aided and animated by the cordiality with which the friends have
responded to my demands, or spontaneously sent their contributions.
Preeminently I owe thanks to my 'brother beloved,' the Rev. RICHARD
WILTON, M.A., Londesborough Rectory, Market Weighton.

On the text of the Latin and Greek I refer to the close of our Essay;
but I must acknowledge willing and scholarly help, on certain points
whereon I consulted them, from Rev. Dr. HOLDEN, Ipswich, Rev. Dr.
JESSOPP, Norwich, and W. ALDIS WRIGHT, Esq. M.A. Cambridge (as before);
albeit the inevitable variety of suggested emendations, as onward,
compelled me to limit myself to as accurate a reproduction as possible
of the text of Crashaw himself, obvious misprints excepted.

I have now to record the various University Collections wherein
Crashaw's earliest poetical efforts appeared--all showing a passionate
loyalty, which indeed remained with him to the end.

(_a_) Anthologia in Regis exanthemata; seu gratulatio Musarum
Cantabrigiensium de felicissime conservata Regis Caroli valetudine,
1632.

(_b_) Ducis Eboracensis Fasciae a Musis Cantabrigiensibus raptim
contextae, 1633.

(_c_) Rex Redux; sive Musa Cantabrigiensis Voti ... et felici reditu
Regis Caroli post receptam coronam comitaque peracta in Scotia, 1633.

(_d_) Carmen Natalitium ad cunas illustrissimae Principis Elizabethae
decantatum intra Nativitatis Dom. solemnia per humiles Cantabrigiae
Musas, 1635.

(_e_) {Synodia}, sive Musarum Cantabrigiensium concentus et
congratulatio ad serenissimum Britanniarum Regem Carolum de quinta sua
sobole clarissima Principe sibi nuper felicissime nata, 1637.

(_f_) Voces votivae ab Academicis Cantabrigiensibus pro novissimo Caroli
et Mariae Principe Filio emissae, 1640.

It is a noticeable fact, that Crashaw while still so young should have
been invited to contribute to these University Collections along with
Wren, Henry More, Edward King ('Lycidas'), Joseph Beaumont, Edward
Rainbow, and kindred. His pieces in each are recorded in the places in
our Volumes. They invite critical comment; but our space is fully
exhausted.

By the liberality of F. MADOX-BROWN, Esq. R.A. I am enabled to furnish
(in the 4to) in this our Second Volume an admirable photograph, by
Hollyer of London, of his cartoon for the memorial-window in Peterhouse,
Cambridge. Peterhouse is at late-last doing honour to some of her sons
thus. Professor Ward, of Owens' College, Manchester, has the praise, as
the privilege, of presenting the Crashaw portion of the fine Window.
The figure is full of dignity and impressiveness; we may accept the
creation of the Painter's genius for a Portrait. The accessories
are suggestive of familiar facts in the life and poetry of Crashaw.
Vignette-illustrations from W.J. LINTON, Esq. and Mrs. BLACKBURN again
adorn our volume (in 4to). I regard that to the 'Captive Bird' (p. xxi.)
as a gem. Finally, I cannot sufficiently acknowledge the cultured
sympathy with which Mr. CHARLES ROBSON (of my Printers), one of the old
learned school, has cooperated with me in securing accuracy. To 'err is
human,' but I believe our Volumes will be found as little blemished as
most. One misprint, however, caught our eye, just when our completed
Vol. I. was sent out, which troubled us as much as ever it would have
done Ritson, viz. 'anchor' for 'arrow' in Cowley's 'Hope' (p. 176, l.
23). Gentle Reader, be so good as correct this at once.

  A.B.G.

  Park View, Blackburn, Lancashire,
  March 4, 1873.

P.S. Three small overlooked items bearing on Crashaw having been
recovered from a missing Note-book, I add them here.

(_a_) The 1670 edition of the 'Steps,' &c. (whose title-page is given in
Vol. I. xliv.) was re-issued with an undated title-page as 'The Third
Edition. London, Printed for _Richard Bently_, _Jacob Tonson_, _Francis
Saunders_, and _Tho. Bennett_.' It is from the same type, and identical
in every way except the fresh title-page, with the (so-called) '2d
Edition.'

(_b_) In Thomas Shipman's 'Carolina, or Loyal Poems' (1683) there is a
somewhat scurril piece entitled 'The Plagiary, 1658. Upon S.C.,
Presbyterian Minister and Captain, stealing forty-eight lines from
Crashaw's Poems, to patch-up an Elegy for Mr. F. P[ierpont].' A very
small specimen must suffice:

                    'Soft, sir,--stand!
    You are arraign'd for theft; hold up your hand.
    Impudent theft as ever was exprest,
    Not to steal jewels only, but the chest;
    Not to nib bits of gold from Crashaw's lines,
    But swoop whole strikes together from his mynes.'

Another piece, 'The Promise. To F.L. Esq., with Crashaw's Poems (1653),'
has nothing quotable.

(_c_) In Aylett's Poems, 'Peace with her Fowre Gardens,' &c. (1622),
there are three little commendatory poems signed 'R.C.,' and these have
been assigned to Crashaw; but '1622' forbids this, as he was then only
in his 9-10th year. G.




CONTENTS.


    As neither Crashaw nor his early Editors furnished Contents to the
    Epigrammata et Poemata, we are left free to decide thereon; and
    inasmuch as (_a_) our translations are intended to make Vol. II. as
    generally accessible and understood as Vol. I, and as (_b_) very few
    of those here first printed have headings, or the Scripture-texts
    only--we have deemed it expedient to give as Contents the subjects
    in English. The Scholar-student will find the Latin headings of the
    Author in their places. In the right-hand margin the initials of the
    respective Translators are given; on which see pp. 4-5, and Notes to
    the successive divisions. [*] on left-hand margin indicates there is
    a Greek version also: [+] printed for first time: [x] translated for
    first time. G.

ESSAY ON THE LIFE AND POETRY OF CRASHAW.[2]


In our Memorial-Introduction (vol. i. p. xxvi.) we make two promises,
which fall now to be redeemed:

(_a_) A STUDY OF THE LIFE AND POETRY OF RICHARD CRASHAW.

(_b_) A MEMOIR OF WILLIAM CRASHAW, B.D., HIS FATHER.

The latter is in so many ways elucidative and illuminative of the
former, outwardly and inwardly, that I deem it well to give it first.


I. MEMOIR OF WILLIAM CRASHAW, B.D.

The late laborious and accurate Joseph Hunter, in his MS. collections
yclept Chorus Vatum, which by rare good fortune are preserved in the
British Museum (Addl. MSS. 24.487, pp. 34-39), thus begins, _s.n._

'I am here introducing a name which may be said to be hitherto unknown
in the regions of Poetry, and which has been unaccountably passed over
by biographical writers of every class; yet one who has just claims on
our attention of his own as well as in being the father of Richard
Crashaw, whose merits are admitted;' and he continues with a pleasant
egotism that one can readily pardon, 'and he has particular claims upon
me, as having been a native of the part of the kingdom from which I
spring, and bearing a name which is that of a numerous family from whom
I descend.'

We shall find onward, that the elder Crashaw had a unique gift of
Poetry; but independent of that, a somewhat prolonged acquaintance with
his numerous books enables us emphatically to ratify the 'claims' of
'_his own_' otherwise--though in strong, even fierce, antagonism as
Divine and Writer to his gentle-natured son's after-opinions.

Hitherto, in the brief and meagre notices of his son, and of the
paternal Crashaw, it has simply been stated that he was a
'_Yorkshireman_.' This is mentioned incidentally in various places. We
are now enabled by the interest in our researches of local Antiquaries,
together with aid from the Hunter and Cole MSS., to give for the first
time family-details. Handsworth, sometimes spelled Hansworth, near
Sheffield, one of the hamlets of England in the 'Black Country'--once
couched among green fields and hedge-row 'lanes,' though now blighted
and begrimed--was the 'nest' of the Crashaws; and there and in the
neighbourhood the name is met with until comparatively recent times.[3]
The Church-Register goes back to 1558, and under Baptisms, Aug. 24th,
1568, is this entry, 'Thomas, son of Richard Crawshaw, baptised;' and,
alas, under the following 'November 14th,' 'Thomas, son of Richard
Crawshaw, buried.' Next comes our Worthy:

'1572, October 26th, WILL., son of Richard Crawshaw, baptised.' There
follow: January 12th, 1574, 'Francis;' November 24th, 1577, 'Ann'--both
baptised; April 26th 1585, 'Richard,' son of Richard, buried; 1591,
'Robert Eairl [_sic_] and Dorothy Crawshaw married;' 1608, November
20th, 'Hellen Crawshaw, widow, buried.' Then in 1609, 1611, 1613, 1615,
1619, 1623, 1627, entries concerning the 'Francis' of 1574 and his
household. The name does not reappear until 1682, January 1st, when
'William, son of William Crawshaw, is 'baptised;' and so the usual
record of the light and shadow of 'Births and Marriages and Deaths' goes
on until July 22d, 1729.

It appears from these Register-data that the father of our William
Crashaw was named 'Richard,' and that he died in April 1585, when Master
William was passing his 13th year. It also appears that his mother was
named 'Hellen,' and that she died as 'a widow' in November 1608. In
addition to these entries, I have discovered that this 'Hellen' was
daughter of John Routh, of Waleswood; a name of mark in Yorkshire, in
itself and through marriages.[4] That we are right in all this is made
certain by his Will, wherein our Crashaw (_pater_) leaves 'to the
parishe of Hansworth, in Com. Ebor., where I was borne, my owne works,
all to be bounde together, to lye in the churche; and fourty shillings
in monye to the stocke of the poor of that parishe.'[5] So far as I can
gather from several family-tables which have been furnished to me,
_the_ Richard Crashaw, father of our William Crashaw, was son of another
Richard Crashaw, who in turn was Rector of Aston, next parish to
Handsworth, in 1539. Thus, if not of 'blue blood' in the heraldic sense,
the Crashaws must have been well-to-do; for they are found not only
intermarrying with good Yorkshire families, but also occupying
considerable social status: _e.g._ a son of Francis--described as of
Hansworth-Woodhouse, a hamlet of Hansworth--brother of William, was
admitted to the freedom of the Cutlers' Company of Sheffield in 1638,
and was Master in 1675. I have lineal descents brought down to the
present year; and the annals of the House may hold their own in
family-histories.[6] Our Worthy had life-long intercourse and life-long
friendships with the foremost in Yorkshire, as his Will genially and
quaintly testifies.

Fatherless in his 13th-14th year, his widowed mother must have been in
circumstances pecuniarily that enabled her to have William, at least,
'_prepared_' for the University. He was of renowned 'St. John's,'
Cambridge, designated by him his 'deere nurse and spirituall mother.'[7]
A MS. note by Thomas Baker, in his copy of 'Romish Forgeries and
Falsifications' (1606), now in the Library of St. John's, furnishes
almost the only definite notice of his University career that I have met
with, as follows: 'Guil. Crashawe Eboracensis admissus socius Coll. Jo.
pro Dna Fundatrice, authoritate Regia, sede vacante Epi. Elien. 19 Jan.
1593.'[8] Such is the 'entry' as given by Baker; but in the original it
is as follows: 'Gulielmus Chrashawe Eboracensis admissus sum sisator pro
Mr. Alveye Maij 1, 1591.' The Master and each senior Fellow chose
sizars at this date. Again: 'Ego Gulielmus Crashawe Eboracensis admissus
sum socius huius Collegij pro domina fundatrice, Authoritate regia, sede
vacante Episcopi Eliensis, 19 Januarij 1593' [_i.e._ 1593-4]. The
Bishop of Ely had the right of nominating one Fellow.[9] The See of Ely
was vacant from the death of Bishop Richard Cox, 22d July 1581, to the
occupancy of Martin Heton in 1598-9. Hence it came that the Queen
presented Crashaw to the fellowship of St. John's. (See Baker's St.
John's, by Mayor (vol. i. p. 438), for more details.) This was somewhat
late. How he obtained the patronage of Elizabeth does not appear. The
entry in 'White Vellum Book' of the College Treasury runs simply, 'Being
crediblie informed of the povertie and yet otherwise good qualities and
sufficiencie of Wm. Crashaw, B.A.' &c. The opening paragraphs of his
Will characteristically recount his successive ecclesiastical
appointments and preferments, and hence will fittingly come in here. 'In
the name of the true and everlivinge God, Amen. I William Crashawe,
Bachelor in Divinitie, Preacher of God's Worde. Firste at Bridlington,
then at Beverley in Yorkshire. Afterwards at the Temple; since then
Pastor of the Churche of Ag[nes] Burton, in the diocese of Yorke; nowe
Pastor of that too greate Parishe of White-Chappell in the suburbs of
London: the unworthye and unprofitable servante of God, make and ordaine
this my last Will and Testament.' Previous to the death of Elizabeth he
had been '_deprived_' of a 'little vicarage' ('A Discourse on Popish
Corruptions requiring a Kingly Reformation:' MS. in Royal Library).
Inquiries at Bridlington, formerly Burlington, and the several places
named, have resulted in nothing, from the destruction of muniments, &c.
In the earlier he must have been 'Curate' only. His many legacies of his
'owne workes,' which were to 'lye' in many churches, have all perished,
or at least disappeared; and equally so his various 'monyes' for the
'poore.' It is sorrowful to find how so very often like provisions are
discovered to have gone out of sight, to an aggregate few indeed
suspect.

With Agnes Burton he had closer relations, inasmuch as one 'item' of his
Will runs: 'The next avoydance of Ag. Burton, taken in my brother's name
(for which he knoweth what hath byn offered), I give and bequeathe the
same to my said brother Thomas, to be by him disposed to some worthy
man.'

He describes 'Mr. Henry Alvay,' 'the famous Puritan,' as his 'ffather in
Christ,' in bequeathing him 'one siluer pott with a cover loose, parcell
guilt, of about 13 ounces.'[10] When, or from whom, he received 'orders'
and ordination does not appear, but what our Worthy became as a Preacher
his 'Sermons' remain to attest. They attest his evangelical fervour even
to passion, his intense convictions, his wistful tenderness alternated
with the most vehement rebuke of fashionable sins and worldliness, his
deep personal love for the Lord Jesus, and a strangely pathetic yearning
for all men to be 'safe' in Him. He had a kind of holy ubiquity of zeal
in occupying pulpits where 'witness' was to be borne 'for the Truth.'
His motto, found in a copy of Valerius Maximus, and elsewhere, was
'Servire Deo regnare est' (Notes and Queries, 3d S. vii. 111). America
ought to prize his Sermon 'Preached in London before the Right
Honourable the Lord Lawarre, Lord Governour and Captaine Generall of
Virginia, and others of his Maiestie's Counsell for that Kingdome, and
the rest of the Adventurers in that Plantation. At the said Lord
Generall his leaue-taking of England, his natiue countrey, and departure
for Virginia, February 21, 1609. By W. Crashaw, Bachelar of Divinitie,
and Preacher at the Temple. Wherein both the lawfulnesse of that Action
is maintained, and the necessity thereof is also demonstrated, and so
much out of the grounds of Policie, as of Humanity, Equity and
Christianity. Taken from his mouth, and published by direction.' 1610.
The running heading is 'A New Yeere's Gift to Virginea.' The text is St.
Luke xxii. 32: 'I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and
when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.' There is no nobler
Sermon than this of the period; and it is only one of various equally
eloquent, impressive, and powerful. Politically the Preacher saw far
ahead, and his patriotism is chivalrous as Sidney's. Dr. Donne later
preached for the same Virginia Company. He had 'sought' to go as
secretary in the outset.

Our Worthy was twice married. Of his first wife--mother of Richard, our
'sweet Singer'--I have failed utterly to get so much as her name. Of his
second wife there remains a privately-printed tractate entitled 'The
Honovr of Vertve, or the Monument erected by the sorowfull Husband, and
the Epitaphes annexed by learned and worthy men, to the immortall memory
of that worthy gentlewoman Mrs. Elizabeth Crashawe. Who dyed in
child-birth, and was buried in Whit-Chappell, October 8, 1620. In the 24
yeare of her age.' Of inconceivable interest would this remarkable
tractate have been, had this been the Poet's mother; but the date shows
that Hunter, in his 'Chorus Vatum,' and others, are mistaken in their
statement that she was such. Richard Crashaw was born in 1612-3, while
the 'Epitaphes' and other allusions touchingly inform us that this fatal
'child-birth' was, 'as she most surely expected,' of her only child. The
great Usher preached her funeral-sermon, 'at which Sermon and Funerall
was present one of the greatest Assemblies that ever was seene in man's
memorie at the burial of any priuate person.' The illustrious
Preacher--who 'vseth,' the Memorial says, 'to be very wary and modeste
in commendation'--is very full and articulate in his praises of the
dead. One bit we read with wet eyes; for among other traits Usher
praises 'her singular motherly affection _to the child of her
predecessor_--a rare vertue [as he noted] in step-mothers at this
day.'[11] One can scarcely avoid a sigh that such a 'step-mother' was
not spared to such a 'child.' No 'quick' name is found to any of the
Verse, nor is the Verse intrinsically very memorable, except for its
wealth of sympathy towards the Widower.[12]

Of our Worthy's numerous Writings I have made out a careful
enumeration, inasmuch as the usual bibliographical authorities (as
Lowndes and Hazlitt) are exceedingly empty; but I must utilise it
elsewhere, seeing that such a catalogue of (for the most part) violent
invective against Popery were incongruous in an edition of the Poetry of
his so opposite-minded son. These three out of our collection will show
that Popery was the supreme object of his aversion; and even the full
title-pages give but a poor idea of the out-o'-way learning--for he was
a scholar among scholars--the grave wit, the sarcasm, the shrewd sense,
and, alas, the uncharity of these and kindred sermons and books. The
first is this, but from a later edition, for a reason that will appear:
'Loyola's Disloyalty; or the Iesvites' open Rebellion against God and
His Church. Whose Doctrine is Blasphemie, in the highest degree, against
the blood of Christ, which they Vilifie, and under-valew, that they
might uphold their Merits. By Consequent, encouraging all Traytors to
kill their lawfull Kings and Princes. With divers other Principles and
Heads of their damnable and erronious Doctrine. Worthy to be written and
read in these our doubtfull and dangerous times. 1643' (4to). This was
originally issued as 'The Iesvites' Gospell' (1610), and in 1621 and
1641 as 'The Bespotted Jesuit.' Be it specially noted that Crashaw
himself must not be made responsible for the after title-pages.[13] Next
is this: 'The Parable of Poyson. In Five Sermons of Spirituall Poyson,
&c. Wherein the poysonfull Nature of Sinne, and the Spirituall Antidotes
against it, are plainely and brefely set downe. Begun before the
Prince his Highnesse. Proceeded in at Greye's Inne and the Temple,
and finished at St. Martin's in the fields. By William Crashaw,
Batcheler of Diuinity, and Preacher of God's word. 1618' (4to). The
Epistle-dedicatory is dated from Agnes Burton, Yorkshire. 'The ioyfull 5
of Nouember, the day neuer to be forgotten.' The third is this: 'The New
Man, or a Svpplication from an vnknowne Person, a Roman Catholike, vnto
Iames, the Monarch of Great Brittaine, and from him to the Emperour,
Kings, and Princes of the Christian World. Touching the causes and
reasons that will argue a necessity of a Generall Councell to be
fortwith assembled against him that now vsurps the Papall Chaire vnder
the name of Paul the fifth. Wherein are discouered more of the secret
Iniquities of that Chaire and Court, then hitherto their friends feared,
or their very aduersaries did suspect. Translated into English by
William Crashaw, Batchelour in Diuinity, according to the Latine Copy,
sent from Rome into England. 1622' (4to). Other of these controversial
tractates, or 'Flytings' (Scotice), are more commonly known, and need
not detailed notice from us. That the 'ruling passion' was 'strong' to
the end, appears by the already repeatedly named Will, the opening of
which has been given, and which thus continues: 'For my religion, I
professe myself in lief and deathe a Christian, and the crosse of Jesus
Christ is my glorye, and His sufferings my salvation. I renounce and
abhorre Atheisme, Iudaisme, Turcisme, and all heresies against the Holy
and Catholike faithe, oulde and newe, and (namelye) Poperie, beinge as
nowe it is established by the canons of Trent and theyr present allowed
decrees and doctors, lyke a confused body of all heresies.' And again:
'I accounte Poperie (as it nowe is) the heape and chaos of all heresies,
and the channell whereunto the fowlest impieties and heresies that have
bene in the Christian worlde have runne and closelye emptied themselves.
I beleeve the Pope's seate and power to be the power of the greate
Antichrist, and the doctrine of the Pope (as nowe it is) to be the
doctrine of Antichrist; yea, that doctrine of devills prophesied of by
the Apostles, and that the trve and absolute Papist, livinge and
dyeinge, debarres himself of salvation for oughte that we knowe. And I
beleve that I am bounde to separate myself from that sinagogue of Rome
if I wil be saved. And I professe myselfe a member of the true Catholike
Churche, but not of the Roman Churche (as nowe it is), and to looke for
salvation, not by that faith nor doctrine which that Churche nowe
teacheth, but that which once it had, but now falne from it.' And then
follow 'groundes' in burning and 'hard' words, intermingled with strange
outbursts of personal humiliation before God and an awful sense of His
scrutiny.

These Title-pages and Will-extracts must suffice to indicate the
Ultra-Protestantism of the elder Crashaw. To qualify them--in addition
to our note of the intensified after title-pages _by others_--it must be
remembered that the Armada of 1588 flung its scaring shadow across his
young days, and that undoubtedly the descendants of Loyola falsified
their venerable Founder's intentions by political agitations and
plottings. These coloured our ecclesiastical polemique's whole ways of
looking at things. His Will and codicil are dated in 1621-2, and during
these years and succeeding, his most fiery and intense 'Sermons' and
tractates were being published. Richard was then growing up into his
teens, and without his 'second' mother. As Crashaw senior died in
1626--his Will having been 'proved' 16th October in that year--our
Poet-saint was only about 13-14 when he lost his father, scarcely ten
when appointed by him executor, the words being: 'I ordaine and make Mr.
Robert Dixon and _my sonne Richarde_ executors of my Will' (10th June
1622).[14]

His Epistles-dedicatory and private Letters (several of which are
preserved in the British Museum, and of which I have copies--one very
long to Sir Julius Caesar on his brother's illness) and his Will, make it
plain that our Worthy mingled in the highest society, and was consulted
in the most delicate affairs. His dedication of one of his most
pronounced books, 'Consilium quorundam Episcop. Bononiae &c.' (1613), to
Shakespeare's Earl of Southampton, _as to a trusted friend_, settles, to
my mind, the (disputed) fact as to the Earl having become a Protestant.
So too the translation of Augustine's 'City of God' (1620, 2d edition)
is dedicated to William Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Arundel, and the
Earl of Montgomery.

The last matter to be touched on is the Verse of the paternal Crashaw,
which has a unique character of its own. It consists of translations
from the Latin. His 'Loyola's Disloyalty' is based on a rendering of a
Latin poem in super-exaltation of the Virgin Mary by Clarus Bonarscius
(= Carolus Scribanius); and Crashaw animadverts on such 'pointes' as
these: 'That the milke of Mary may come into comparison with the blood
of Christ;' 'that the Christian man's faith may lawfully take hold of
both as well as one;' 'that the best compound for a sicke soule is to
mix together her milke and Christ's blood;' 'that Christ is still a
little child in His mother's armes, and so may be prayed unto;' 'that a
man shall often-times be sooner heard at God's hand in the mediation of
Mary than Jesus Christ;' and so on. I give the opening, middle, and
closing lines.


TO OUR LADY OF HALL AND THE CHILD JESUS.

    'My thoughts are at a stand, of milke and blood,
      Delights of brest and side, which yeelds most good;
    And say, when on the teates mine eyes I cast,
      O Lady, of thy brest I beg a taste.
    But if mine eyes upon the wounds doe glide,
      Then, Jesu, I had rather sucke Thy side.
    Long have I mused, now knowe I where to rest;
      For with my right hand I will graspe the brest,
    If so I may presume: as for the wounds,
      With left He catch them; thus my zeale abounds.'

Again:

    'Mother and Son, give eare to what I crave,
      I beg this milke, that bloud, and both would have.
    Youngling, that in Thy mother's armes art playing,
      Sucking her brest sometimes, and sometimes staying,
    Why dost Thou view me with that looke of scorne?
      'Tis forceless envie that 'gainst Thee is borne.
    Oft hast Thou said, being angry at my sinne,
      Darest thou desire the teates My food lyes in?
    I will not, oh I dare not, golden Child;
      My mind from feare is not so farre exild:
    But one, even one poore drop I doe implore
      From Thy right hand or side, I ask no more.
    If neither, from Thy left hand let one fall;
      Nay from Thy foot, rather than none at all:
    If I displease Thee, let Thy wounds me wound,
      But pay my wage if I in grace be found.'

Finally:

    'But ah, I thirst; ah, droght my breath doth smother,
      Quench me with blood, sweet Son; with milk, good mother
    Say to Thy mother, See My brother's thirst;
      Mother, your milke will ease him at the first.
    Say to thy Son, Behold Thy brother's bands;
      Sweet Son, Thou hast his ransome in Thy hands.
    Shew Thy redeeming power to soules opprest,
      Thou Sonne, if that Thy blood excel the rest.
    And shew Thyselfe justly so stilde indeed,
      Thou mother, if thy brests the rest exceed.
    Ah, when shall I with these be satisfi'd?
      When shall I swimme in joyes of brest and side?
    Pardon, O God, mine eager earnestnesse,
      If I Thy lawes and reason's bounds transgresse;
    Where thirst o're-swayes, patience is thrust away:
      Stay but my thirst, and then my cryes will stay.
    I am better then Thy nailes; yet did a streame
      Of Thy deere bloud wash both the lance and them.
    More worthy I then clouts; yet them a flood
      Moistened of mother's milke and of Son's blood.'

Rhythm, epithet, and the whole ring of these Verses remind us of the
younger Crashaw. But the most remarkable Verse-production of the elder
Crashaw is his translation of the 'Querela, sive Dialogvs Animae et
Corporis damnati,' ascribed to St. Bernard. It originally appeared in
1616, and has been repeatedly reprinted since. Those of 1622 and 1632
are now before me, and the English title-page runs: 'The Complaint, or
Dialogve betwixt the Soule and the Bodie of a damned man. Each laying
the fault vpon the other. Supposed to be written by S. Bernard, from a
nightly vision of his; and now published out of an ancient manuscript
copie. By William Crashaw.' The Dialogue thus opens:

    'In silence of a Winter's night,
    A sleeping yet a walking spirit;
      A livelesse body to my sight
      Methought appeared, thus addight.

    In that my sleepe I did descry
    A Soule departed but lately
      From that foule body which lay by;
      Wailing with sighes, and loud did cry.

    Fast by the body, thus she mones
    And questions it, with sighes and grones;
      O wretched flesh, thus low who makes thee lye,
      Whom yesterday the world had seene so high?

    Was't not but yesterday the world was thine,
      And all the countrey stood at thy devotion?
    Thy traine that followed thee when thy sunne did shine
      Have now forsaken thee: O dolefull alteration!

    Those turrets gay of costly masonry,
      And larger palaces, are not now thy roome;
    But in a coffin of small quantity
      Thou lyest interred in a little tombe.
           .       .       .       .       .
    O wretched flesh, with me that art forlorne,
      If thou couldst know how sharpe our punishment;
    How justly mightest thou wish not to be borne,
      Or from the wombe to tombe to have been hent!
           .       .       .       .       .
    How lik'st thou now, poor foole, thy latter lodging,
      The roofe whereof lyes even with thy nose?
    Thy eyes are shut, thy tongue cannot be cogging;
      Nothing of profit rests at thy dispose.
           .       .       .       .       .
    Thy garments, wretched fool, are farre from rich;
      Thy upper garment hardly worth a scute;
    A little linnen shrouds thee in thy ditch,
      No rents nor gifts men bring, nor make their suite.'

Again, st. 79-81:

    'If I be clad in rich array,
    And well attended every day,
    Both wise and good I shal be thoght,
    My kinred also shall be sought.
    I am, say men, the case is cleere,
    Your cosen, sir, a kinsman neere.
    But if the world doe change and frowne,
    Our kinred is no longer knowne;
    Nor I remembred any more
    By them that honoured me before.
    O vanity! vile love of mucke,
    Foule poyson, wherefore hast thou stucke
    Thyselfe so deepe, to raise so high
    Things vanishing so suddenly?'

In a 'Manvall for true Catholicks, or a Handfvll, or rather a Heartfull
of holy Meditations and Prayers, gathered out of certaine ancient
Manuscripts, written 300 yeeres agoe, or more,' which is usually bound
up with the 'Querela,' there is no little striking thought and
word-painting, combined with a parsimony of epithet, and a naked and yet
imaginative echo of the monkish Latin, singularly impressive. Passing
the 'Orthodoxall Confessions of God the Father' and 'Sonne' and 'Holy
Ghost,' though all have many memorable things--I would close our
specimens with one complete poem from the 'Manvall.' It is entitled 'The
Conclusion, with a devout and holy prayer;' the word 'prayer' reminding
us that in his Prayers herein and in his 'Milke for Babes' (1618, and
several later), Crashaw is lowly and devout, and simply a sinner holding
the Christian's hope. The remark applies also to much of his celebration
of 'Carraciolo,' the Italian convert and 'Second Moses' (1608).

    'This is Christian faith unfained,
    Orthodoxall, true, unstained.
    As I teach, all understand,
    Yeelding unto neither hand.
    And in this my soule's defence,
    Reiect me not for mine offence:
    Thogh Death's slave, yet desperation
    I fly in death to seek salvation.
    I have no meane Thy love to gain,
    But this faith which I maintaine.
    This Thou seest, nor will I cease
    By this to beg for a release.
    Let this sacred salve be bound
    Vpon my sores, to make them sound.
    Though man be carried forth, and lying
    In his grave, and putrifying:
    Bound and hid from mortall eyes;
    Yet if Thou bid, he must arise.
    At Thy will the grave will open,
    At Thy will his bonds are broken.
    And forth he comes without delay,
    If Thou but once bid, Come away!
    In this sea of dread and doubt
    My poore barke is tost about;
    With storms and pirats far and wide,
    Death and woes on every side.
    Come, thou Steer's-man ever blest,
    Calme these winds that me molest;
    Chase these ruthlesse pyrats hence,
    And show me some safe residence.
    My tree is fruitles, dry, and dead,
    All the boughs are withered;
    Downe it must, and to the fire,
    If desert have his due hire.
    But spare it, Lord, another yeare.
    With manuring it [yet] may beare.
    If it then be dead and dry,
    Burne it; alas, what remedy!
    Mine old foe assaults me sore
    With fire and water, more and more.
    Poore I, of all my strength bereft,
    Onely unto Thee am left.
    That my foe may hence be chased,
    And I from Ruin's clawes released,
    Lord, vouchsafe me every day
    Strength to fast, and faith to pray:
    These two meanes Thyself hast taught
    To bring temptation's force to noght.
    Lord, free my soule from sin's infection
    By repentance's direction.
    Be Thy feare in me abiding,
    My soule to true salvation guiding.
    Grant me faith, Lord, hope, and love,
    Zeale of heaven and things above.
    Teach mee prize the world at nought;
    On Thy blisse be all my thought.
    All my hopes on Thee I found,
    In Whom all good things abound.
    Thou art all my dignitie:
    All I have I have from Thee.
    Thou art my comfort in distresse,
    Thou art my cure in heavinesse;
    Thou art my music in my sadnes,
    Thou art my medicine in my madnesse.
    Thou my freedom from my thral,
    Thou my raiser from my fall.
    In my labour Thou reliev'st me;
    Thou reform'st whatever grieves me.
    Al my wrongs Thy hand revengeth,
    And from hurt my soul defendeth.
    Thou my deepest doubts revealest,
    Thou my secret faults concealest.
    O do Thou stay my feet from treading
    In paths to hel and horror leading,
    Where eternal torment dwels,
    With fears and tears and lothsome smels;
    Where man's deepest shame is sounded,
    And the guilty still confounded;
    Where the scourge for ever beateth,
    And the worme that alwaies eateth;
    Where all those endless do remain,
    Lord, preserve us from this paine.
    In Sion lodge me, Lord, for pitty--
    Sion, David's kingly citty,
    Built by Him that's onely good;
    Whose gates be of the Crosse's wood;
    Whose keys are Christ's undoubted word;
    Whose dwellers feare none but the Lord;
    Whose wals are stone, strong, quicke and bright;
    Whose Keeper is the Lord of Light:
    Here the light doth never cease,
    Endlesse Spring and endles peace;
    Here is musicke, heaven filling,
    Sweetnesse evermore distilling;
    Here is neither spot nor taint,
    No defect, nor no complaint;
    No man crooked, great nor small,
    But to Christ conformed all.
    Blessed towne, divinely graced,
    On a rocke so strongly placed,
    Thee I see, and thee I long for;
    Thee I seek, and thee I grone for.
    O what ioy thy dwellers tast,
    All in pleasure first and last!
    What full enioying blisse divine,
    What iewels on thy wals do shine!
    Ruby, iacinth, chalcedon,
    Knowne to them within alone.
    In this glorious company,
    In the streets of Sion, I
    With Iob, Moses, and Eliah,
    Will sing the heauenly Alleviah. Amen.

Surely this is a very noteworthy transfusion of old Latin pieties into
vivid English. 'Visions' of Jerusalem the Golden transfigure even the
austere words towards the close. One can picture Master Richard's eyes
kindling over his Father's verses when he was gone.

So endeth what I have thought it needful to tell of the elder Crashaw.
As hitherto almost nothing has been told of him, even our compressed
little Memorial--keeping back many things and notices that have gathered
in our note-books--may be welcome to some. I pass now to


II. A STUDY OF THE LIFE AND POETRY OF RICHARD CRASHAW.

The outward facts of our 'sweet Singer's' story are given with
comparative fulness in our Memorial-Introduction (vol. i. pp.
xxvii.-xxxviii.). In the present brief Essay we wish to look into some
of these, so as to arrive at a true estimate of them and of the Poetry,
now fully (and for the first time) collected.

I think I shall be able to say what has struck myself as worth saying
about Crashaw, under these three things:

I. His change from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism, using the terms
as historic words, not polemically.

II. His friends and associates, as celebrated in his Writings.

III. His characteristics and place as a Poet. These successively.

I. _His change from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism._ From our Memoir
of his Father it will be apparent to all that _he_ was a Protestant of
Protestants; and it is an inevitable assumption that his son from
infancy would be indoctrinated with all vigilance and fervour in the
paternal creed, which may be designated Puritan, as opposed to Laudian
High-Churchism within the Church of England.[15] I think we shall not
err either, in concluding that the younger Crashaw had a very
impressionable and plastic nature; so that the strong and self-assertive
character of his Father could not fail to mould his earliest thinking,
opinions, beliefs, and emotion. Still it will not do to pronounce our
Poet's change to have been a revolt and rebound from the narrowness of
the paternal teaching and writing, seeing that his Father died in 1626,
when he was only passing into his 13-14th year.[16] It is palpable that
the elder Crashaw was spared the distress of the apostacy (as he should
most trenchantly have named it) of his only son. Moreover, the very
notable poems from the Tanner MSS. on the _Gunpowder Treason_ (vol. i.
pp. 188-194) are pronounced and intense in their denunciations of (to
quote from them) that 'vnmated malice,' that 'vnpeer'd despight' and
'very quintessence of villanie,' for 'singing' of which he feels he must
have not 'inke' but 'the blood of Cerberus, or Alecto's viperous brood,'
and demonstrate that he carried with him to, and kept in, Cambridge all
his father's wrath, and more than even his father's vocabulary of
vituperation, with too his own after-epithets, instinct with poetic
feeling, as a thoughtful reading reveals. These poems belong to 1631-3.
Even in the Latin Epigrams of 1634 there is (to say the least) a
'slighting' allusion to the Pope in the 'Umbra S. Petri,' being 'Nunc
quoque, Papa, tuum sustinet illa decus' (see Epigram xix. p. 47). That
volume, also, is dedicated in the most glowing words of affection and
indebtedness to Dr. Benjamin Lany (vol. ii. pp. 7-15), afterwards, as we
shall find onward, a distinguished bishop in the Church of England. And
he was a man after the elder Crashaw's own heart, as we shall now have
revealed in a little overlooked poem addressed to Crashaw senior, which
is appended to the 'Manvall for True Catholicks' (as before). Here it
is; and let the Reader ponder its anti-papal sentiment:


A CONCLUSION TO THE AUTHOR AND HIS BOOKE.

    Tradition and antiquitie, the ground
      Whereon that erring Church doth so relye,
    Breakes out to light, from darknesse, to confound
      The novel doctrine of their heresie,
    Which plaine by these most sensible degrees
      Doth point the wayes it hath digrest to fall;
    Where each observing iudgement plainely sees,
      From good to bad, from bad to worst of all
    It is arriv'd: so that it can aspire,
      Obscure, deface, suppresse, doe what it may,
    To blinde this truth; to no step any higher
      By any policie it can essay.
    These holy Hymnes stuft with religious zeale
      And meditations of most pious use,
    Able their whole to wound, our wounded heale:
      Free from impiety, or least abuse,
    Blot out all merit in ourselves we have,
      And onely, solely, doe on Christ relye:
    Offer not prayers for those are in the grave,
      Nor unto saints, that heare not, doe not cry.
    Then in a word, since God hath thee preserv'd
      From the Inquisitors' most cruel rage,
    Though in their worth they else might have deserv'd
      To passe among the good things of this Age,
    Yet are in this respect of more regard,
      Since God would have them to these times appeare,
    So many having perisht; and be heard
      With more true zeale, that God hath kept so deare.
    By all which I conclude, from thine owne heart,
      Thou wicked servant, that might know and would not,
    He hath discharg'd himselfe in all and part,
      That would have cur'd your Babel, but hee could not.

                                                        B.L.

There is some obscurity in these Donne- or Ben-Jonson-like rugged lines,
but none as to the opinions of their writer on Popery. Thus up to 1634
at least, or until his twenty-second or twenty-third year, Crashaw the
younger was as thoroughly Protestant, in all probability, as his father
could have desired. The '_change_' accordingly was a radical one when he
left his mother-Church, and one laments that our light is so dim and our
view so distant. Anthony a-Wood (as before) and the usual authorities
state that our Crashaw became famous as a preacher: he became, says
Willmott, 'a preacher of great energy and power,' _id est_, in England,
and therefore while still belonging to the Church of England. I have an
impression that somehow the son has been confounded with the father,
whose renown as a preacher was lasting; just as it seems certain that
son and father have been confounded by the continuous editors of
Selden's 'Table-Talk,' wherein the illustrious Thinker recounts
somewhat proudly that he had converted Crashaw from his opposition to
stage-plays. We may as well expiscate this point here. The younger
Crashaw, then, never expressed himself, so far as is known, against
stage-plays: contrari-wise, in his fine Epigram on Ford's 'Love's
Sacrifice' and 'Broken Heart' he is in sympathy with these
'stage-plays.' On the other hand, in one of his most impassioned
sermons, his father had, with characteristic pungency, condemned 'Plaies
and Players'--as given below.[17] To return: be this as it may in the
matter of 'preaching,' the matter-of-fact is, that our Crashaw retained
his Fellowship up to his ejection on the 11th of June 1644 (vol. i. pp.
xxxiii.-iv.), or when he was in his 32d-33d year; or, as gentle Father
Southwell gently put it, about his 'dear Lord's' age. We get a glimpse
of his religious life while a Protestant, in the original 'Preface to
the Reader' of 'Steps to the Temple,' &c. as follows: 'Reader, we stile
his Sacred Poems, Steps to the Temple, and aptly; for in the Temple of
God, under His wing, he led his life, in St. Marie's Church neere St.
Peter's Colledge: there he lodged under Tertullian's roofe of angels;
there he made his nest more gladly than David's swallow neere the house
of God, where, like a primitive saint, he offered more prayers in the
night than others usually offer in the day; there he penned these poems,
STEPS for happy soules to climbe heaven by' (vol. i. p. xlvii.).
Coinciding with this is the love he had for the writings of 'Sainte
Teresa,' when (in his own words) 'the Author' of 'A Hymn to the Name
and Honor of the admirable Sainte Teresa' was 'yet among the
Protestants.' In his 'Apologie for the foregoing Hymn'--than which, for
subtle, delicate, fin_est_ mysticism, in words that are not so much
words as music, and yet definite words too, changing with the quick
bright changes of a dove's neck, there is hardly anything truer--the
Poet traces up his devotion to her to his 'reading' of her books; as
thus:

    'Thus haue I back again to thy bright name,
    Fair floud of holy fires! transfus'd the flame
    I took from reading thee....
    ... O pardon, if I dare to say
    Thine own dear bookes are guilty.'  (vol. i. p. 150.)

The words of the Preface (as above) remind us also that Crashaw took his
part in the Fasts and Vigils and austerities of the Ferrars and the
saintly, if ascetic, 'Little Gidding' group.[18] Going back on the
'Hymn,' such lines as these show how even then the Poet had drunk-in the
very passion of Teresa: _e.g._

    'Loue toucht her heart, and, lo, it beates
    High, and burnes with such braue heates,
    Such thirsts to dy, as dares drink vp
    _A thousand cold deathes in one cup_.
    Good reason: for she breathes all fire;
    Her white breast heaues with strong desire.
           .       .       .       .       .
    Sweet, not so fast! lo, thy fair Spouse,
    Whom thou seekst with so swift vowes,
    Calls thee back, and bidds thee come
    T'embrace a milder martyrdom.
      Blest powres forbid thy tender life
    Should bleed vpon a barbarous knife:
    Or some base hand have power to raze
    Thy brest's chast cabinet, and vncase
    A soul kept there so sweet: O no,
    Wise Heaun will neuer haue it so.
    Thou art Love's victime, and must dy
    A death more mystical and high:
    Into Loue's armes thou shalt let fall
    A still-suruiuing funerall.
    His is the dart must make the death
    Whose stroke shall tast thy hallow'd breath;
    A dart thrice dipt in that rich flame
    Which writes thy Spouse's radiant name
    Vpon the roof of Heau'n, where ay
    It shines; and with a soueraign ray
    Beates bright vpon the burning faces
    Of soules which in that Name's sweet graces
    Find everlasting smiles.  .  .
    O how oft shalt thou complain
    Of a sweet and subtle pain;
    Of intolerable ioyes;
    Of a death, in which who dyes
    Loues his death, and dyes again,
    And would for ever so be slain,
    And liues and dyes; and knowes not why
    To live, but that he thus may neuer leaue to dy.'

It is deeply significant to find such a Hymn as that written while 'yet
among the Protestants.' Putting the two things together--(_a_) his
recluse, shy, meditative life 'under Tertullian's roofe of angels,' and
his prayers THERE in the night; (_b_) his passionately sympathetic
reading, as of Teresa, and going forth of his most spiritual yearnings
after the 'sweet and subtle pain,' and Love's death 'mystical and
high'--we get at the secret of the 'change' now being considered.
However led to it, Crashaw's reading lay among books that were as fuel
to fire brought to a naturally mystical and supersensitive temperament;
and however formed and nurtured, such self-evidently was his
temperament. His innate mysticism drew him to such literature, and the
literature fed what perchance demanded rather to be neutralised.[19] I
feel satisfied one main element of the attraction of Roman Catholicism
for him was the nutriment and nurture for his profoundest though most
perilous spiritual experiences in its Writers. His great-brained,
strong-thewed father would have dismissed such 'intolerable ioyes' as
morbid sentimentalism; but the nervous, finely and highly-strung
organisation of his son was as an Aeolian harp under their touch. To all
this must be added certain local influences, and ultimately the crash of
the Ejection. The history of the University during the period of
Crashaw's residence makes it plain that there was then, as later, a
revival of what may be technically called Ritualism--as an intended
help-meet to Faith--and that by some of the most cultured and gracious
scholars of the Colleges. I am not vindicating, much less judging such,
any more than would I 'sit in judgment' on the Ritualist revival of our
own day, _i.e._ of its adherents. For myself, I find it a diviner and
grander thing to 'walk by faith' rather than by 'sight,' and not
'bodied' but 'disembodied truth' the more spiritual. But to not a
few--and to such as Crashaw--the sensible, the visible, the actually
looked-at--sanctified with the hoar of centuries--light up and
etherealise. Contemporary records show that the chapel of
Peterhouse--Crashaw's college--which was built in 1632, and consecrated
by Francis White, Bishop of Ely, was a 'handsome' one, having a
beautiful ceiling and a noble east window--its glass 'hid away in the
troublesome times.' Among the benefactors to its building were
(afterwards bishops) Cosin and Wren, and also Shelford, whose 'Five
learned Discourses' were graced with a noticeable 'commendatory poem'
by Crashaw (vol. ii. pp. 162-5). Before this chapel was built the
society made use of the chancel of the adjacent church of Little St.
Mary's, into which there was a door from Peterhouse College. The reader
may at this point turn to our poet's heart-broken 'pleadings' for the
'restoration' of his College, now made 'to speak English.' On all which,
and the like, dear old Fuller, in his History of the University, thus
speaks, under a somewhat later date (1642), but _the_ very
turning-period with Crashaw: 'Now began the University to be much
beautified in buildings; every college, after casting its skin with the
snake, or renewing its bill with the eagle, having their courts, or at
least their fronts and gatehouse, repaired and adorned. But the greatest
attention was in their chapels, most of them being graced with the
accession of organs,' &c.

Contemporary records farther lead us to Peterhouse and Pembroke Colleges
as specially 'visited' and 'spoiled' in the Commission from the
Parliament in 1643 to remove crosses. We may read one 'report' out of
many. 'Mr. Horscot: We went to Peterhouse, 1643, Dec. 21, with officers
and soldiers, and [in] the presence [of] Mr. Wilson, of the president
Mr. Francis, Mr. Maxy and other Fellows, Dec. 20 and 23, we pulled down
two mighty great angells with wings, and divers other angells and the
four Evangelists and Peter with his keies, over the Chappell Dore, and
about a hundred cherubims and angells and divers superstitious letters
in gold; and at the upper end of the chancel these words were written as
followeth: "Hic locus est Domini Dei, nil aliud et Porta coeli."
Witness, Will. Dowsing, Geo. Long.' Farther: 'These words were written
at Keie's Coll. and not at Peterhouse, but about the walls were written
in Latin, "We prays thee ever;" and on some of the images was written
"Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus;" or other, "Gloria Dei et Gloria Patri,"
and "Non nobis Domine;" and six angells in the windowes.' So at
Pembroke, 'We brake and pulled down 80 superstitious pictures;' and so
at Little St. Mary's, 'We brake down 60 superstitious pictures, some
Popes and crucifixes and God the Father sitting in a chayer and holding
a glass in his hand.' Looking on the since famous names of Peterhouse
and Pembroke (Spenser's college)--Cosin, Wren, Shelford, Tournaye,
Andrewes--they at once suggest ritualistic, if not Roman Catholic,
proclivities.

Thus from all sides came potent influences of personal friendship--of
his friends and associates more onward--to give impulse and _momentum_
to Crashaw's mystical Roman-Catholic sympathies. The 'Ejection' of 1644
found Crashaw in the very heart of these influences, not swayed simply,
but mastered by them. To one so secluded and unworldly, a crisis in
which the pillars of the throne were shattered, and in which not the
many for the one, but the one rather than the many, must be sacrificed,
was a dazing bewilderment, and terror, and agony. All was chaos and
weltering confusion; no resting-place in England for his dove-feet:
dissonance, blasphemy as he weened, came to his shuddering heart: he saw
the lifting-up of anchors never before lifted, and the Church drifting,
drifting away aimlessly and helplessly (as he misjudged). Moses-like, he
looked this way and that way, and saw no man--saw not The Man--and
failed, I fear, to look UP, because of his very agony of looking down
and in. And so, in his tremor and sorrow and weariness, he passed over
to Roman Catholicism as the 'ideal' of his reading, and as the 'home' of
the sainted ones whose words were as manna to his spirit. Not a strong,
defiant, masterful soul, by any means--frail, timorous, shrinking,
rather--he would 'fly away,' even if out to the wilderness, to be 'at
rest.' The very 'inner life' of God was in his soft gentle heart, and
that he carried with him through after-years, as Cowley bore brave
witness by his magnanimous title of 'Saint.' Conscience
too--ill-instructed possibly, yet true to its light, if true also to
feelings that ought to have been wrestled with, not succumbed to--went
with him: and what of God's grace is in a man keeps him, wherever
ecclesiastically he may abide.

Such is our solution of the 'change' of Crashaw from Protestantism to
Catholicism. It is sheer fanaticism to rave against the 'change,' and to
burrow for ignoble motives. Gross ignorance of the facts of the period
is betrayed by any one who harshly 'judges' that the humble 'ejected
Fellow' made a worldly 'gain' by his 'change.' Nay verily, it was no
'gain,' in that paltry sense, for an Englishman then to become a Roman
Catholic. It was to invite obloquy, misconstruction, 'evil-speaking.' In
Crashaw's case he had wealthy uncles and aunts, and other relatives, who
should have amply provided for him, and 'sheltered' him through the
'troublous times.' Prynne's 'Legenda Lignea, with an Answer to Mr.
Birchley's Moderator (pleading for a Toleration of Popery) and a
Character of some hopeful saints revolted to the Church of Rome' (1653),
is brutal as it is inaccurate; but it must be adduced as an example of
what 'Revolters' (so called) had to endure, albeit Crashaw was gone into
the silences whither no clamour reaches, when the bitter book came
forth. 'Master Richard Crashaw (son to the London divine, and sometime
Fellow of St. Peterhouse in Cambridge) is another slip of the times that
is transplanted to Rome. This peavish sillie seeker glided away from his
principles in a poetical vein of fancy and impertinent curiosity, and
finding that verses and measured flattery took and much pleased some
female wits, Crashaw crept by degrees into favour and acquaintance with
some court ladies, and with the gross commendations of their parts and
beauties (burnished and varnished with some other agreeable adulations)
he got first the estimation of an innocent, harmless convert; and a
purse being made by some deluded, vain-glorious ladies and their
friends, the poet was despatched on a pilgrimage to Rome, where, if he
had found in the see Pope Urban the Eighth instead of Pope Innocent, he
might possibly have received a greater quantity and a better number of
benedictions; for Urban was as much a pretender to be prince and
oecumenical patron of poets as head of the Church; but Innocent being
more harsh and dry, the poor small poet Crashaw met with none of the
generation and kindred of Mecaenas, nor any great blessing from his
Holiness; which misfortune puts the pitiful wier-drawer to a humour of
admiring his own raptures; and in this fancy (like Narcissus) he is
fallen in love with his own shadow, conversing with himself in verse,
and admiring the birth of his own brains; he is only laughed at, or at
most but pitied, by his few patrons, who, conceiving him unworthy of any
preferment in their Church, have given him leave to live (like a lean
swine almost ready to starve) in a poor mendicant quality; and that
favour is granted only because Crashaw can rail as satirically and
bitterly at true religion in verse as others of his grain and complexion
can in prose and loose discourses: this fickle shuttlecock, so tost with
every changeable puff and blast, is rather to be laughed at and scorned
for his ridiculous levity than imitated in his sinful and notorious
apostacy and revolt' (cxxxviii.).

The short and crushing answer to all this Billingsgate is: The poems of
Crashaw are now fully before the reader, and he will not find, from the
first page to the last, one line answering to Prynne's jaundiced
representations: 'flatteries,' 'adulations,' 'railings,' you look for in
vain. The wistfulness of persuasion of the Verse-Letter to the Countess
of Denbigh would have been trampled on as a blind man or a boor
tramples on a bed of pansies, by the grim lawyer-Puritan. Then, the very
lowliness and (alleged) mendicancy of his post in the Church of Rome
might have suggested a grain of charity, seeing that worldly advancement
could not be motive to an all-but friendless scholar. As to the 'birth
of his own brains,' and 'conversing with himself in verse,' would that
we had more such 'births' and 'conversings'! Other accusations are
malignant gossip, where they are not nonsense. Far different is the
spirit of Dr. John Bargrave; whose MS. has at last been worthily edited
and published for the Camden Society.[20] His notice of Crashaw at Rome
is as follows: 'When I went first of my four times to Rome, there were
there four revolters to the Roman Church that had been Fellows of
Peterhouse in Cambridge with myself. The name of one of them was Mr. R.
Crashaw, who was one of the _Seguita_ (as their term is): that is, an
attendant or of the followers of this Cardinal, for which he had a
salary of crowns by the month (as the custom is), but no diet. Mr.
Crashaw infinitely commended his Cardinal, but complained extremely of
the wickedness of those of his retinue; of which he, having the
Cardinal's ear, complained to him. Upon which the Italians fell so far
out with him that the Cardinal, to secure his life, was fain to put him
from his service, and procuring him some small employ at the Lady's of
Loretto; whither he went on pilgrimage in summer time, and, overheating
himself, died in four weeks after he came thither, and it was doubtful
whether he was not poisoned' (p. 37). That brings before us a true,
white-souled Man 'of God,' resolute to 'speak out,' whoever sinned in
his sight; and it is blind sectarianism to deny that, from the noble and
holy Loyola to our own Faber and Spencer and the living Newman, the
Church of Rome has never been without dauntless preachers of the very
righteousness of God, or unhesitant rebukers of the wickedness,
immoralities, and frivolities of their co-religionists. The suspicion of
'poyson' I am unwilling to accept. Onward I shall give our recovered
record of his death. Summarily, then, the 'change' of Crashaw from
Protestantism to Roman Catholicism had its root and carries its solution
in his 'mystical' dreamy temperament and yearnings, as these were
over-encouraged instead of controlled; and as formative influences there
were--(_a_) his reading in Teresa and kindred literature, until not
'hands,' but brain and heart, imagination and fancy, grew into the
elements wherein they wrought--as one finds sprays of once-green moss
and delicate-carven ferns changed by the dripping limestone into
limestone: (_b_) the ritualistic revival being in the hands of those
most loved and trusted, and from whom he fetched whatever of spiritual
life and peace and joy and hope was in him--these too being of stronger
will, and decisive in opinion and action--his vague 'feeling-after' rest
was centred in the Rest of ideal Roman Catholicism: (_c_) the confusions
and strifes of the transition-period of the Commonwealth terrified and
wounded him; he mistook the crash of falling scaffolding, whose end was
served, for the falling of the everlasting skies; saw not their serene
shining beyond the passing clouds, lightning-charged for divine
clarifying; and a 'quiet retreat,' which Imagination beckoned him to,
won him to 'hide' there his weeping and dismay. Nothing sordid or
expedient, or facing-both-ways, or unworthy, moved him to 'change.'
Every one who has self-respect based on self-knowledge, and who thus has
experienced the mystery of his deepest beliefs, will make all gentlest
allowances, hold all tenderest sympathies with him, and feel the coarse
abuse of Prynne and later as a personal wrong. Richard Crashaw was a
true 'man of God,' and acted, I believe, in sensitive allegiance to his
conscience as it spake to him. 'Change,' even fundamental change, in
such a man is to be accepted without reserve as 'honest' and righteous
and God-fearing. He dared not sign the 'Solemn League and Covenant,'
however 'solemn' it might be to others; and so he went out.[21] I pass
to--

II. _His friends and associates, as celebrated in his writings._ I use
the word 'Writings' here rather than 'Poems,' because in his Epistles,
_e.g._ to the 'Epigrammata' and those printed by us for the first time,
as well as in his Poetry, names are found over which one pauses
instinctively. Commencing with his school-days at the Charterhouse,
there is Robert Brooke, 'Master' ('Preceptor') from 1628 to 1643.[22]
Very little has come down to us concerning him, and the present head of
the renowned School has been unable to add to Alexander Chalmers'
testimony, 'A very celebrated Master.' All the more have I pleasure in
inviting attention to the new 'Epistola' and related poems addressed to
him, and which must be studied along with the previous poem,
'Ornatissimo viro praeceptori suo colendissimo, Magistro Brook' (vol. ii.
pp. 319); and perhaps the humorous and genial serio-comic celebration of
'Priscianus' grew from some school-incident (vol. ii. pp. 308, 315)
having in the latter year, like Crashaw, been 'ejected' from the
Charterhouse for not taking the 'Solemn League and Covenant.' He had
been usher from 1626 to 1628. An apartment in the building is still
called from him Brooke Hall ('Chronicles,' pp. 129, 159).

The next prominent name is that of Benjamin Lany--sometimes Laney, as in
Masson's Milton (i. 97)--afterwards successively Bishop of Peterborough
and Lincoln and Ely. We have already noted his marked Protestantism in
the verse-eulogy of the elder Crashaw, so that probably it was as his
father's son, Lany, then Master of Pembroke, received our Worthy there.
Lany was of the 'ejected' in 1644. The present Bishop of Ely, with all
willingness to help us, found no MSS. or biographic materials in his
custody. When may we hope each bishopric will find a qualified
historian-biographer? A portrait of Lany is in the Master's Lodge at the
Charterhouse ('Chronicles,' 1847, p. 140).

Crashaw's tutor at Pembroke was 'Master Tournay,' to whose praise and
friendship he dedicates a Latin poem (vol. ii. pp. 371 et sqq.). Dr.
Ward, Master of Sidney College, writes to Archbishop Usher thus of him:
'We have had some doings here of late about one of Pembroke Hall, who,
preaching in St. Mary's, about the beginning of Lent, upon that text,
James ii. 22, seemed to avouch the insufficiency of faith to
justification, and to impugn the doctrine of our 11th Article, of
Justification by faith only; for which he was convented by the
Vice-Chancellor, who was willing to accept of an easy acknowledgment;
but the same party preaching his Latin sermon, _pro Gradu_, the last
week, upon Rom. iii. 28, he said he came not _palinodiam canere, sed
eandem cantilenam canere_; which moved our Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Love, to
call for his sermon, which he refused to deliver. Whereupon, upon
Wednesday last, being Barnaby Day, the day appointed for the admission
of the Bachelors of Divinity, which must answer _Die Comitiorum_, he was
stayed by the major part of the suffrages of the Doctors of the
faculty.... The truth is, there are some Heads among us that are great
abettors of M. Tournay, the party above mentioned, who, no doubt, are
backed by others' (June 14, 1643. Life of Parr, p. 470: Willmott, 1st
series, pp. 302-3). In relation to Tournay's heresy on 'Justification,'
it is profoundly interesting, biographically, to remember Crashaw's most
striking Latin poems--so carelessly overlooked, if not impudently
suppressed, by Turnbull--first published by Crashaw in the volume of
1648, viz. 'Fides, quae sola justificat, non est sine spe et dilectione,'
and 'Baptismus non tollit futura peccata.' The student will do well to
turn to these two poems in their places (vol. ii. pp. 209, 216).[23]

Robert Shelford, 'of Ringsfield in Suffolk, Priest,' was another
'_suspect_:' as in Huntley's [ = Prynne] _Breviate_ (3d ed. 1637, p.
308) we read, 'Master Shelford hath of late affirmed in print, that the
Pope was never yet defined to be the Antichrist by any Synods.' More
vehemently writes Usher to Dr. Ward (Sept. 15, 1635): 'But while we
strive here to maintain the purity of our ancient truth, how cometh it
to pass that you at Cambridge do cast such stumbling-blocks in our way,
by publishing unto the world such rotten stuff as Shelford hath vented
in his Five Discourses; wherein he hath so carried himself _ut famosi
Perni amanuensem possis agnoscere_. The Jesuits of England sent over the
book hither to assure them that we are now coming home to them as fast
as we can. I pray God this sin be not deeply laid to their charge, who
give an occasion to our blind thus to stumble' (as before). It was to
these 'Five Discourses' our Poet furnished a 'commendatory' poem--given
by us unmutilated from the volume (vol. i. pp. 162-5). Shelford, like
his friend, was of Peterhouse. Another college-friend was William Herrys
(or Herries or Harris), who was of Essex. He died in October 1631. He
was of Pembroke and Christ's. The poems and 'Epitaph' consecrated to his
memory are in various ways remarkable. But beyond a few college-dates, I
have failed to recover notices of him. He seems to have been to Crashaw
what young King was to Milton and his fellow-students (vol. i. pp.
220-30; vol. ii. pp. 378 et sqq.).[24] So with James Stanninow (or
Staninough), 'fellow of Queene's Colledge'--the poem on whose death was
first printed by us (vol. i. pp. 290-92). He has a Latin poem prefixed
to Isaacson's 'Chronology' (our vol. i. pp. 246-49).[25] So too with
'Master Chambers,' of the fine pathetic hitherto anonymous poem 'Vpon
the death of a Gentleman' (vol. i. pp. 218-19). Neither have I been able
to add one syllable to the name and heading: 'An Epitaph vpon Mr.
Ashton, a conformable citizen.' Wren, Cosin, and others of Cambridge,
not being named by Crashaw, do not come under these remarks. The new
poems on Dr. Porter (vol. i. pp. 293-4), Dr. Mansell (vol. ii. p. 323),
and others, explain themselves--with our notes. Of Cardinal Palotta, or
Palotto, we get most satisfying glimpses in Dr. Bargrave's volume
(already quoted). The Protestant Canon's testimony is: 'He is very
papable [placable], and esteemed worthy by all, especially the princes
that know his virtue and qualities, being a man of angelical life; and
Rome would be glad to see him Pope, to pull down the pride of the
Barberini. Innocent the Xth, now reigning, hath a great regard for him,
though his kindred care not for him, because he speaketh his mind freely
of them to the Pope' (p. 36).[26]

It only remains that I notice our Crashaw's friendship with (_a_)
Abraham Cowley; (_b_) the Countess of Denbigh.

(_a_) ABRAHAM COWLEY. Of the alternate-poem on Hope, composed by Cowley
and Crashaw (vol. i. pp. 175-181), and that 'Vpon two greene Apricockes
sent to Cowley by Sir Crashaw' (ib. pp. 269-70), more in our next
division. These remain as the ever-enduring 'memorial' of their
friendship, while the thought-full, love-full 'Elegy,' devoted by the
survivor to the memory of his Friend, can never pale of its glory (vol.
i. pp. xxxvi.-viii.). All honour to Cowley that he kept the traduced
'Apostate' and 'Revolter' in his heart-of-hearts, and 'sought' him out
in his lowly 'lodgings' in the gay, and yet (to him) sad Paris. It is my
purpose one day worthily to reproduce the Works of this in form
fantastic, but in substance most intellectual, of our Poets; and I shall
have then, perhaps, something additional to communicate on this
beautiful Friendship. They had appeared together as Poets in the 'Voces
Votivae.' The various readings show that Cowley's portion of Hope was
revised in Paris; and this, with the gift of the 'apricockes,' expresses
that they had some pleasant intercourse.[27]

(_b_) COUNTESS OF DENBIGH. By the confiding goodness of the present Earl
and Countess of Denbigh, I have, among my 'Sunny Memories,' most
pleasant hours of a long summer day spent in examining the Library and
family MSS. and portraits at Newnham Paddox, and a continued and
sympathetic correspondence, supplemented with kindred helpfulness on the
part of the good Father-priest of the house. It is one of the anomalies
of our national historic Biography that the sister of Buckingham--Susan,
daughter of Sir George Villiers, of Brokesby, first Countess of
Denbigh--should have died and made no 'sign,' and left no memorial; for
it is absolutely unknown when or where she did die. But as it is known
that _she_ became a Roman Catholic,[28] while it is not known that
Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of Edward Bourchier, Earl of Bath, who
became third wife (of four) of Basil, second Earl of Denbigh, so
'changed,' we must conclude that Turnbull and others are mistaken in
regarding the latter as Crashaw's 'patron' and friend. The family-papers
show that Susan Countess of Denbigh was a lady of intellect and force;
equally do they show that Elizabeth Bourchier was (to say the least)
un-literary. I have from Newnham Paddox a sheaf of rarely-vivid and
valuable Letters of 'Susan'--with some of 'Elizabeth;' and if I can only
succeed in discovering the date of the former's death, so as to
determine whether she was living up to Crashaw's death in 1650, or
thereby--as dowager-countess--I intend to prepare a short Monograph on
her, wherein I shall print, for the first time, such a series of Letters
as will compare with any ever given to the world; and I should greatly
like to engrave her never-yet engraved magnificent face at Newnham
Paddox. For the present, a digression may be allowed, in order to
introduce, as examples of these recovered Letters, a short and
creditable one from Buckingham to his mother, and one from Susan,
Countess of Denbigh, to her son; others, that are long and fact-full,
hereafter (as _supra_). These in order:


I. Buckingham to his Mother [undated]:

    Dere Mother,--Give me but as many blessings and pardons as I shall
    make falts, and then you make happie

  Your most obedient Sonne,

  For my Mother.                          BUCKINGHAM.


II. Susan, Countess of Denbigh, to Lord Fielding:

    My deere Sone,--The king dothe approve well of your going into
    Spane, and for my part I thinke it will be the best of your traviles
    by reson that the king doth discours moust of that plase. I am much
    afflicted for feare of Mr. Mason, but I hope our Lord well send him
    well home againe. I pray do not torment me with your going into the
    danger of the plauge any more. So with my blessing I take my leave.

    Your loveing Mother,

    For my deare Sonne theise.      SU. DENBIGH.


The Verse-Letters to the Countess of Denbigh (vol. i. pp. 295-303) will
be read with renewed interest in the light of the all-but certain fact
that it was Susan, sister of Buckingham--every way a memorable
woman--who was 'persuaded' by Crashaw to 'join' Roman Catholicism, as
did her mother.[29] Reverting to the names which I have endeavoured to
commemorate, where hitherto scarcely anything has been known, it will be
perceived that the circle of Crashaw's friendships was a narrow one, and
touched mainly the two things--his University career, and his great
'change' religiously or rather ecclesiastically. Of the Poets of his
period, except Cowley and Ford, no trace remains as known to or
influential over him. When Crashaw entered Cambridge, Giles Fletcher
had been dead ten years; Phineas Fletcher and Herrick had left about the
same number of years; Herbert, for four or five; and Milton was just
going. His most choice friends were among the mighty dead. Supreme names
later lay outside of his access. I wish he had met--as he might have
done--Milton. I pass next to

III. _His characteristics and place as a Poet._ It is something 'new
under the sun' that it should be our privilege well-nigh to double the
quantity of the extant Poetry of such a Singer as Richard Crashaw, by
printing, for the first time, the treasure-trove of the Sancroft-Tanner
MSS.; and by translating (also for the first time) the whole of his
Latin poetry. Every element of a true poetic faculty that belongs to his
own published Poems is found in the new, while there are new traits
alike of character and genius; and our Translations must be as the
'raising' of the lid of a gem-filled casket, shut to the many for these
(fully) two hundred years. The admirer of Crashaw hitherto has thus his
horizon widened, and I have a kind of feeling that perchance it were
wiser to leave the completed Poetry to make its own impression on those
who come to it. Nevertheless I must, however briefly, fulfil my promise
of an estimate of our Worthy. Four things appear to me to call for
examination, in order to give the essentials of Crashaw as a Poet, and
to gather his main characteristics: (_a_) Imaginative-sensuousness;
(_b_) Subtlety of emotion; (_c_) Epigrams; (_d_) Translations and
(briefly) Latin and Greek Poetry. I would say a little on each.

(_a_) _Imaginative-sensuousness._ Like 'charity' for 'love,' the word
'sensuous' has deteriorated in our day. It is, I fear, more than in
sound and root confused with 'sensual,' in its base application. I use
it as Milton did, in the well-known passage when he defined Poetry to be
'simple, _sensuous_, and passionate;' and I qualify 'sensuousness' with
'imaginative,' that I may express our Poet's peculiar gift of looking at
everything with a full, open, penetrative eye, yet through his
imagination; his imagination not being as spectacles (coloured) astride
the nose, but as a light of white glory all over his intellect and
entire faculties. Only Wordsworth and Shelley, and recently Rossetti and
Jean Ingelow, are comparable with him in this. You can scarcely err in
opening on any page in your out-look for it. The very first poem, 'The
Weeper,' is lustrous with it. For example, what a grand reach of
'imaginative' comprehensiveness have we so early as in the second
stanza, where from the swimming eyes of his 'Magdalene' he was, as it
were, swept upward to the broad transfigured sky in its wild
ever-varying beauty of the glittering silver rain!

    'Heauns thy fair eyes be;
      Heauens of ever-falling starres.
      'Tis seed-time still with thee;
      And starres thou sow'st whose haruest dares
    Promise the Earth to counter-shine
    Whateuer makes heaun's forehead fine.'

How grandly vague is that 'counter-shine _whatever_,' as it leads
upwards to the 'forehead'--superb, awful, God-crowned--of the 'heauns'!
Of the same in kind, but unutterably sweet and dainty also in its
exquisiteness, is stanza vii.:

      'The deaw no more will weep                                _dew_
      The primrose's pale cheek to deck:
      The deaw no more will sleep
      Nuzzel'd in the lily's neck;
    Much rather would it be thy tear,
    And leaue them both to tremble there.'

Wordsworth's vision of the 'flashing daffodils' is not finer than this.
A merely realistic Poet (as John Clare or Bloomfield) would never have
used the glorious singular, 'thy tear,' with its marvellous
suggestiveness of the multitudinous dew regarding itself as outweighed
in everything by one 'tear' of such eyes. Every stanza gives a text for
commentary; and the rapid, crowding questions and replies of the Tears
culminate in the splendid homage to the Saviour in the conclusion,
touched with a gentle scorn:

    'We goe not to seek
      The darlings of Aurora's bed,
      The rose's modest cheek,
      Nor the violet's humble head,
    Though the feild's eyes too Weepers be,
    Because they want such teares as we.
      Much lesse mean to trace
      The fortune of inferior gemmes,
      Preferr'd to some proud face,
      Or pertch't vpon fear'd diadems:
    _Crown'd heads are toyes. We goe to meet_
    A worthy object, our _Lord's feet_.'

'Feet' at highest; mark the humbleness, and the fitness too. Even more
truly than of Donne (in Arthur Wilson's Elegy) may it be said of
Crashaw, here and elsewhere, thou 'Couldst give both life and sense unto
a flower,'--faint prelude of Wordsworth's 'meanest flower.'

Dr. Macdonald (in 'Antiphon') is perplexingly unsympathetic, or, if I
may dare to say it, wooden, in his criticism on 'The Weeper;' for while
he characterises it generally as 'radiant of delicate fancy,' he goes
on: 'but surely such tones are not worthy of flitting moth-like about
the holy sorrow of a repentant woman! Fantastically beautiful, they but
play with her grief. Sorrow herself would put her shoes off her feet in
approaching the weeping Magdalene. They make much of her indeed, but
they show her little reverence. There is in them, notwithstanding their
fervour of amorous words, a coldness, like that which dwells in the
ghostly beauty of icicles shining in the moon' (p. 239). Fundamentally
blundering is all this: for the Critic ought to have marked how the
Poet's 'shoes' are put off his feet in approaching the weeping
Magdalene; but that _she_ is approached as far-back in the Past or in a
Present wherein her tears have been 'wiped away,' so that the poem is
dedicate not so much to The Weeper as to her Tears, as things of beauty
and pricelessness. Mary, 'blessed among women,' is remembered all
through; and just as with her Divine Son we must 'sorrow' in the vision
of His sorrows, we yet have the remembrance that they are all done,
'finished;' and thus we can expatiate on them not with grief so much as
joy. The prolongation of 'The Weeper' is no 'moth-like flitting about
the holy sorrow of a repentant woman,' but the never-to-be-satisfied
rapture over the evidence of a 'godly sorrow' that has worked to
repentance, and in its reward given loveliness and consecration to the
tears shed. The moon 'shining on icicles' is the antithesis of the
truth. Thus is it throughout, as in the backgrounds of the great
Portrait-painters as distinguished from Land-scapists and Sea-scapists
and Sky-scapists--Crashaw inevitably works out his thoughts through
something he has looked at as transfigured by his imagination, so that
you find his most mystical thinking and feeling framed (so to say) with
images drawn from Nature. That he did look not at but into Nature, let
'On a foule Morning, being then to take a Journey,' and 'To the Morning;
Satisfaction for Sleepe,' bear witness. In these there are penetrative
'looks' that Wordsworth never has surpassed, and a richness almost
Shakesperean. Milton must have studied them keenly. There is this
characteristic also in the 'sensuousness' of Crashaw, that while the
Painter glorifies the ignoble and the coarse (as Hobbima's Asses and
red-cloaked Old Women) in introducing it into a scene of Wood, or
Way-side, or Sea-shore, his outward images and symbolism are worthy in
themselves, and stainless as worthy (passing exceptions only
establishing the rule). His epithets are never superfluous, and are,
even to surprising nicety, true. Thus he calls Egypt '_white_ Egypt'
(vol. i. p. 81); and occurring as this does 'In the glorious Epiphanie
of ovr Lord God,' we are reminded again how the youthful Milton must
have had this extraordinary composition in his recollection when he
composed his immortal Ode.[30] Similarly we have '_hir'd_ mist' (vol. i.
p. 84); '_pretious_ losse' (ib.); '_fair-ey'd_ fallacy of Day' (ib. p.
85); '_black_ but faithfull perspectiue of Thee' (ib. p. 86); '_abased_
liddes' (ib. p. 88); '_gratious_ robbery' (ib. p. 156); 'thirsts of
loue' (ib.); '_timerous_ light of starres' (ib. p. 172); '_rebellious_
eye of Sorrow' (ib. p. 112); and so in hundreds of parallels. Take this
from 'To the Name above every Name' (ib. p. 60):

            'O come away ...
    O, see the weary liddes of wakefull Hope--
    Love's eastern windowes--all wide ope
            With curtains drawn,
    To catch the day-break of Thy dawn.
    O, dawn at last, long-lookt-for Day,
    Take thine own wings, and come away.'

Comparing Cowley's and Crashaw's 'Hope,' Coleridge thus pronounces on
them: 'Crashaw seems in his poems to have given the first ebullience of
his imagination, unshapen into form, or much of what we now term
sweetness. In the poem Hope, by way of question and answer, his
superiority to Cowley is self-evident;' and he continues, 'In that on
the Name of Jesus, equally so; but his lines on St. Teresa are the
finest.' 'Where he does combine richness of thought and diction, nothing
can excel, as in the lines you so much admire,

    Since 'tis not to be had at home
           .       .       .       .       .
    She'l to the Moores and martyrdom.'[31]

And then as never-to-be-forgotten 'glory' of the Hymn to Teresa, he
adds: 'these verses were ever present to my mind whilst writing the
second part of the Christabel; if indeed, by some subtle process of the
mind, they did not suggest the first thought of the whole poem'
(Letters and Conversations, 1836, i. 196). Coleridge makes another
critical remark which it may be worth while to adduce and perhaps
qualify. 'Poetry as regards small Poets may be said to be, in a certain
sense, conventional in its accidents and in its illustrations. Thus
[even] Crashaw uses an image "as sugar melts in tea away;" which
although _proper then_ and _true now_, was in bad taste at that time
equally with the present. In Shakespeare, in Chaucer, there was nothing
of this' (as before). The great Critic forgot that 'sugar' and 'tea'
were not vulgarised by familiarity when Crashaw wrote, that the wonder
and romance of their gift from the East still lay around them, and that
their use was select, not common. Thus later I explain Milton's
homeliness of allusion, as in the word 'breakfast,' and 'fell to,' and
the like; words and places and things that have long been not prosaic
simply, but demeaned and for ever unpoetised. I am not at all careful to
defend the 'sugar' and 'tea' metaphor; but it, I think, belongs also to
his imaginative-sensuousness, whereby orient awfulness almost, magnified
and dignified it to him.

Moreover the canon in 'Antiphon' is sound: 'When we come, in the
writings of one who has revealed master-dom, upon any passage that seems
commonplace, or any figure that suggests nothing true, the part of
wisdom is to brood over that point; for the probability is that the
barrenness lies in us, two factors being necessary for the result of
sight--the thing to be seen, and the eye to see it. No doubt the
expression may be inadequate; but if we can compensate the deficiency by
adding more vision, so much the better for us' (p. 243).

I thank Dr. George Macdonald[32] (in 'Antiphon') for his quaint opening
words on our Crashaw, and forgive him, for their sake, his blind reading
of 'The Weeper.' 'I come now to one of the loveliest of our angel-birds,
Richard Crashaw. Indeed, he was like a bird in more senses than one; for
he belongs to that class of men who seem hardly ever to get foot-hold of
this world, but are ever floating in the upper air of it' (p. 238).
True, and yet not wholly; or rather, if our Poet ascends to 'the upper
air,' and sings there with all the divineness of the skylark, like the
skylark his eyes fail not to over-watch the nest among the grain
beneath, nor his wings to be folded over it at the shut of eve.
Infinitely more, then, is to be found in Crashaw than Pope (in his
Letter to his friend Henry Cromwell) found: 'I take this poet to have
writ like a gentleman; that is, at leisure hours, and more to keep out
of idleness than to establish a reputation: so that nothing regular or
just can be expected of him. All that regards design, form, fable (which
is the soul of poetry), all that concerns exactness, or consent of parts
(which is the body), will probably be wanting; only pretty conceptions,
fine metaphors, glittering expressions, and something of a neat cast of
verse (which are properly the dress, gems, or loose ornaments of
poetry), may be found in these verses.' Nay verily, the form is often
exquisite; but 'neat' and 'pretty conceptions' applied to such verse is
as 'pretty' applied to Niagara--so full, strong, deep, thought-laden is
it. I have no wish to charge plagiarism on Pope from Crashaw, as
Peregrine Phillips did (see onward); but neither is the contemptuous as
ignorant answer by a metaphor of Hayley to be received. The two minds
were essentially different: Pope was talented, and used his talents to
the utmost; Crashaw had absolute as unique genius.[33]

(_b_) _Subtlety of emotion._ Dr. Donne, in a memorable passage, with
daring originality, sings of Mrs. Drury rapturously:

                  'Her pure and eloquent soul
    Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,
    That one might almost say her body thought.'

I have much the same conception of Crashaw's thinking. It was so
emotional as almost always to tremble into feeling. Bare intellect,
'pure' (= naked) thought, you rarely come on in his Poems. The thought
issues forth from (in old-fashioned phrase) the heart, and its subtlety
is something unearthly even to awfulness. Let the reader give hours to
the study of the composition entitled 'In the glorious Epiphanie of ovr
Lord God, a Hymn svng as by the three Kings,' and 'In the holy Nativity
of ovr Lord God.' Their depth combined with elevation, their grandeur
softening into loveliness, their power with pathos, their awe bursting
into rapture, their graciousness and lyrical music, their variety and
yet unity, will grow in their study. As always, there is a solid
substratum of original thought in them; and the thinking, as so often in
Crashaw, is surcharged with emotion. If the thought may be likened to
fire, the praise, the rapture, the yearning may be likened to flame
leaping up from it. Granted that, as in fire and flame, there are
coruscations and jets of smoke, yet is the smoke that 'smoak' of which
Chudleigh in his Elegy for Donne sings:

    'Incense of love's and fancie's _holy smoak_;'

or, rather, that 'smoke' which filled the House to the vision of Isaiah
(vi. 4). The hymn 'To the admirable Sainte Teresa,' and the 'Apologie'
for it, and related 'Flaming Heart,' and 'In the glorious Assvmption of
our Blessed Lady,' are of the same type. Take this from the 'Flaming
Heart' (vol. i. p. 155):

    'Leaue her ... the flaming heart:
    Leaue her that, and thou shalt leaue her
    Not one loose shaft, but Loue's whole quiver.
    _For in Loue's feild was neuer found
    A nobler weapon than a wovnd._
    Loue's passiues are his actiu'st part,
    The wounded is the wounding heart.
           .       .       .       .       .
    Liue here, great heart; and loue and dy and kill,
    And bleed and wound; and yeild and conquer still.'

His homage to the Virgin is put into words that pass the bounds which we
Protestants set to the 'blessed among women' in her great renown, and
even while a Protestant Crashaw fell into what we must regard as the
strange as inexplicable forgetfulness that it is The _Man_, not The
Child, who is our ever-living High-Priest 'within the veil,' and that
not in His mother's bosom, but on the Throne of sculptured light, is His
place. Still, you recognise that the homage to the Virgin-mother is to
the Divine Son through her, and through her in fine if also mistaken
humility. 'Mary' is the Muse of Crashaw; the Lord Jesus his 'Lord' and
hers. I would have the reader spend willing time, in slowly,
meditatively reading the whole of our Poet's sacred Verse, to note how
the thinking thus thrills into feeling, and feeling into rapture--the
rapture of adoration. It is miraculous how he finds words wherewith to
utter his most subtle and vanishing emotion. Sometimes there is a
daintiness and antique richness of wording that you can scarcely equal
out of the highest of our Poets, or only in them. Some of his images
from Nature are scarcely found anywhere else. For example, take this
very difficult one of ice, in the Verse-Letter to the Countess of
Denbigh (vol. i. p. 298, ll. 21-26), 'persuading' her no longer to be
the victim of her doubts:

      'So, when the Year takes cold, we see
      Poor waters _their own prisoners be;
      Fetter'd and lock'd-up fast they lie
      In a cold self-captivity_.
    Th' astonish'd Nymphs their Floud's strange fate deplore,
    To find themselves their own severer shoar.'

Young is striking in his use of the ice-metaphor:

                  'in Passion's flame
    Hearts melt; but _melt like ice, soon harder froze_.'

  (Night-Thoughts, N. II. l. 522-3.)

But how strangely original is the earlier Poet in so cunningly working
it into the very matter of his persuasion! Our quotation from Young
recalls that in the 'Night-Thoughts' there are evident reminiscences of
Crashaw: _e.g._

                  'Midnight veil'd his face:
    Not such as this, not such as Nature makes;
    A midnight Nature shudder'd to behold;
    A midnight new; a dread eclipse, without
    Opposing spheres, from her Creator's frown.'

  (Night IV. ll. 246-250.)

So in 'Gilt was Hell's gloom' (N. VII. l. 1041), and in this portrait of
Satan:

    'Like meteors in a stormy sky, how roll
    His baleful eyes!'       (N. IX. ll. 280-1.) and

                  'the fiery gulf,
    That flaming bound of wrath omnipotent;'  (Ib. ll. 473-4)

and

    'Banners streaming as the comet's blaze;' (Ib. l. 323)

and

    'Which makes a hell of hell,' (Ib. l. 340)

we have the impress and inspiration of our Poet.

How infinitely soft and tender and Shakesperean is the 'Epitaph vpon a
yovng Married Covple dead and bvryed together' (with its now restored
lines), thus!--

    'Peace, good Reader, doe not weep;
    Peace, the louers are asleep.
    They, sweet turtles, folded ly
    In the last knott that Loue could ty.
    And though they ly as they were dead,
    Their pillow stone, their sheetes of lead
    (Pillow hard, and sheetes not warm),
    Loue made the bed; they'l take no harm:
    Let them sleep; let them sleep on,
    Till this stormy night be gone,
    And the aeternall morrow dawn;
    Then ...' (vol. i. pp. 230-1.)

The hush, the tranquil stillness of a church-aisle, within which 'sleep'
old recumbent figures, comes over one in reading these most pathetically
beautiful words. Of the whole poem, Dodd in his 'Epigrammatists' (as
onward) remarks, 'after reading this Epitaph, all others on the same
subject must suffer by comparison. Yet there is much to be admired in
the following by Bishop Hall, on Sir Edward and Lady Lewkenor. It is
translated from the Latin by the Bishop's descendant and editor, the
Rev. Peter Hall (Bp. Hall's Works, 1837-9, xii. 331):

    'In bonds of love united, man and wife,
    Long, yet too short, they spent a happy life;
    United still, too soon, however late,
    Both man and wife receiv'd the stroke of fate:
    And now in glory clad, enraptur'd pair,
    The same bright cup, the same sweet draught they share.
    Thus, first and last, a married couple see,
    In life, in death, in immortality.'

There is much beauty also in an anonymous epitaph in the 'Festoon' 143,
'On a Man and his Wife:'

    'Here sleep, whom neither life nor love,
      Nor friendship's strictest tie,
    Could in such close embrace as thou,
      Their faithful grave, ally;
    Preserve them, each dissolv'd in each,
      For bands of love divine,
    For union only more complete,
      Thou faithful grave, than thine.' (p. 253.)

His 'Wishes to his (supposed) Mistresse' has things in it vivid and
subtle as anything in Shelley at his best; and I affirm this
deliberately. His little snatch on 'Easter Day' with some peculiarities,
culminates in a grandeur Milton might bow before. The version of 'Dies
Irae' is wonderfully severe and solemn and intense. Roscommon
undoubtedly knew it. And so we might go on endlessly. His melody--with
exceptional discords--is as the music of a Master, not mere
versification. Once read receptively, and the words haunt almost
awfully, and, I must again use the word, unearthlily. Summarily--as in
our claim for Vaughan, as against the preposterous traditional
assertions of his indebtedness to Herbert poetically, while really it
was for spiritual benefits he was obligated--we cannot for an instant
rank George Herbert as a Poet with Crashaw. Their piety is alike, or the
'Priest' of Bemerton is more definite, and clear of the 'fine mist' of
mysticism of the recluse of 'Little St. Mary's;' but only very rarely
have you in 'The Temple' that light of genius which shines as a very
Shekinah-glory in the 'Steps to the Temple.' These 'Steps' have been
spoken of as 'Steps' designed to lead into Herbert's 'Temple,' whereas
they were 'Steps' to the 'Temple' or Church of the Living God. Crashaw
'sang' sweetly and generously of Herbert (vol. i. pp. 139-140); but the
two Poets are profoundly distinct and independent. Clement Barksdale,
probably, must bear the blame of foolishly subordinating Crashaw to
Herbert, in his Lines in 'Nympha Libethris' (1651):


'HERBERT AND CRASHAW.


    When unto Herbert's Temple I ascend
    By Crashaw's Steps, I do resolve to mend
    My lighter verse, and my low notes to raise,
    And in high accent sing my Maker's praise.
    Meanwhile these sacred poems in my sight
    I place, that I may learn to write.'

(_c_) _Epigrams._ The title-page of the Epigr. Sacra of 1670 marks out
for us their main dates; that is to say, as it designates him 'Collegii
Petrensis Socius,' which he was not until 1637, the only portion that
belongs to that period must be the additions made in the 1670 edition
(see vol. ii. pp. 3-4). Dr. Macdonald (in 'Antiphon') observes: 'His
Divine Epigrams are not the most beautiful, but they are to me the most
valuable, of his verses, inasmuch as they make us feel afresh the truth
which he sets forth anew. In them some of the facts of our Lord's life
and teaching look out upon us as from clear windows of the Past. As
epigrams, too, they are excellent--pointed as a lance' (p. 240). He
limits himself to the 'English' Epigrams, and quotes after above, Nos.
LIV. (2) and XI.; and continues with No. XIV., and next LIV. (1); on
which he says: 'I value the following as a lovely parable. Mary is not
contented; to see the place is little comfort. The church itself, with
all its memories of the Lord, the Gospel-story, and all theory about
Him, is but His tomb until we find Himself;' and he closes with one
which he thinks is 'perhaps his best,' viz. No. I.[34] We too may give
it:

      '_Two went up into the Temple to pray._
    Two went to pray! O, rather say,
    One went to brag, th' other to pray.
    One stands up close, and treads on high,
    Where th' other dares not send his eye.
    One neerer to God's altar trod;
    The other to the altar's God.' (vol. ii. p. 35.)

The admiring critic on this proceeds: 'This appears to me perfect. Here
is the true relation between the forms and the end of religion. The
priesthood, the altar and all its ceremonies, must vanish from between
the sinner and his God. When the priest forgets his mediation of a
servant, his duty of a door-keeper to the temple of truth, and takes
upon him the office of an intercessor, he stands between man and God,
and is a satan, an adversary. Artistically considered, the poem could
hardly be improved' (p. 241). 'Artistically,' nevertheless, it is a
wonder Dr. Macdonald did not detect Turnbull's mis-reading of 'lend' for
'send' (l. 4). Bellew in his Poet's Corner reads 'bend,' which is
equally poor for 'tendit.' There follows No. XLII., 'containing a
similar lesson;' and finally No. XLV. p. 196, whereof he says: 'The
following is a world-wide intercession for them that know not what they
do. Of those that reject the truth, who can be said ever to have truly
seen it? A man must be good to see truth. It is a thought suggested by
our Lord's words, not an irreverent opposition to the truth of them'
(p. 242).

Now that, besides the (relatively) few Epigrams which were translated by
Crashaw himself, the whole are translated (for the first time), and now
too that, exclusive of longer Latin poems, a goodly addition has been
made by us to them, the reader will find it rewarding to turn and return
on this remarkable section of Crashaw's poetry. Conceits there are,
grotesque as gargoyles of a cathedral, oddities of symbolism, even
passing into unconscious playing with holy words and things never to be
played with; but each has a jewel of a distinct thought or sentiment,
and often the wording is felicitous, albeit, as in all his Latin verse,
not invariably without technical faults of quantity and even syntax. I
had marked very many for specific criticism; but I must refrain. Our
translation is perhaps a better commentary. To my co-workers and myself
it has been a labour of love. I must close our notice of Crashaw as an
Epigrammatist with some parallels from 'The Epigrammatists' of the Rev.
Henry Philip Dodd, M.A. (1870). Under No. CXVII., 'On Pontius Pilate
washing his hands,' he has this: 'In Elsum's Epigrams on Paintings,
1700, is one on a picture by Andrea Sacchi of Pilate washing his hands,
translated from Michael Silos, De Romana Pictura et Sculptura' (Ep. 17):

    'O cursed Pilate, villain dyed in grain,
    A little water cannot purge thy stain;
    No, Tanais can't do't, nor yet the main.
    Dost thou condemn a Deity to death,
    Him whose mere love gave and preserv'd thy breath?'

Similarly, under No. LI. 'On the Blessed Virgin's Bashfulness,' he has
this: 'Some lines "To the Blessed Virgin at her Purification," by the
old epigrammatist Bancroft, are almost as beautiful in sentiment as
this exquisite piece (Book ii. 86):

    Why, favourite of Heaven, most fair,
    Dost thou bring fowls for sacrifice?
    Will not the armful thou dost bear,
    That lovely Lamb of thine, suffice?'

Of the exceptionally celebrated, not exceptionally superior Epigram on
'The Water turned Wine,' which somehow has been given by a perverse
continued blunder to Dryden, Aaron Hill's masterly translation may be
read along with those given by us in the place (vol. ii. pp. 96-7):

    'When Christ at Cana's feast by pow'r divine
    Inspir'd cold water with the warmth of wine;
    See! cried they, while in red'ning tide it gush'd,
    The bashful stream hath seen its God, and _blush'd_.'

Dryden's 'The conscious water saw its God, and blush'd,' is a mere
remembrance of Crashaw.[35]

(_d_) _Translations and (briefly) Latin and Greek Poetry._ It may seem
semi-paradoxical to affirm it, but in our opinion the genius of Crashaw
shines with its fullest splendour in his Translations, longer and
shorter. Even were there not his wonderful 'Suspicion of Herod' and
'Musick's Duell,' this might be said; for in his 'Dies Irae,' and
'Hymne out of Sainte Thomas,' and others lesser, there are felicities
that only a genuine Maker could have produced. His 'Dies Irae' was the
earliest version in our language. Roscommon and Scott alike wrote after
and 'after' it. But it is on the two truly great Poems named we found
our estimate. Turning to 'Musick's Duell,' as we ask the reader to do
now (vol. i. 197-203), we have only to read critically the Latin of
Strada, from whence it is drawn, to discern the creative gift of our
Poet. Here it is:

    Jam Sol a medio pronus deflexerat orbe
    Mitius, e radiis vibrans crinalibus ignem.
    Cum Fidicen, propter Tiberina fluenta, sonanti
    Lenibat plectra curas, aestumque levabat,
    Ilice defensus nigra scenaque virenti.
    Audiit hunc hospes silvae Philomela propinquae
    Musa loci, nemoris siren, innoxia siren;
    Et prope succedens stetit abdita frondibus, alte
    Accipiens sonitum, secumque remurmurat, et quos
    Ille modos variat digitis, haec gutture reddit.
    Sensit se Fidicen Philomela imitante referri,
    Et placuit ludum volucri dare; plenius ergo
    Explorat citharam, tentamentumque futurae
    Praebeat ut pugnae, percussit protinus omnes
    Impulsu pernice fides, nec segnius illa.
    Mille per excurrens variae discrimina vocis,
    Venturi specimen praefert argutula cantus.
    Tunc Fidicen per fila movens trepidantia dextram,
    Nunc contemnenti similis diverberat ungue,
    Depectitque pari chordas, et simplice ductu:
    Nunc carptim replicat, digitisque micantibus urget
    Fila minutatim, celerique repercutit ictu.
    Mox silet. Illa modis totidem respondet, et artem
    Arte refert. Nunc seu rudis aut incerta canendi
    Projicit in longum, nulloque plicatile flexu
    Carmen init, simili serie, jugique tenore,
    Praebet iter liquidum labenti e pectore voce;
    Nunc caesim variat, modulisque canora minutis.
    Delibrat vocem, tremuloque reciprocat ore.
    Miratur Fidicen parvis e faucibus ire
    Tam varium, tam dulce melos; majoraque tentans
    Alternat mira arte fides; dum torquet acutas
    Inciditque, graves operoso verbere pulsat,
    Permiscetque simul certantia rauca sonoris,
    Ceu resides in bella viros clangore lacessat.
    Hoc etiam Philomela canit: dumque ore liquenti
    Vibrat acuta sonum, modulisque interplicat acquis;
    Ex inopinato gravis intonat, et leve murmur
    Turbinat introrsus, alternantique sonore
    Clarat, et infuscat ceu martia classica pulset.
    Scilicet erubuit Fidicen, ...
    Non imitabilibus plectrum concentibus urget.
    Namque manu per fila volat, simul hos, simul illos
    Explorat numeros, chordaque laborat in omni,
    Et strepit, et tinnit, crescitque superbius, et se
    Multiplicat religens, plenoque choreumate plaudit.[36]

It will be noted by the student that such word-painting as in these
lines belongs to Crashaw, not Strada:

                            'and streightway she
    _Carves out her dainty voyce as readily_.
           .       .       .       .       .
    Through the sleeke passage of her open throat
    _A clear unwrinckled song_;
           .       .       .       .       .
          closes the sweet quarrell, rowsing all,
    _Hoarce, shrill at once; as when the trumpets call
    Hot Mars to th' harvest of Death's field, and woo
    Men's hearts into their hands_:'
           .       .       .       .       .
                      staggers in a warbling doubt
    _Of dallying sweetnesse_, hovers o'er her skill,
    _And folds in wav'd notes with a trembling bill_
           .       .       .       .       .
                                              a tide
    Of streaming sweetnesse, _which in state doth ride
    On the wav'd backe of every swelling straine,
    Rising and falling in a pompous traine_.
           .       .       .       .       .
    Thus high, thus low, _as if her silver throat
    Would reach the brazen voyce of War's hoarce bird_.

        ... his hands sprightly as fire, he flings
    And with _a quavering coynesse tasts the strings_.
    The sweet-lip't sisters, musically frighted,
    Singing their feares, are fearefully delighted,
    _Trembling as when Appolo's golden haires
    Are fan'd and frizled, in the wanton ayres
    Of his own breath: which marryed to his lyre_

           .       .       .       .       .
    _The lute's light genius now does proudly rise,

           .       .       .       .       .
    _Creeps on the soft touch of a tender tone_.'

In the words of Willmott (as before), 'We shall seek in vain in the
Latin text for the vigour, the fancy, and the grandeur of these lines.
These remain with Crashaw, of whose obligations to Strada we may say, as
Hayley [stupidly, if picturesquely] remarked of Pope's debt to Crashaw,
that if he borrowed anything from him in this article, it was only as
the sun borrows from the earth, when, drawing from thence a mere vapour,
he makes it the delight of every eye, by giving it all the tender and
gorgeous colouring of heaven' (vol. i. p. 323). The richness and fulness
of our Poet as a Translator becomes the more clear when we place beside
his interpretation of Strada the 'translations' of others, as given in
the places (vol. i. pp. 203-6). A third (anonymous) version we
discovered among the Lansdowne MSS. 3910, pt. lxvi., from which we take
a specimen:

    'Now the declininge sunn 'gan downward bende
    From higher heauene, and from his locks did sende
    A milder flame; when neere to Tyber's flowe
    A Lutaniste allayde his carefull woe,
    With sondinge charmes, and in a greeny seate
    Of shady oake, toke shelter from the heate.

      A nitingale ore-hard hym that did use
    To soiourne in y^e neighbour groues, the Muse
    That files the place, the syren of the wood:
    Poore harmeles Syren, steling neere she stood
    Close lurkinge in the leaues attentiuely:
    Recordinge that vnwonted mellodye,
    She condt it to herselfe, and every straine
    His fingers playde, her throat return'd againe.'

And so to the end (MS. 3910, pp. 114-17). We have reserved until now
incomparably the second, but only a far-off second, to Crashaw's, from
John Ford's 'Lover's Melancholy' (1629); which probably was our Poet's
guide to Strada. Here is the substance of the fine reminiscent version,
from act i. scene 1:

    _Menaphon._ A sound of music touched mine ears, or rather,
    Indeed, entranced my soul. As I stole nearer,
    Invited by the melody, I saw
    This youth, this fair-faced youth, upon his lute,
    With strains of strange variety and harmony,
    Proclaiming, as it seemed, so bold a challenge
    To the clear choristers of the wood, the birds,
    That as they flocked about him all stood silent,
    Wondering at what they heard. I wondered too.

    _Amethus._ And do so I: good, on.

    _Men._                            A nightingale,
    Nature's best-skilled musician, undertakes
    The challenge, and for every several strain
    The well-shaped youth could touch, she sung her own:
    He could not run division with more art
    Vpon his quaking instrument than she
    The nightingale did with her various notes
    Reply to: for a voice and for a sound,
    Amethus, 'tis much easier to believe
    That such they were, than hope to hear again.

    _Ameth._ How did the rivals part?

    _Men._                            You term them rightly.
    For they were rivals, and their mistress, Harmony.
    Some time thus spent, the young man grew at last
    Into a pretty anger, that a bird,
    Whom art had never taught cliffs, moods, or notes,
    Should vie with him for mastery, whose study
    Had busied many hours to perfect practice.
    To end the controversy, in a rapture,
    Vpon his instrument he plays so swiftly
    So many voluntaries, and so quick,
    That there was curiosity and cunning,
    Concord in discord, lines of differing method
    Meeting in one full centre of delight.

    _Ameth._ Now for the bird.

    _Men._                     The bird, ordained to be
    Music's first master, strove to imitate
    These several sounds; which when her warbling throat
    Failed in, for grief down dropped she on his lute,
    And brake her heart. It was the quaintest sadness,
    To see the conqueror upon her hearse
    To weep.[37]

Comment is needless on such pale, empty literality, as compared with the
vitality and _elan_ of Crashaw, in all but Ford's; while even Ford's is
surpassed in every way by the 'Musick's Duell.'

The 'Suspicion of Herod,' by Marino (c. i.), is a grand poem in the
original. Milton knew it, and was taken by it. Our Poet had glorious
materials whereon to work, accordingly, when he turned Translator of
this all-too-little known Singer of Italy. But Crashaw's soul was more
spacious, his imagination more imperial, his vocabulary wealthier, than
even Marino's. The greatness and grandeur and force of the Italian
roused the Englishman to emulation. Willmott (as before) has placed the
original Italian beside Crashaw's interpretation, and the advance in the
Translator on his original is almost startling. We prefer adducing
Crashaw, and then giving a close rendering of the original: _e.g._

    'He saw Heav'n blossome with a new-borne light,
    _On which, as on a glorious stranger, gaz'd
    The golden eyes of Night_.'      (st. xvii.)

literally in Marino:

    '_He sees also shining from heaven,
    With beauteous ray, the wondrous star_,
    Which, brilliant and beautiful, goes
    Pointing the way straight towards Bethlehem.'

Again:

    'He saw how in that blest Day-bearing Night,
    The Heav'n-rebuked shades made hast away;
    _How bright a dawne of angels with new light
    Amaz'd the midnight world, and made a Day
    Of which the Morning knew not_.'      (st. xv.)

literally in Marino:

    'He sees the quiet shades and the dark
    Horrors of the happy, holy Night
    Smitten and routed by heavenly voices,
    And vanquished by angelic splendours.'

Once more: when Alecto, the most terrible of the infernal sisters,
ascends to Earth at the command of Satan:

    'Heav'n saw her rise, and saw Hell in the sight:
    The fields' faire eyes saw her, and saw no more,
    But shut their flowry lids for ever;'      (st. xlviii.)

for

    'Parvero i fiori intorno e la verdura
    Sentir forza di peste, ira di verno;'

literally:

          'soon as Hell had vomited out
    This monster from the dark abyss,
    _The flowers all around and the verdure appeared
    To feel the strength of the plague, the fury of winter_.'

This naked simplicity of wording is very fine: yet do Crashaw's
adornments bring new charm to Marino. The soliloquy of Satan, though
close as the skin to the body, has a ruddiness (so-to-say) from
Crashaw. Nothing in Milton is grander than st. xxv. to xxx.; and in all
there are touches from the cunning hand of Crashaw: _e.g._

    '_And for the never-fading fields of light;_'      (st. xxvii.)

for Marino's

    'Che piu puo farmi omai chi la celeste
    _Reggia mi tolse, e i regni i miei lucenti_?'

literally:

    'What more can He now do to me, Who took
    _From me the heavenly palace and my bright realms_?'

Again:

    '_Bow our bright heads before a king of clay;_'      (st. xxviii.)

for Marino's

    'Volle alle forme sue semplici e prime,
    Natura sovralzar corporea e bassa,
    E de' membri del ciel capo sublime
    Far di limo terrestre eterna massa;'

literally:

    'He turns to his simple primitive forms,
    To raise Nature above the corporeal and low,
    And to make an unworthy mass of earthly clay
    The sublime head of the heavenly members.'

Compare also st. x. in Crashaw with the original as literally rendered:

    'Disdainefull wretch, how hath one bold sinne cost
    Thee all the beauties of thy once bright eyes!
    How hath _one black eclipse cancell'd and crost
    The glories that did gild thee in thy rise!
    Proud morning of a perverse day_, how lost
    Art thou unto thy selfe, thou too selfe-wise
      Narcissus! foolish Phaeton, who for all
      Thy _high-aym'd hopes, gaind'st but a flaming fall_.'

Literally in Marino:

    'O wretched Angel, once fairer than light,
    How thou hast lost thy primeval splendour!
    Thou shalt have from the eternal Requiter
    Deserved punishment for the unjust crime:
    Proud admirer of thy honours,
    Rebellious usurper of another's seat!
    Transformed, and fallen into Phlegethon,
    Proud Narcissus, impious Phaethon!'

Milton takes from Crashaw, not Marino, in his portrait of the Destroyer:

    'From Death's sad shades to the life-breathing ayre
    This mortall enemy to mankind's good
    Lifts his _malignant eyes, wasted with care,
    To become beautifull in humane blood_.'      (st. xi.)

Literally in Marino:

    'He from the shades of death to the living air,
    Envious in truth of our human state,
    Lifted aloft his eyes by where
    The hollow vent-hole opened straight down.'

Well-nigh innumerable single lines and words are inevitably marked:
_e.g._

                        'the rebellious eye
    Of sorrow.'      (st. xlix.)

So the eyes of Satan:

            'the sullen dens of Death and Night
    Startle the dull ayre with a dismal red;'      (st. vii.)

for Marino's

    'Negli occhi ove mestizia alberga e morte,
    Luce fiammeggia torbida e vermiglia;'

literally:

    'In the eyes where sadness dwells and death
    A turbid vermilion-coloured light shines.'

Again: the sun is seen by the Tempter to

    Make proud the ruby portalls of the East;'      (st. xvi.)

for 'la Reggia Oriental.' Crashaw has the same vivid fancy in the Hymn
for Epiphany:

          'Aurora shall set ope
    Her ruby casements.'

Finally, to show that even where our Translator keeps closest to the
original, he yet gives the creative touches of which I have already
spoken, read his st. v. beside this literal translation:

    'Under the abysses, at the very core of the world,
    In the central point of the universe,
    Within the bowers of the darkest deep,
    There stands the fiendly perverse Spirit:
    With sharp thongs an impure group
    Binds him with a hundred snakes athwart:
    With such bonds girds him for ever,
    The great champion who conquered HIM in Paradise.'

Thus we might go over the entire poem, and everywhere we should gather
proofs that he was himself all he conceived in his splendid portraiture
of the true Poet's genius:

          'no rapture makes it live
    Drest in the glorious madnesse of a Muse,
    Whose feet can walke the Milky Way,
    Her starry throne, and hold up an exalted arm
    To lift me from my lazy urn and climbe
    Upon the stooped shoulders of old Time,
    And trace eternity.'      (vol. i. p. 238.)[38]

Fully to estimate Crashaw's own grander imaginative faculty the Reader
must study here the now-first-printed and very Miltonic poems on
Apocalypse xii. 7 (Vol. II. pp. 231-3) and 'Christe, veni' (_ib._ pp.
223-5). It is profoundly to be regretted that our Poet should have
limited himself to Book I. of the 'Strage degli Innocenti,' viz.
'Sospetto d'Herode.' Book VII. especially, 'Della Gerusalemme Distruta,'
would have demanded all his powers. The entire poem was 'done in
English,' and it is '_done_' (by T.R. 1675).

With reference to our own Translations of Crashaw, if in some instances
we have enlarged on our original, and adventured to fill-in what in the
Latin the Poet is fettered in uttering, may we apologise by pleading his
own example as a Translator, though with unequal steps and far off? I
would specify the very remarkable 'Bulla,' in which, indeed, I find
Crashaw's highest of pure poetic faculty within the region of Fancy in
its delicatest and subtlest symbolisms; also the scarcely less
remarkable address 'To the Reader' ('Lectori'); and his 'Fides &c. &c.'
and his classical legends of 'Arion,' and his University 'Laments' and
'Appeals' for Peterhouse. Throughout, my co-workers and myself have
aimed to give the _thought_ of Crashaw; and, unless I egregiously
mistake, we have together earned some gratitude from admirers of our
Worthy.

I leave to other Scholars to deal critically with the Latin and Greek of
these Poems and Epigrams now first translated. Read unsympathetically, I
fear that very often his quantities and versification will be regarded
as barbarous; but we have done something, it is believed, to neutralise
Turnbull's most discreditable misprints herein, as in the English Poems.
In the places (vol. ii. pp. 5-6, 244, and 332) we have recorded some of
his more flagrant blunders; but besides we have silently corrected as
many more of the original and early editions.

That Crashaw was not an accurate scholar the Greek Epigrams (as well as
some of the Latin ones) furnish sufficient proof. Of the many obvious
errors in quantity and construction, I have only corrected such as may
have been mere oversights, some of them perhaps caused by his MS. having
been misread; in other cases I have followed the original editions, and
corrected the numerous errors made by Turnbull from his not being able
to read the Greek ligatures &c. It may be well to indicate a few of the
typical corrections that I felt obliged to make, and note other lapses
which I did not feel justified in altering.

    In XI. last line, {aperrhipton} for {aporrhipton}; CXXI. last line,
    {een} for {ee}; CXXV. line 5. {kein'} for {kein}; CLXXX. line 1 has
    {plane} as if the penult were long instead of short, and {alemi} an
    unused form, so that the line offends both quantity and usage--it
    might be amended thus, {Heis men ego, he mou te plane periegen,
    alomai}; CLXXXII. line 1, {epeballen} for {epiballen}; CLXXXIII.
    line 2, {sykomore} should be {sykomore}, but altered for scansion;
    line 3, {ekkremnes} should perhaps be {ekkremnas}; line 4,
    unscanable; and in CXXV. line 4, {dasiois} should be {dasesin}.
    {ouranos}, the penult of which is short, he uses as either long or
    short.

I must add, that the accentuation was as often wrong as right. I have
carefully corrected it throughout. And this seems to me to be the only
allowable way of reproducing Crashaw. An Editor cannot be held
responsible for his Author writing imperfect Greek or Latin, any more
than for his mistakes either in opinion or in matters-of-fact or taste.

Anderson's and Chalmers' Poets, and Peregrine Phillip's Selections, and
Turnbull's edition in Russell Smith's 'Old Authors' and that in
Gilfillan's Poets (a selection only), are our predecessors in furnishing
Crashaw's Poetry. We confess to a feeling of just pride (shall we say?)
in being the first worthily and adequately to present as remarkable
Poetry, in its own region, as is anywhere to be found. RICHARD CRASHAW
has assuredly not yet gathered all his fame.[39]

NOTE.

    The earliest appearance of CRASHAW as a poet was in the University
    Collections of Latin Verse on the (then) usual conventional
    occasions of royal births and deaths, and the like. These pieces
    will be found in their places in the present volume. The place of
    honour herein we assign to his own published volume of 1634, of
    which the following is the title-page, within a neat woodcut border:




  EPIGRAM-

  MATUM

  SACRORUM

  LIBER.


  University Printer's ornament,
  with legend, 'Hinc. Lvcem. Et.
  Pocula. Sacra.' and 'Alma Mater.'


  Cantabrigiae,
  Ex Academiae celeberrimae
  typographeo. 1634.

    This is a small duodecimo. Collation: Title-page--Epistle-dedicatory
    to LANY, with the poems, 'Salve, alme custos Pierii gregis,'
    &c.--Venerabili viro Magistro Tournay, Tutori suo summe
    observando--Ornatissimo viro Praeceptori suo colendissimo, Magistro
    Brook--Lectori (verse and prose), seven leaves: Epigrammata Sacra,
    pp. 79.




A second edition of this volume appeared in 1670. Its title-page is as
follows:

  RICHARDI CRASHAWI

  POEMATA

  et

  EPIGRAMMATA,

  Quae scripsit Latina & Graeca,
  Dum _Aulae Pemb._ Alumnus fuit,
  Et
  Collegii _Petrensis_ Socius.


  Editio Secunda, Auctior & emendatior.


  {Heineken eumathies pinytophronos, hen ho Melichros
  Eskesen, Mouson ammiga kai Chariton.}      {Anthol.}

  [Printer's ornament, as before.]

  Cantabrigiae,
  Ex Officina _Joan. Hayes_, Celeberrimae Academiae
  Typographi. 1670.

This is an 8vo. Collation: Title-page--and to Brook, as before; then
these additional Latin poems: In Picturam Reverendissimi Episcopi D.
Andrews--Votiva Domus Petrensis pro Domo Dei--In caeterorum Operum
difficili Parturitione Gemitus--Epitaphium in Gulielmum Herrisium--In
Eundem--Natalis Principis Mariae--In Serenissimae Reginae partum
hyemalem--Natalis Ducis Eboracensis--In faciem Augustiss. Regis a
morbillis integram--Ad Carolum Primum, Rex Redux--Ad Principem nondum
natum, Regina gravida. Bastard-title, 'Epigrammata Sacra, quae scripsit
Graeca et Latina'--Lectori (as before), nine leaves: Epigrammata Sacra,
pp. 67.

The additions to the second edition--besides the Latin poems
enumerated--were in the Epigrams these: No. 1, Pharisaeus et Publicanus,
Greek version--No. 11, Obolum Viduae, ib.--No. 53, Ecce locus ubi jacuit
Dominus, ib.--No. 120, In descensum Spiritus sancti, ib.--No. 124, In S.
Columbam ad Christi caput sedentem, ib.--No. 141, Ad D. Lucam medicum,
ib.--No. 148, In stabulum ubi natus est Dominus, ib.--No. 161, Hic lapis
fiat panis, ib.--No. 177, In die Ascensionis Dominicae, ib.--No. 178,
Caecus implorat Christum, Latin and Greek--No. 179, Quis ex vobis, &c.
ib.--No. 180, Herodi D. Jacobum obtruncati, ib.--No. 181, Caeci receptis,
&c. ib.--and No. 182, Zaccheus in sycomoro.

A third edition was issued in 1674. It is identical with that of 1670,
save in the date on title-page, printer's ornament, and this line at
bottom: 'Prostant venales apud _Joann. Creed_.' Probably consisted of
'remainders' of 1670 edition.

As the edition of 1634 was published during the author's residence in
the University, and so under his own eye, I have made it the basis of
our text, though with a vigilant eye on the later corrections; but have
given from the edition of 1670 the Greek versions of certain of the
Epigrams, and those added (as above). The Epistle-dedicatory to Lany,
and related introductory poems of 1634, alone, I prefix to the
Epigrammata Sacra, assigning the other poems more fittingly to the
Secular Poems (as annotated in the places). The Editor of the second
edition, 'auctior et emendatior,' has not been transmitted. For more on
the editions of the Epigrammata Sacra, see our Essay and Notes and
Illustrations. As explained in our Prefatory Note, the translations of
the Latin Poemata et Epigrammata, as of the others, follow the originals
successively. A. denotes the translator to be THOMAS ASHE, M.A.,
Ipswich; B., CLEMENT BARKSDALE (from 'Epigrammata Sacra selecta, cum
Anglica Versione. Sacred Epigrams Englished. London: Printed for John
Barksdale, Bookseller in Cirencester. 1682.' 12mo); CL., Rev. J.H.
CLARK, M.A., West Dereham, Norfolk; CR., CRASHAW himself; G., myself;
W., Rev. W. ARIS WILLMOTT (from his 'Lives of the Sacred Poets,' s.n.
Crashaw); and R. WI., Rev. RICHARD WILTON, M.A., Londesborough Rectory,
Market Weighton. In the present and succeeding division those Epigrams
translated by Crashaw himself are given under the related Latin--all
from the original text of 1646, as before. They consist of Nos. 1, 2, 8,
9, 11, 14, 15, 20, 21, 26, 29, 36, 40, 42, 43, 47, 49, 51, 54 (two), 56,
57, 63, 64, 68, 85, 91, 93, 101, 104, 106, 108, 115, 117, 140, 157, 160,
164, 169, 184, and 185 in the present, and of Nos. 21, 22, 28, 42, 46,
and 55 in next section.

It only remains that I add here, instead of noticing in their places,
the following more flagrant errors of Turnbull in the 'Epigrammata' and
related 'Poemata Latina et Graeca.' Similar lists will be found in the
introductory notes to the several divisions of this volume.

In the Epistle to Lany, line 18, avidi _for_ avide; line 29, amore _for_
amare; in the Ode, st. ii. line 1, ipsi _for_ ipse. In the address
'Lectori,' line 7, abi _for_ alis; line 29, putre _for_ putri; line 48,
mens _for_ meus; line 53, fingit _for_ finget; line 70, graves _for_
gravis; line 97, tota dropped out; line 120, negat _for_ neget; in
succeeding prose, line 29, Acygmanos _for_ acygnianos.

The misprints in the Epigrammata are so numerous, that it is deemed
expedient to tabulate them according to our numbering. On the errors in
the Greek, see our Preface to the present Volume.

Suus est et florum fructus; quibus fruimur, si non utilius, delicatius
certe. Neque etiam rarum est quod ad spem Veris, de se per flores suos
quasi pollicentis, adultioris anni, ipsiusque adeo Autumni exigamus
fidem. Ignoscas igitur, vir colendissime, properanti sub ora Apollinis
sui, primaeque adolescentiae lascivia exultanti Musae. Tenerae aetatis
flores adfert, non fructus serae: quos quidem exigere ad seram illam et
sobriam maturitatem, quam in fructibus expectamus merito, durum fuerit;
forsan et ipsa hac praecoci importunitate sua placituros magis: tibi
praesertim quem paternus animus, quod fieri solet, intentum tenet omni
suae spei diluculo, quo tibi de tuorum indole promittas aliquid. Ex more
etiam eorum, qui in praemium laboris sui pretiumque patientiae festini,
ex iis quae severunt ipsi et excoluerunt, quicquid est flosculi
prominulum, prima quasi verecundia auras et apertum Jovem experientis
arripiunt avide, saporemque illi non tam ex ipsius indole et ingenio
quam ex animi sui affectu, foventis in eo curas suas et spes, affingunt.
Patere igitur, reverende custos, hanc tibi ex istiusmodi floribus
corollam necti; convivalem vero: nec aliter passuram sidus illud oris
tui auspicatissimum, nisi, qua est etiam amoenitate, remissiore radio
cum se reclinat, et in tantum de se demit. Neque sane hoc scriptionis
genere, modo partes suas satis praestiterit, quid esse potuit otio
theologico accommodatius, quo nimirum res ipsa theologica poetica
amoenitate delinita majestatem suam venustate commendat. Hoc demum
quicquid est, amare tamen poteris, et voles, scio: non ut magnum quid,
non ut egregium, non ut te dignum denique, sed ut tuum: tuum summo jure,
utpote quod e tua gleba, per tuum radium, in manum denique tuam evocatum
fuerit. Quod restat hujus libelli fatis, exorandus es igitur, vir
spectatissime, ut quem sinu tum facili privatum excepisti, eum jam ore
magis publico alloquentem te non asperneris. Stes illi in limine, non
auspicium modo suum, sed et argumentum. Enimvero Epigramma sacrum tuus
ille vultus vel est, vel quid sit docet; ubi nimirum amabili diluitur
severum, et sanctum suavi demulcetur. Pronum me vides in negatam mihi
provinciam; laudum tuarum, intelligo: quas mihi cum modestia tua
abstulerit, reliquum mihi est necessario ut sim brevis; imo vero longus
nimium; utpote cui argumentum istud abscissum fuerit, in quo unice
poteram, et sine taedio, prolixus esse. Vale, virorum ornatissime, neque
dedigneris quod colere audeam Genii tui serenitatem supplex tam tenuis,
et, quoniam numen quoque hoc de se non negat, amare etiam. Interim vero
da veniam Musae in tantum sibi non temperanti; quin in hanc saltem
laudis tuae partem, quae tibi ex rebus sacris apud nos ornatis
meritissima est, istiusmodi carmine involare ausa sit, qualicunque:

    Salve, alme custos Pierii gregis,
    Per quem erudito exhalat in otio;
        Seu frigus udi captet antri,
            Sive Jovem nitidosque soles.

    Non ipse custos pulchrior invias
    Egit sub umbras Aemonios greges;
        Non ipse Apollo notus illis
            Lege suae meliore cannae.

    Tu, si sereno des oculo frui,
    Sunt rura nobis, sunt juga, sunt aquae,
        Sunt plectra dulcium sororum
            (Non alio mihi nota Phoebo).

    Te dante, castos composuit sinus;
    Te dante, mores sumpsit; et in suo
        Videnda vultu, pulveremque
            Relligio cineremque nescit.

    Stat cincta digna fronde decens caput:
    Suosque per te fassa palam Deos,
        Comisque, Diva, vestibusque
            Ingenium dedit ordinemque.

    Jamque ecce nobis amplior es modo
    Majorque cerni. Quale jubar tremit
        Sub os! verecundusque quanta
            Mole sui Genius laborat!

    Jam qui serenas it tibi per genas,
    Majore coelo sidus habet suum;
        Majorque circum cuspidatae
            Ora comis tua flos diei.

    Stat causa. Nempe hanc ipse Deus, Deus,
    Hanc ara, per te pulchra, diem tibi
        Tuam refundit, obvioque
            It radio tibi se colenti.

    Ecce, ecce! sacro in limine, dum pio
    Multumque prono poplite amas humum,
        Altaria annuunt ab alto;
            Et refluis tibi plaudit alis

    Pulchro incalescens officio, puer
    Quicunque crispo sidere crinium,
        Vultuque non fatente terram,
            Currit ibi roseus satelles.

    Et jure. Nam cum fana tot inviis
    Moerent ruinis, ipsaque, ceu preces
        Manusque non decora supplex
            Tendat, opem rogat, heu negatam!

    Tibi ipsa voti est ora sui rea.
    Et solvet. O quam semper apud Deum
        Litabis illum, cujus arae
            Ipse preces prius audiisti!


[TRANSLATION. Prose G.; verse CL.]

    _To the very reverend man_ BENJAMIN LANY, _Doctor of Divinity, most
    worthy Master of Pembroke College [Cambridge], the least of the
    least of those that are his, R[ichard] C[rashaw] implores the divine
    protection._[41]

Even flowers have their own peculiar fruit, which we enjoy, if not so
profitably, yet in a manner more refined. Nor is it unusual that, in
accordance with the hope of Spring, making promises for herself as it
were by her flowers, we demand credit for the maturer year, and even for
Autumn itself. Forgive, then, most Reverend Sir, the Muse hastening into
the presence of her Apollo, and exulting in the wantonness of earliest
youth. She offers the flowers of a tender age, not the fruits of a late
one, which flowers indeed it were unreasonable to demand in accordance
with that late and sober maturity which we rightly look for in
fruits--flowers which are more likely to be pleasing from the very fact
of their precocious importunity,--to thee above all, whom a fatherly
mind, as it is wont to happen, holds watching for every dawning of its
hope, by which you may give yourself assurance of anything respecting
the genius of your sons; after the manner also of those who, in haste
for the reward of their labour and the price of their patience, from
what they have themselves sown and tended, snatch greedily whatever part
may project a little of a floweret, which, as with early bashfulness, is
making trial of the airs and the open sky, and attach an odour to it,
not so much from its own nature and character as from the inclination of
their own mind, which fosters in it their own anxieties and hopes.
Suffer then, Reverend Master, this little garland, made of flowers of
such a sort, to be bound on thee; a festal one assuredly, and not able
to endure that most auspicious star of thy countenance in any other way
than--for it is even of such a graciousness--when it draws back with
milder ray, and so far subtracts from itself. Nor assuredly than this
kind of writing, provided it have sufficiently discharged its proper
functions, could anything be more suitable to theological leisure; for
in it without doubt the very substance of theology being overlaid with
poetic grace, sets off its grandeur by loveliness. Finally, whatever
this may be, you will nevertheless, I know, be able and willing to be
lovingly disposed towards it; not as anything great or uncommon; not, in
short, as anything worthy of you, but as your own--your own by highest
right as having been called forth from your soil, by your light, and, in
fine, into your hand. As for what fortune awaits this little book, deign
to be persuaded, most worshipful Sir, not to scorn when addressing you
now in a more public style him whom you have welcomed in private with so
ready an affection. May you stand on its threshold, not only as its good
omen but also as its subject! In very truth that countenance of yours is
a Sacred Epigram, or teaches what it should be, where forsooth severity
is tempered with love, and sanctity is mellowed by sweetness. You see me
inclined towards a sphere denied to me--that of sounding your praises, I
mean; which since your modesty has taken from me, it remains of
necessity that I should be brief: yes indeed, I am too diffuse, seeing
that the very subject is cut off from me in which alone I was, and even
without irksomeness, able to be prolix. Farewell, most cultured of men,
and do not disdain me, so insignificant a suppliant, for daring to
honour your tranquil genius, and, since divinity even does not forbid
this respecting itself, also to love it. But in the mean while give
pardon to the Muse, to such a degree unrestrained as to have dared for
this part at least of your praise, which is most due to you on account
of sacred things that have been honoured amongst us, to fly towards you
with a strain of such kind as this, whatever it may be:

    Kind Guardian of the Muses' flock,
      Through whom it breathes in learn'd repose,
    Whether it choose the dripping rock,
      Or where the open sunshine glows.

    Not fairer he through trackless shade
      Who led Aemonia's flocks of old;
    Not even Apollo, when he play'd,
      With defter touch could charm the fold.

    If thou the eye serene dost grant,
      Green fields are ours, and streams and hills,
    And, since no Phoebus else we want,
      The Muses with their dulcet quills.

    Religion too with modest grace
      Through thee assumes a gentler mien;
    Through thee again can show her face,
      No more in dust and ashes seen.

    Her brows crown'd meetly, and, through thee,
      Her God in sight of all confess'd,
    She gives in her divinity
      Meaning and law to garb and vest.

    Lo, while we gaze, an ample state
      Adorns thee; what a lustrous sheen
    Plays on thy lips! with what a weight
      Thy reverent Genius toils within!

    For him on whom thy calm glance flows
      His star sheds down a fuller ray;
    The light that o'er thine aspect glows
      Is brighter than the shafts of Day.

    And there is cause. The Lord of heaven,
      Whose altar thou hast made so fair,
    Pours back the light that thou hast given,
      With glory meets His worshipper.

    Lo, on the threshold of thy God
      While thou dost stoop on bended knee,
    The altar from on high doth nod,
      Its plausive wings are bent to thee.

    And, glowing with his duty's worth,
      Each starry-tressed chorister
    With look that savours not of earth
      Tends like a rosy cherub there.

    And rightly. For, when ruin-wreck'd,
      With prayers and outstretch'd hands the fane
    Bemoan'd itself in all neglect,
      And sought elsewhere for help in vain,--

    To thee by its own vows 'tis bound,
      And now repays thee. At the shrine
    Whose cry so well thy ears hath found
      Long, long may prayer and praise be thine!




LECTORI.


    Salve. Jamque vale. Quid enim quis pergeret ultra?
      Qua jocus et lusus non vocat, ire voles?
    Scilicet hic, Lector, cur noster habebere, non est;
      Deliciis folio non faciente tuis.
    Nam nec Acidalios halat mihi pagina rores;
      Nostra Cupidineae nec favet aura faci.
    Frustra hinc ille suis quicquam promiserit alis:
      Frustra hinc illa novo speret abire sinu.
    Ille e materna melius sibi talia myrto;
      Illa jugis melius poscat ab Idaliis.
    Quaerat ibi suus in quo cespite surgat Adonis,
      Quae melior teneris patria sit violis.
    Illinc totius Florae, verisque, suique
      Consilio, ille alas impleat, illa sinus.
    Me mea, casta tamen, si sit rudis, herba coronet:
      Me mea, si rudis est, sit rudis, herba juvat.
    Nulla meo Circaea tument tibi pocula versu:
      Dulcia, et in furias officiosa tuas.
    Nulla latet Lethe, quam fraus tibi florea libat,
      Quam rosa sub falsis dat malefida genis.
    Nulla verecundum mentitur mella venenum:
      Captat ab insidiis linea nulla suis.
    Et spleni, et jecori foliis bene parcitur istis.
      Ah, male cum rebus staret utrumque meis!
    Rara est quae ridet, nulla est quae pagina prurit,
      Nulla salax, si quid norit habere salis.
    Non nudae Veneres, nec, si jocus, udus habetur:
      Non nimium Bacchus noster Apollo fuit.
    Nil cui quis putri sit detorquendus ocello;
      Est nihil obliquo quod velit ore legi.
    Haec coram atque oculis legeret Lucretia justis;
      Iret et illaesis hinc pudor ipse genis.
    Nam neque candidior voti venit aura pudici
      De matutina virgine thura ferens:
    Cum vestis nive vincta sinus, nive tempora fulgens,
      Dans nive flammeolis frigida jura comis,
    Religiosa pedum sensim vestigia librans,
      Ante aras tandem constitit, et tremuit.
    Nec gravis ipsa suo sub numine castior halat
      Quae pia non puras summovet ara manus.
    Tam Venus in nostro non est nimis aurea versu:
      Tam non sunt pueri tela timenda dei.
    Saepe puer dubias circum me moverat alas,
      Jecit et incertas nostra sub ora faces;
    Saepe vel ipse sua calamum mihi blandus ab ala,
      Vel matris cygno de meliore dedit;
    Saepe Dionaeae pactus mihi serta coronae;
      Saepe: Meus vates tu, mihi dixit, eris.
    I procul, i cum matre tua, puer improbe, dixi:
      Non tibi cum numeris res erit ulla meis.
    Tu Veronensi cum passere pulchrior ibis:
      Bilbilicisve queas comptius esse modis.
    Ille tuos finget quocunque sub agmine crines:
      Undique nequitiis par erit ille tuis.
    Ille nimis, dixi, patet in tua proelia campus:
      Heu, nimis est vates et nimis ille tuus!
    Gleba illa, ah, tua quam tamen urit adultera messis!
      Esset Idumaeo germine quanta parens!
    Quantus ibi et quantae premeret puer ubera matris!
      Nec coelos vultu dissimulante suos.
    Ejus in isto oculi satis essent sidera versu;
      Sidereo matris quam bene tuta sinu!
    Matris ut hic similes in collum mitteret ulnas,
      Inque sinus niveos pergeret, ore pari;
    Utque genis pueri haec aequis daret oscula labris,
      Et bene cognatis iret in ora rosis;
    Quae Mariae tam larga meat, quam disceret illic
      Uvida sub pretio gemma tumere suo!
    Staret ibi ante suum lacrymatrix Diva Magistrum:
      Seu levis aura volet, seu gravis unda cadat;
    Luminis haec soboles, et proles pyxidis illa,
      Pulchrius unda cadat, suavius aura volet.
    Quicquid in his sordet demum, luceret in illis.
      Improbe, nec satis est hunc tamen esse tuum?
    Improbe, cede, puer: quid enim mea carmina mulces?
      Carmina de jaculis muta futura tuis.
    Cede, puer, qua te petulantis fraena puellae;
      Turpia quae revocant pensa procacis herae;
    Qua miseri male pulchra nitent mendacia limi;
      Qua cerussatae, furta decora, genae;
    Qua mirere rosas, alieni sidera veris;
      Quas nivis haud propriae bruma redempta domat.
    Cede, puer, dixi et dico; cede, improba mater:
      Altera Cypris habet nos; habet alter Amor.
    Scilicet hic Amor est; hic est quoque mater Amoris.
      Sed Mater virgo; sed neque caecus Amor.
    O Puer! o Domine! o magnae reverentia Matris,
      Alme tui stupor et relligio gremii!
    O Amor, innocuae cui sunt pia jura pharetrae,
      Nec nisi de casto corde sagitta calens!
    Me, Puer, o certa, quem figis, fige sagitta;
      O tua de me sit facta pharetra levis!
    Quodque illinc sitit et bibit, et bibit et sitit usque;
      Usque meum sitiat pectus, et usque bibat.
    Fige, Puer, corda haec. Seu spinis exiguus quis,
      Seu clavi aut hastae cuspide magnus ades;
    Seu major cruce cum tota; seu maximus ipso
      Te corda haec figis denique; fige, Puer.
    O metam hanc tuus aeternum inclamaverit arcus:
      Stridat in hanc teli densior aura tui.
    O tibi si jaculum ferat ala ferocior ullum,
      Hanc habeat triti vulneris ire viam.
    Quique tuae populus cunque est, quae turba, pharetrae;
      Hic bene vulnificas nidus habebit aves.
    O mihi sis bello semper tam saevus in isto!
      Pectus in hoc nunquam mitior hostis eas.
    Quippe ego quam jaceam pugna bene sparsus in illa!
      Quam bene sic lacero pectore sanus ero!
    Haec mea vota. Mei sunt haec quoque vota libelli.
      Haec tua sint, Lector, si meus esse voles.
    Si meus esse voles, meus ut sis, lumina, Lector,
      Casta, sed o nimium non tibi sicca, precor.
    Nam tibi fac madidis meus ille occurrerit alis,
      Sanguine, seu lacryma diffluat ille sua:
    Stipite totus hians, clavisque reclusus, et hasta:
      Fons tuus in fluvios desidiosus erit?
    Si tibi sanguineo meus hic tener iverit amne,
      Tune tuas illi, dure, negabis aquas?
    Ah durus! quicunque meos, nisi siccus, amores
      Nolit, et hic lacrymae rem neget esse suae.
    Saepe hic Magdalinas vel aquas vel amaverit undas;
      Credo nec Assyrias mens tua malit opes.
    Scilicet ille tuos ignis recalescet ad ignes;
      Forsan et illa tuis unda natabit aquis.
    Hic eris ad cunas, et odoros funere manes:
      Hinc ignes nasci testis, et inde meos.
    Hic mecum, et cum matre sua, mea gaudia quaeres:
      Maturus Procerum seu stupor esse velit;
    Sive per antra sui lateat, tunc templa, sepulchri:
      Tertia lux reducem, lenta sed illa, dabit.
    Sint fidae precor, ah, dices, facilesque tenebrae;
      Lux mea dum noctis, res nova! poscit opem.
    Denique charta meo quicquid mea dicat amori,
      Illi quo metuat cunque, fleatve, modo,
    Laeta parum, dices, haec, sed neque dulcia non sunt:
      Certe et amor, dices, hujus amandus erat.

Si nimium hic promitti tibi videtur, Lector bone, pro eo cui
satisfaciendo libellus iste futurus fuerit; scias me in istis non ad
haec modo spectare quae hic habes, sed ea etiam quae olim, haec interim
fovendo, habere poteris. Nolui enim, si hactenus deesse amicis meis non
potui, flagitantibus a me, etiam cum dispendii sui periculo, paterer eos
experiri te in tantum favorem tuum, nolui, inquam, fastidio tuo
indulgere. Satis hic habes quod vel releges ad ferulam suam, neque enim
maturiores sibi annos ex his aliqua vendicant, vel ut pignus plurium
adultiorumque in sinu tuo reponas. Elige tibi ex his utrumvis. Me
interim quod attinet, finis meus non fefellit. Maximum meae ambitionis
scopum jamdudum attigi: tunc nimirum cum quale-cunque hoc meum pene
infantis Musae murmur ad aures istas non ingratum sonuit, quibus neque
doctiores mihi de publico timere habeo, nec sperare clementiores; adeo
ut de tuo jam plausu, dicam ingenue et breviter, neque securus sim ultra
neque solicitus. Prius tui, quisquis es, Lector, apud me reverentia
prohibet; de cujus judicio omnia possum magna sperare: posterius illorum
reverentia non sinit, de quorum perspicacitate maxima omnia non possum
mihi non persuadere. Quanquam o quam velim tanti me esse in quo patria
mea morem istum suum deponere velit, genio suo tam non dignum; istum
scilicet quo, suis omnibus fastiditis, ea exosculatur unice, quibus
trajecisse Alpes et de transmarino esse, in pretium cessit! Sed relictis
hisce, nimis improbae spei votis, convertam me ad magistros acygnianos;
quos scio de novissimis meis verbis, quanquam neminem nominarim, iratos
me reliquisse: bilem vero componant; et mihi se hoc debere, ambitioso
juveni verbum tam magnum ignoscant--debere, inquam, fateantur: quod
nimirum in tam nobili argumento, in quo neque ad foetida de suis sanctis
figmenta, neque ad putidas de nostris calumnias opus habeant confugere,
de tenui hoc meo dederim illorum magnitudini unde emineat. Emineat vero;
serius dico, sciantque me semper se habituros esse sub ea, quam mihi
eorum lux major affuderit, umbra, placidissime acquiescentem.


[TRANSLATION. Verse and Prose, G.]

TO THE READER.

    'Greeting,' Reader; and now 'farewell'!
    Wherefore shouldst thou on my page dwell,
    Where neither jest nor sport inviteth,
    That the jocund youth delighteth?
    Therefore, Reader, pass thee by
    To thine own idle jollity:
    The notes that trill from my poor lute
    Such as thee shall never suit;
    Nor here are Acidalian dews
    That Venus' roses sweet suffuse;
    Nor breath sets Cupid's torch a-blaze
    That lovers on my lines may gaze.
    Vainly shall mother and shall son
    Look here for lewd emotion.
    Cupid, seek thy mother's kirtle,
    Or hide thee 'neath her fragrant myrtle.
    And, Venus, thy Idalian hills
    Will better yield thee sport that thrills:
    Thither, therefore, goddess, turn;
    O'er thy lost Adonis burn;
    Or devise, if grief thee frets,
    Other shrines for thy violets:
    There, with Flora and the Spring
    The green earth enamelling,
    Thou mayst fill thy bosom's whiteness,
    He his wings in all their brightness,
    With all flow'rs that wait on thee
    When thou holdest revelry.
    Me my own poor flow'r will crown;
    Poor 'tis true, yet all my own--
    Poor but pure. So let it be,
    Those unto others, this to me.
    No Circe-cup foams in my verse,
    To make fierce lustings still more fierce;
    No draft of Lethe here doth flow,
    Flow'ry above, deathly below;
    No false cheeks, with falser bloom--
    A rose up-bursting from a tomb;
    No barb hid 'neath treach'rous plume;
    No poison spread as honey'd bait;
    No line where danger lies in wait:
    Here's nor spleen nor melancholy,
    That for me were unmeet wholly;
    Rarely do I raise a smile,
    Ne'er merge my wit in wanton wile;
    Never quicken Passion's pulse,
    Nor show nude Beauty to convulse,
    Until beneath the hoof o' th' flesh
    The strong man bound is in Lust's mesh.
    If jest I pass, do not repine
    To learn it reeks not of the wine;
    For my Apollo is celestial,
    And from Bacchus shrinks as bestial.
    Nothing that's foul my page contains;
    Nothing the modest eye arraigns;
    Nothing to cause averted face--
    Lucretia every line might trace
    With calm, serene, unfearing eye,
    Nor blush stain cheek of Modesty.
    For not more pure the maiden's vow[42]
    Whisper'd in tremulous words and low,
    As, girt in snowy robe, her breast
    Heaves like a wave in sweet unrest,
    And the white veil shows whiter brow
    In pureness of unfallen snow,
    With flame-gleam from meek-dropped hair
    Dishevell'd by the am'rous air:
    Soft strains with her soft voice blending,
    The marriage-rites to heaven ascending:
    Yea, not the altar's self exhaleth
    More chastely, as its God it haileth,
    That keeps far off unholy hands
    While there the priest with bow'd head stands.
    My verse is not the Queen of Love's,
    Nor knows the cooing of her doves:
    Her beauty me not overpowers,
    Though bright as skies when no cloud low'rs;
    Vainly at me her tricksy boy
    His arrows shoots. The sweet annoy
    I never felt; though oft and oft
    He hover'd o'er me, and with soft,
    Sly, 'luring glances his torch wav'd,
    And look'd to find me swift enslav'd;
    Offer'd a quill from his own wing,
    E'en from his mother's swan--to sing;
    Ay, often Venus' love-wreaths weaving,
    On my brow the symbol leaving:
    He would laugh, and Poet style me,
    And with flatteries beguile me:
    'Begone, begone, O wanton boy!
    Thy mother too, though Queen of Joy.'
    Thus did I speak. Naught of my song
    Shall thy tyranny prolong:
    Get thee, with thy torch and arrow,
    Unto the Veronian sparrow;                    _Catullus_
    Or the Bilbilician win                         _Martial_
    To embalm thy pleasant sin:
    Be thy assaults however vile,
    He on thee will smile, and smile:
    He, thy love-locks curious twining,
    Shall ne'er come short of thy inclining:
    He thine own poet is, and will
    Give thee full license to instill
    By jest and quip and jollity
    Whate'er it listeth thee to try.
    Alas, that genius so august
    Should pander to adult'rous lust!
    Alas, that he, poet so true,
    Should poet be, Cupid, to you!
    O, what harvest of rich thought
    Judean seed from him had brought,
    If, up-climbing holy mountains,
    He had drunk from hallow'd fountains!
    Mother and son, I see them now,
    As round her neck his arms he'd throw,
    Nestling with his azure eyes,
    Her bosom's splendour for his skies;
    Kissing, and kiss'd in sweet reply,
    As soft winds o'er violets die:
    While she all her love discloses,
    Murm'ring on his lips' twin roses:
    His lips like hers, and hers like his,
    Glued i' the rapture of their bliss.
    Visions like these would Martial give
    With dainty touch and fugitive.
    The heav'nly Weeper there would bow
    Before her Lord, and pay her vow:
    Now is uttered gentle sigh,
    And now great tears gleam in her eye:
    That, offspring of the stainless Light;
    This, of the Pyx's mystic rite:
    In his verse, tears, sighs should fall
    Delicate and musical:
    In fine, whate'er in mine were mean
    Should radiant grow as sunlight's sheen.
    Go, then, go, insatiate boy,
    Nor me longer seek t' annoy:
    I've said it, nor shall e'er unsay:
    Go to thy mother, and there play.
    Why wilt thou whisper flattery,
    And praise my Muse's witchery--
    Verses that reck not of thy smarts--
    And smite me with thy fire-tipp'd darts?
    Go, get thee gone! Thy haunt must be
    Where there's wanton revelry,
    And the young minx with toss o' curls
    Opes her lips to show her pearls;
    Opes her lips, with some gross jest
    A foolish lover to arrest.
    Thither go, where falsely-fair
    Beauty is bought and sold; and where,
    Flaunting with painted cheek, and eye
    A-flame to ev'ry devilry,
    Base women seek base men, and tingle
    Their hot veins as they commingle,
    Baring their charms, 'neath alien roses
    Ministering such sweets as Hell composes.
    Hence, therefore, Cupid! Venus, hence!
    I yield not to your violence:
    I've said it, nor shall you allure
    My heart to own your sway impure.
    Another Cypris holds me now,
    Another Love receives my vow:
    For Love is here and Mother kind,
    But she a Virgin; He not blind.
    O Child! O Lord! great Mother blest!
    O wonder of thy holy breast!
    O Love, whose quiver's sacred pow'rs
    Ne'er send forth arrow that devours,
    Unless a shaft pierce the pure heart,
    That Thou mayst heal the blessed smart.
    Me whom Thou piercest, holy Child,
    Pierce, pierce me sure with arrows mild.
    Let Thy quiver grow more light
    As Thou dost me yearning smite:
    What my soul pants for, and still drinks
    And drinks, and thirsts, and never thinks
    To get enough, O give, still give.
    Thus would I die; thus would I live.
    Transfix this heart, Child: howsoe'er
    Thou comest,--crown'd with thorns and bare,
    Or great with the awful heraldry
    Of nail and spear for Faith to see;
    Or greater still, on the holy rood
    Wet with the terror of Thy Blood;
    Or great'st of all, Thyself alone
    In meek might of Thy Passion,--
    Still pierce this heart; O pierce it, Child:
    _Thus_ would I drink in rapture wild.
    O that Thy bow might wound me still!
    O that of wounds I had my fill!
    Or, if some swifter wing there be,
    That it would fly to me--to me!
    Behold, my Saviour, this poor breast,
    And take it as Thine arrows' nest:
    I seek not to be spar'd one blow:
    Thus would I have Thee still my foe;
    Still yearn that wounded I may be;
    For wounds like these are ecstasy.
    These are my wishes: and my Books,
    May they be his who on them looks!
    Seek'st, Reader, to be mine? Then, last,
    I ask thy eyes that they be chaste;
    Chaste, but not tearless; my dear Love
    To meet and know, as from above
    He comes, and still the Crucified,
    Proclaiming how for man He died
    By thorn, and nail, and spear, and cry,
    And bitterest words of agony:
    Say, should He meet thee thus in blood,
    Couldst thou e'en grudge of tears a flood?
    Ah, hard thy heart as e'er was stone,
    That all unmov'd can hear Him groan,
    Nor by a throb of feeling show
    Thou hast a sense of His great woe;
    While here He treasured human tears
    Hushing sad Mary in her fears,
    As to His feet in shame she crept,
    And with white drops them all bewept:
    More than Assyrian gold to thee
    Such tears, if thou their worth couldst see.
    His love with thine again will glow,
    His tears afresh with thine will flow.
    Here, Reader, glancing through my Book,
    Thou shalt upon His cradle look:
    To His sweet obsequies now turn,
    And mark how still my love shall burn.
    Here, with His Mother and with me,
    My ceaseless sacred joys shalt see:
    Whether Earth's Princes speechless stand
    As sudden darkness wraps the land;
    Or He lies hidden in the Cave,
    A temple now, and not a grave;
    But the third morning shall restore Him:
    Ah, much too slow those days pass o'er Him!
    Be true, ye shadows of the tomb;
    Enfold Him in a kindly gloom:
    Thus wilt thou pray; while my dear Light
    (O strange!) demands the help of Night.
    In fine, whate'er my Book shall say
    To my dear Love--however pray,
    However fear, however weep,
    And with sweet tears its pages steep--
    My words thy willing words will move.
    'O, not enough these things I love;
    But they are sweet all things above;
    And certainly the love of Him
    Deserves all other loves to dim.'

If it seem to you, good Reader, that I have promised overmuch on behalf
of him to whom this tractate shall be pleasing, know that I do not look
merely on those things which you possess here, but also on those which,
by cherishing such as you now have, you may hereafter obtain; for I have
been unwilling, if hitherto I have not been a-wanting to my friends
earnestly entreating me that I should allow them, even at the risk of
their own peril, to encroach on your good-will, however great--I have
been unwilling, I say, to give myself up to your fastidious criticism.
You have enough here either to hand over to the rod which it deserves
(for none of these things ask or claim for themselves maturer years), or
to lay it up in your bosom as a pledge of more and of advanced
attempts. Choose for yourself an alternative. As for myself, my aim has
not deceived me. I have already attained the utmost pinnacle of my
ambition, at the time when this somewhat indifferent murmur of my
almost-infantine Muse sounded not unmusically in those ears, than which
from the world at large I have none more learned to fear, none more
indulgent to hope for; so that, as regards your applause, I will speak
candidly and at once: I am neither over-confident nor over-solicitous of
it. Firstly, my respect for you, Reader, whoever you are, and of whose
decision I can hope everything, restrains; and next, my respect for
those of whose penetration I am unable not to persuade myself to hope
the greatest things. Yet still, how I do wish that I were of service
whenever my Country desires to cast aside its own particular custom, so
unworthy its own worth--that custom particularly by which, all her own
things being despised, she only prizes those things to which having
crossed the Alps and lived over the sea has given a value! But these
wishes of too rash hope being put aside, let me turn to the acygnian
gentlemen, whom I know--although I shall name none personally--to have
angrily abandoned me on account of some of my recent sayings. Still, let
them compose their temper, and let them confess--may they pardon such a
great saying from a forward young man!--I say, let them confess that
they owe me this: that, in truth, in so grand an argument, in which
they have not recourse to the stale untruths concerning their own
services, nor to the nauseous calumnies concerning ours. With regard to
this slight statement of mine, I have yielded to the importance of those
from whence it springs. And let it spring, forsooth! I speak
seriously--and let them know that they will always find me most
tranquilly reposing under that shadow which their greater light has cast
around me!

_Pharisaeus et Publicanus._ Luc. xviii. 14-19.

    En duo templum adeunt, diversis mentibus ambo.

    It gravis hic, et in alta ferox penetralia tendit.
      Plus habet hic templi; plus habet ille Dei.

_Two went up into the Temple to pray._

    Two went to pray! O, rather say,
    One went to brag, th' other to pray.
    One stands up close, and treads on high,
    Where th' other dares not send his eye.
    One neerer to God's altar trod;
    The other to the altar's God.                        CR.

ANOTHER VERSION.

    Two men unto the Temple went to pray.
    That, with a downcast look, stood far away;
    This, near the altar, himself highly bore:
    This of the Temple, that of God hath more.            B.

_In asinum Christi vectorem._ Matt. xxi. 7.

    Ille[43] suum didicit quondam objurgare magistrum:
      Et quid ni discas tu celebrare tuum?
    Mirum non minus est, te jam potuisse tacere,
      Illum quam fuerat tum potuisse loqui.

_Upon the asse that bore our Saviour._

    Hath only Anger an omnipotence
                        In eloquence?
    Within the lips of Love and Joy doth dwell
                        No miracle?
    Why else had Balaam's asse a tongue to chide
                        His master's pride,
    And thou, heaven-burthen'd beast, hast ne're a word
                        To praise thy Lord?
    That he should find a tongue and vocal thunder
                        Was a great wonder;
    But O, methinkes, 'tis a farre greater one
                        That thou find'st none.          CR.

MORE CLOSELY.

    The ass of old had power to chide its wilful lord;
    And hast not thou the power to speak one praiseful word?
    Not less a marvel, sure, this silence is in thee
    Than that the ass of old to speak had liberty.        G.

_Dominus apud suos vilis._ Luc. iv. 28-29.

    En consanguinei! patriis en exul in oris

      O consanguineus quam fuit ille magis!

_The Lord 'despised and rejected' by His own people._

    See, O my kinsmen, what strange thing is this!
    Christ in's own country a great stranger is.
    The thief which bled upon the Cross with Thee
    Was more ally'd in consanguinity.[44]                 B.

_Ad Bethesdae piscinam positus._ Joan. v. 1-16.

    Unde hoc naufragium felix medicaeque procellae,

_The cripple at the Pool of Bethesda._

    What Tantalus is this, who health still craves
    So oft, yet vainly, from the refluent waves?
    And whence this happy wreck, this healing strife,
    This storm that drifts its victim into life?         CL.


ANOTHER VERSION.

    What new Tantalus is here,
      Couch'd by this swift-ebbing wave,
    Whom the healing flood comes near,
      Then retiring fails to save?

    O, what happy shipwreck this,

    Through open'd depths of His own heaven He soars,
    And from His face in heaven a new heaven pours.
    Scatter'd before Him down the welkin sinks
    The sun, and its own sun's near glory drinks.
    Moon unto sun for light no more beholden,
    Now from more lustrous sun returns all golden.
    These triumphs o'er Thyself Thou grantest, Lord;
    Triumphs no other could suffice to 'accord.      R. WI.

    Verum ubi composito sedit fax blandior astro,

_The descent of the Holy Spirit._

    Booms the thunder through the sky,
      Flash the lightnings, threats the storm;
    Cries the Jew with vengeful eye:
      See SIN doom'd in fitting form!
    But, lo, the lightning, paled to light
      Mild and calm as ev'ning's star,
    Binds their brows with nimbus bright,
      Playing softly i' their hair.
    To the Jews it is not lightning,
    Yet the more the name's enlightening.[70]             G.

    Unde et luxuriare potest, habet hinc mea vita:
      Ample et magnifice mors habet unde mori.

_God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son...._

    Ah, 'tis too much to give Him for our sake:

    Amply, magnificently, Death may die.              R. WI.

_I have bought five yoke of oxen._

    Thou sayest 'No,' pretending

    Farewell, O thou unworthy

    Salve, mortales nimium dignate penates:
      Digna Deo soboles, digna tonante Deo.
    O salve, quid enim, alme, tuos latuisse volebas?
      Te dicit certe vel tua lingua Deum.
    Laudem hanc haud miror: meruit facundus haberi,
      Qui claudo promptos suasit habere pedes.

_St. Paul, healing the lame man with a word, is worshipped by the
Lystrians as Mercury._

    What Tagus, what Pactolus here is rolled?
    'Tis not man's voice: a God, a God behold.
    Hail, too much honour thou to men hast done,
    Of Jove, of thundering Jove the worthy son.
    Hail, Lord, for why wouldst hide thee from thine own?
    A God e'en by thy tongue assuredly art known.

    O Jesus, hovering o'er Thy hallow'd head,
      Within Thy hair's sweet shade it seeks a nest.
    There does it breathe a mystic song to Thee,
      A melody unlike all earthly sound:
    That Bird alone to this pure nest may flee;
      This nest alone worthy the Bird is found.           W.

_The doors of the prison self-opening to Peter._

    Good jailor, how is this,
      These doors thou lockest here?
    That Peter has the keys
      'Tis now to all men clear.
    Thou say'st the doors self-open,

_The Pharisees murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth
with them._

    Ah, let him perish in his harsh protests

    They spread the table, but He is the feast.      G. & B.

_On the beam of the Pharisee._

_They determined that if any man should confess Him to be Christ, he

_Concerning the prayer of the sons of Zebedee._

      Vitae hoc aeternum mane tuumque diem.

_On the day of our Lord's resurrection, the Magdalene bearing spices
cometh to the sepulchre._ Marc. xvi. 1; Luc. xxiv. 1.

    Come thou too, thou; kneel by thy Phoenix' tomb;
    Bring thy poor offerings too, my soul, and come.
    With thee no herbs and fragrant spice are seen--
    Such odorous tribute gave the Magdalene;
    But these--no herbs nor spices equal them--
    These little liquid drops, each tear a gem.
    One tear is much: thine did not fall in vain,
    Sweet Magdalene; thou knewest the tears were gain.
    With these--her Lord's head in amomum laid--
    The humble feet the head's despair she made.
    Now, while her breast moist with such fragrance lies,
    She in a strife draws sweeter from her eyes.
    Lord Christ, these tears are well: well fits it too
    Life's everlasting morn drip with such dew.           A.

    Arma vides; arcus, pharetramque levesque sagittas,
      Et quocunque fuit nomine miles Amor.
    His fuit usus Amor: sed et haec fuit ipse; suumque
      Et jaculum, et jaculis ipse pharetra suis.

      Quum scelus agnoscet dextera quaeque suum?
    Improbe, quae dederis, cernes ibi vulnera, miles,
      Qua tibi cunque tuus luserit arte furor.
    Seu digito suadente tuo mala laurus inibat
      Temporibus; sacrum seu bibit hasta latus:

    These arms Love used--nay, Himself was: His own
    Dart and darts' quiver was Himself alone.
    Now they but shine, and, dusty battle ended,
    In treasur'd glory are on high suspended.
    Time comes when unto Wrath these arms, both quiver
    And quiver's offspring, darts, Love will deliver.
    Ah, with what thoughts, what countenance wilt thou stand
    When its own guilt comes home to each right hand?
    Wretch, thou wilt see the wounds which thou hast made,
    And with what fatal skill thy fury play'd:
    Whether with bloody wreath thy fingers plied
    His temples, or thy spear drank His dear side;
    Or 'neath thy blow nails turned a cruel red,
    Or the scourge blush'd as at thy call it sped.
    Wretch, there the wounds thou gavest thou shalt see:
    To see the wound thou gav'st a wound shall be.
    Stroke self-avenging follows nails and spear:
    Its nail and spear of recompense are here.
    Such awful righteous wrath who would excite?
    Thy very wounds, O Christ, for Thee will fight.   R. WI.

    Nam quid ad haec Pueri vel labra genasve parentis?
      Heu, quid ad haec facient oscula, nox et hyems!
    Lilia ad haec facerent, faceret rosa; quicquid et halat

    Hi meruere, quibus vel nox sit nulla; vel ulla
      Si sit, eat nostra purius illa die.
    Ecce sed hos quoque nox et hyems clausere tenellos:
      Et quis scit, quid nox, quid meditetur hyems?
    Ah, ne quid meditetur hyems saevire per Austros,
      Quaeque solet nigros nox mala ferre metus!
    Ah, ne noctis eat currus non mollibus Euris,
      Aspera ne tetricos nuntiet aura Notos!
    Heu, quot habent tenebrae, quot vera pericula secum,
      Quot noctem dominam quantaque monstra colunt!
    Quot vaga quae falsis veniunt ludibria formis!
      Trux oculus, Stygio concolor ala Deo!
    Seu veris ea, sive vagis stant monstra figuris;
      Virginei satis est hinc, satis inde metus.
    Ergo veni; totoque veni resonantior arcu,
      Cynthia, praegnantem clange procul pharetram.
    Monstra vel ista vel illa, tuis sint meta sagittis:
      Nec fratris jaculum certior aura vehat.
    Ergo veni, totoque veni, flagrantior ore,
      Dignaque Apollineas sustinuisse vices.
    Scis bene quid deceat Phoebi lucere sororem:
      Ex his, si nescis, Cynthia, disce genis.
    O tua, in his, quanto lampas formosior iret!
      Nox suam, ab his, quanto malit habere diem!
    Quantum ageret tacitos haec luna modestior ignes,
      Atque verecundis sobria staret equis!
    Luna, tuae non est rosa tam pudibunda diei,
      Nec tam Virgineo fax tua flore tremit.
    Ergo veni; sed et astra, tuas age, Cynthia, turmas:
      Illa oculos pueri, quos imitentur, habent.
    Hinc oculo, hinc astro: at parili face nictat utrumque;
      Aetheris os, atque os aethereum Pueri.
    Aspice, quam bene res utriusque deceret utrumque!
      Quam bene in alternas mutua regna manus!
    Ille oculus coeli hoc si staret in aethere frontis;
      Sive astrum hoc Pueri fronte sub aetherea.
    Si Pueri hoc astrum aetherea sub fronte micaret,
      Credat et hunc oculum non minus esse suum.
    Ille oculus coeli, hoc si staret in aethere frontis,
      Non minus in coelis se putet esse suis.
    Tam pulchras variare vices cum fronte Puelli,
      Cumque Puelli oculis aether et astra queant.
    Astra quidem vellent; vellent aeterna pacisci
      Foedera mutatae sedis inire vicem.
    Aether et ipse, licet numero tam dispare, vellet
      Mutatis oculis tam bona pacta dari.
    Quippe iret coelum quanto melioribus astris,
      Astra sua hos oculos si modo habere queat!
    Quippe astra in coelo quantum meliore micarent,
      Si frontem hanc possint coelum habuisse suum.
    Aether et astra velint: frustra velit aether et astra:
      Ecce negat Pueri frons, oculique negant.
    Ah, neget illa, negent illi: nam quem aethera mallent
      Isti oculi? aut frons haec quae magis astra velit?
    Quid si aliquod blanda face lene renideat astrum?
      Lactea si coeli terque quaterque via est?
    Blandior hic oculus, roseo hoc qui ridet in ore;
      Lactea frons haec est terque quaterque magis.

      Sidera de coelis non bene danda suis.
    Ergo negant: seque ecce sua sub nube recondunt,
      Sub tenera occidui nube supercilii:
    Nec claudi contenta sui munimine coeli,
      Quaerunt in gremio matris ubi lateant.
    Non nisi sic tactis ubi nix tepet illa pruinis,
      Castaque non gelido frigore vernat hyems.
    Scilicet iste dies tam pulchro vespere tingi
      Dignus; et hos soles sic decet occidere.

      Pone per Hesperias strata pudenda rosas.
    Illas nempe rosas, quas conscia purpura pinxit;
      Culpa pudorque suus queis dedit esse rosas.
    Hos soles, niveae noctes, castumque cubile,
      Quod purum sternet per mare virgo Thetis;
    Hos, sancti flores; hos, tam sincera decebant
      Lilia; quaeque sibi non rubuere rosae.
    Hos, decuit sinus hic; ubi toto sidere proni
      Ecce lavant sese lacteo in oceano.
    Atque lavent: tandemque suo se mane resolvant,
      Ipsa dies ex hoc ut bibat ore diem.

_On the night and winter journey of the Infant Lord._

    These tender travellers, feel they Night's dark sway,
    Mother and Child, too good for whitest day?
    For how will mother's cheeks, or lips of Child,
    How kisses fare, from Night and Winter wild?
    With lilies these, with roses, should be blest,
    Or sweetest breath of violet-perfum'd West.
    Such travellers merited to have no night,
    Or, if at all, one whiter than our light.
    Winter and Night these tender ones enclose,
    And what Night plots, or Winter, ah, who knows?
    Ah, lest fell Winter with its north-winds rage,
    Ill-omen'd Night its wonted fears engage.
    Ah, lest rough east-winds should Night's chariot draw,
    Or harsh south-winds should shake the heart with awe.
    What real perils troop in Darkness' train,
    Over what monsters Night extends her reign:
    What vagrant phantoms, which in false shapes go,
    Stern-ey'd, black-pinion'd, like the gods below!
    But standing forth in false forms or in true,
    For these, for those, a Virgin's dread is due.
    Come then, come, Cynthia, with resounding bow,
    And clang thy full-charg'd quiver at the foe.
    These monsters, those, thy darts unerring share,
    Nor truer aim thy brother's arrows bear:
    Come, then, O come, with all thy face a-flame,
    Worthy thyself to take Apollo's name.
    Thou know'st how Phoebus' sister ought to shine;
    If not, learn, Cynthia, from these cheeks divine.
    Placed here thy torch more beauty would display,
    And Night from hence prefer to draw its day;
    Such moon more modest shed its silent beam,
    And shamefac'd stay her softly-going team.
    O Moon, thy day no rose so chaste resembles,
    Thy torch with no such virgin beauty trembles.
    Come then, but bring thy troops of stars likewise;
    For they can try to shine like the Child's eyes.
    An eye, a star, twinkling with equal grace,
    The face of heaven and the Child's heavenly face.
    How well the charm of each transferr'd would show,
    From hand to hand the mutual sceptres go!
    Whether heaven's eye should deck His skiey brow,
    Or the Child's star adorn heaven's forehead now.
    If the Child's star on heaven's forehead shone,
    That eye would seem to Him not less His own.
    Place on His skiey forehead heaven's eye,
    Not less 'twould deem itself in its own sky.
    Such interchanges might the stars and skies
    Make charmingly with the Child's brow and eyes.
    For change of place the stars indeed might like
    An everlasting treaty now to strike;
    And differing though in numbers, e'en the skies
    Might wish to bargain for a change of eyes.
    With how much better stars the sky would shine,
    If as its stars it had these eyes divine!
    The stars would shine in how much better heaven,
    If as their sky this brow divine were given!
    So sky and stars may choose--in vain they choose;
    For the Child's brow and His fair eyes refuse.
    Ah, wisely; for these eyes what better heaven
    Could wish? what better stars to brow be given?
    What though some gentle star more softly gleams?
    What if heaven's way thrice, four times, milky seems?
    Softer this eye which smiles in ruddy face;
    This milk-white brow, thrice, four times is its grace.
    To quit their heaven, let then these stars deny;
    Stars ought not to be ta'en from their own sky.
    They do deny; and soon in cloud are hid,
    In tender shadow of the drooping lid.
    Nor with their own defence content they rest,
    But seek a hiding-place in mother's breast.
    Thus the snow melts where His warm touch is plac'd,
    And genial Spring blooms out of Winter chaste.
    Such day such evening-dew deserves to drink;
    Such suns in such a bed deserve to sink.
    Sky-closing Eve, thy purple veil entwine,
    Sun, thy luxurious couch incarnadine;
    While wanton Thetis day too early closes,
    Thy shameless bed place 'mid Hesperian roses;
    Roses, forsooth, by conscious blushes painted,
    By sin with its own tell-tale redness tainted.
    Nights snowy-white, chaste couch to these suns be,
    Which virgin Thetis spreads o'er lucent sea;
    All-holy flowers, lilies inviolate,
    Roses with innocent blush upon them wait.
    Be theirs this bosom, where reclin'd all night
    They bathe themselves in ocean milky-white.
    And let them bathe, till their own morn say, rise;
    And Day itself drink splendour from these eyes.   R. WI.

_Non dico, me rogaturum Patrem pro vobis._ Joan. xvi. 26.

    Ille suos omni facie te figit amores;

_I do not say that I will pray the Father for you._

    Yea, Lord, ask Thou: He is not wont to be,
    He cannot prove unkind, if ask'd of Thee.
    With favouring eyes He makes Thee all His love;
    Toward Thine heart, Lord, His whole affections move.
    Beholding Thy fair eyes Himself He sees;
    In Thy pure breast Himself He cherishes.
    By Thee He metes Himself, His godhead learns,
    And, sweet reversion! to Himself returns.
    He Thee, Thou He, in one Ye intertwine;
    He is His own no more, He is so Thine.
    Yea, Lord, ask Thou: He is not wont to be,
    He cannot prove unkind, if ask'd of Thee.
    Shall these lips, Lord, ask Him? But how should they?
    With rightful words and pure they fail to pray.
    If I should ask Him, then, what tempests dread,
    What anger thundering o'er this wretched head!
    His look perchance would gleam as lightning down--
    Yea, oft, I know, as lightning falls His frown.
    Perchance the javelin of one angry word,
    One nod, would slay, and I should die unheard.
    I? I'll not ask: Lord, He is wont to be,
    He easy proves unkind, if ask'd of me.
    Yet, stay: I'll ask:--not with these lips of mine;
    Yea, with my lips,--my lips, Lord, namely Thine.      A.

NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.

These Secular, or, as the word was, 'Humane' Epigrams, all originally
appeared in the volume of 1646, as before, and were continued in the
after-editions. It is pleasant to have this recognition of John Ford
(I.) by Crashaw. The two Tragedies celebrated, appeared in the same
year, 1633. The 'Faire Ethiopian' of II. was doubtless William Lisle's
poem so named [Lond. 1632],--not given by Hazlitt, _s.n._ The others are
too well known to need annotation. These are all preserved, with a
collection of others, in the Tanner MS., as before. G.

NOTE.

It is my great privilege to be the first to print the following
extensive additions to the _Epigrammata Sacra_ of Crashaw. They are
wholly derived from Archbishop Sancroft's MS. in the Bodleian, as
described in our Preface (Vol. I. p. xx.-xxiii.) and in the Preface to
the present Volume. For their relation to those published by the Author
himself and in the editions of 1634 and 1670, see our Essay, as before.
As with Crashaw's own collection (of 1634), the Epigrams seem to have
been composed and written down on the spur of the moment as a subject
struck him, and hence there is the same absence of arrangement: nor is
it much to be lamented, seeing that each is independent. As a rule, I
follow the order of the manuscript. For translations of fifteen of these
fifty-five Epigrams, viz. Nos. 8, 9, 19, 24, 26, 32, 34, 35, 39, 46, 48,
49, 51, 52, 53, and 55, I am indebted, as for so much more throughout,
to my excellent poet-friend the Rev. RICHARD WILTON, M.A., as before:
for the others, in Fuller's phrase, 'my meanness is responsible,' except
in a few instances wherein Crashaw has himself furnished renderings, or
at least little poems less or more corresponding with the Latin; as
pointed out in the places. G.

Act. xxviii. 3.

    Paule, nihil metuas, non fert haec vipera virus:
      Virtutem vestrae vult didicisse manus.
    Oscula, non morsus; supplex, non applicat hostis.
      Nec metuenda venit, sed miseranda magis.

_St. Paul and the viper._

    Paul, fear thou nought; no poison bears this asp:
      It seeks to learn the virtue of thy hand.
    Not as a foe, but suppliant, it would clasp;
      Not fear, but pity, it would fain command.          G.

Joan. vi. 14, 26.

    Jam credunt, Deus es: Deus est, qui teste palato,
      Quique ipso demum est judice dente Deus.
    Scilicet haec sapiunt miracula: de quibus alvus
      Proficere, et possit pingue latus fluere.
    Haec sua fecisti populo miracula credunt.
      Gens pia, et in ventrem relligiosa suum!

_The miracle of the loaves._

    Now truly they believe that Thou art God!--
      God witnessed by palate and by tooth!--
    They know the smack of miracles that load
      And swell their paunches; yea, believe, forsooth.
    To a most pious race, Lord, Thou appealest,
    And stomachs most believing Thou revealest.           G.

_In lacrymas Christi patientis._

    Saeve dolor! potes hoc? oculos quoque perpluis istos?
      O quam non meritas haec arat unda genas!
    O lacrymas ego flere tuas, ego dignior istud,
      Quod tibi cunque cadit roris, habere meum.
    Siccine? me tibi flere tuas! ah, mi bone Jesu,
      Si possem lacrymas vel mihi flere meas!
    Flere meas? immo immo tuas, hoc si modo possem:
      Non possem lacrymas, non ego flere meas.
    Flere tuas est flere meas, tua lacryma, Christe,
      Est mea vel lacryma est si tua, causa mea est.

_Of the tears of the suffering Christ._

    O cruel Pain! I ask thee how
    Thou canst do what thou'rt doing now?
    Dost thou also--or is't my fears?--
    Drench His sweet eyes with scalding tears?
    O how that show'r furrows amain
    His undeserving cheek, as rain!
    More meet it were that I should know
    The tears that from His anguish flow:
    More meet it were that I should feel
    All dews that down His wan cheek steal:
    O is it thus? Would that it were!
    That I might weep Thy laden tear:
    Yea, blessed Jesus, would that I
    For mine own self could weeping lie:
    Mine own tears weep? nay, they are Thine,
    For all Thy tears, alas, are mine.
    Ah, not a tear that Thou didst shed,
    When sorrow bow'd Thy sacred head,
    But came of human woe or guilt,
    For which at last Thy Blood was spilt;
    And even if the tears were Thine,
    Being for my sake, they're rather mine.               G.

_In sepulcrum Domini._ Joan. xix. 38-42.

    Jam cedant, veteris cedant miracula saxi,
      Unde novus subito fluxerat amne latex.
    Tu felix rupes, ubi se lux tertia tollet,
      Flammarum sacro fonte superba flues.

_The sepulchre of the Lord._

    Yield place, ye wonders of the ancient stone
      Whence sudden-gushing streams were seen to flow:
    When the third day, blest rock, on thee has shone,
      Proudly with fount of sacred fire thou'lt glow.     G.

_Ubi amorem praecipit._ Joan. xiii. 14.

    Sic magis in numeros morituraque carmina vivit
      Dulcior extrema voce caducus olor;
    Ut tu inter strepitus odii, et tua funera, Jesu,
      Totus amor liquido totus amore sonas.

_The parting words of Love._

    E'en as the dying swan, sweeter for failing breath,
      Dies not, but rather lives, in her last wistful song,
    Dost Thou, Lord, mid hate's din and close-approaching death,
      As Love, with melting voice, Thy dying love prolong. G.

Act. xii. 23.

    Euge, Deus--pleno populus fremit undique plausu--
      Certe non hominem vox sonat, euge, Deus!
    Sed tamen iste Deus qui sit, vos dicite, vermes,
      Intima turba illi; vos fovet ille sinu.

_Herod devoured of worms._

    Behold a god! full-voic'd the people cry;
      Not man, but god, with shouts they him attest.
    What kind of god he is, ye worms, reply--
      A crowd that know the secrets of his breast.        G.

_Bonum est nobis esse hic._

    Why seek'st thou, drowsy Peter, here to stay?
    Elsewhere such pleasant dreams thou see'st not, eh?[88] G.

_Videte lilia agrorum ... nec Salomon, &c._ Matt. vi. 29.

    Candide rex campi, cui floris eburnea pompa est,
      Deque nivis fragili vellere longa toga;
    Purpureus Salomon impar tibi dicitur esto.
      Nempe, quod est melius, par fuit ille rosis.

_Look on the lilies of the field ... not Solomon, &c._

    O fairest monarch of the enamell'd field,
      Whose is the blossom'd pomp of ivory splendour,
    And whose the fleeces, snowy-white, which yield
      Long-flowing robes immaculate and tender.
    Ah, not like lilies--'tis divinely spoken--
      Was Solomon, with sin encrimsoned;
    But not unlike--and 'tis a better token--
      Roses tear-wash'd, which hang the blushing head.  R. WI.

Marc. vii. 33, 36.

    Voce manuque simul linguae tu, Christe, ciendae:
      Sistendae nudis vocibus usus eras.
    Sane at lingua equus est pronis effusus habenis:
      Vox ciet, at sistit non nisi tota manus.


_The deaf healed._

    To wake the tongue--voice, hand too, Christ would use;
      To check it, but a bare word of command.
    Really, the tongue is as a horse rein'd-loose--
      Starts at a word, stay'd only with strong hand.  R. WI.


X.

_In beatae Virginis verecundiam._

    Non est hoc matris, sed, crede, modestia nati,
      Quod virgo in gremium dejicit ora suum.
    Illic jam Deus est, oculus jam Virginis ergo,
      Ut coelum videat, dejiciendus erit.

_The modesty of the blessed Virgin._

    Not humbleness of mother, but of Child,
    Shines in the downward gaze of Virgin mild.
    The Virgin gazes where her God doth lie:
    She must look down that Heaven may meet her eye.      G.


XI.

_Mitto vos sicut agnos in medio luporum._

    Hos quoque, an hos igitur saevi lacerabitis agnos?
      Hic saltem, hic vobis non licet esse lupis.
    At sceleris nulla est clementia, at ergo scietis,
      Agnus qui nunc est, est aliquando Leo.

_I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves._

    These lambs also, e'en these, will ye, then, fiercely tear?
    Here to be wolves, at least here, ye will never dare.
    Alas, the wicked still are cruel; but ye'll learn
    He Who is now a Lamb will one day Lion turn.          G.


XII.

_Christus a daemone vectus._ Matt. iv.

    Ergo ille, angelicis o sarcina dignior alis,
      Praepete sic Stygio, sic volet ille vehi.
    Pessime! nec laetare tamen tu scilicet inde,
      Non minus es daemon, non minus ille Deus.

_Christ carried by the devil._

    Will He--O burden worthier angels' wings!--
      Deign to be carried by swift fiend of hell?
    Vilest! to thee this no advancement brings;
      He no less God, thou no less demon fell.            G.


XIII.

Joan. i. 23.

    Vox ego sum, dicis: tu vox es, sancte Joannes?
      Si vox es, sterilis cur tibi mater erat?
    Quam fuit ista tuae mira infoecundia matris!
      In vocem sterilis rarior esse solet.

_St. John the Baptist a voice._

    'I am a voice, a voice,' says holy John.
      If so, how should thy mother barren be?
    This is unfruitfulness to muse upon;
      Tongue-barren women we so seldom see!               G.


XIV.

_Vox Joannes, Christus Verbum._

    Monstrat Joannes Christum, haud res mira videtur:
      Vox unus, verbum scilicet alter erat.
    Christus Joanne est prior, haec res mira videtur:
      Voce sua verbum non solet esse prius.

_John the Voice, Christ the Word._

    John points out Christ; no wonder this we deem:
      One is a Voice, the other is the Word.
    Christ is before John; wondrous this may seem;
      For when was word before a voice e'er heard?        G.


XV.

_In natales Domini pastoribus nuntiatos._ Luc. ii. 8-19.

    Ad te sydereis, ad te, bone Tityre, pennis
      Purpureus juvenis gaudia tanta vehit.
    O bene te vigilem, cui gaudia tanta feruntur,
      Ut neque dum vigilas, te vigilare putes.
    Quem sic monstrari voluit pastoribus aether,
      Pastor an agnus erat? Pastor et agnus erat.
    Ipse Deus cum Pastor erit, quis non erit agnus?
      Quis non pastor erit, cum Deus agnus erit?

_On the birth of the Lord announced to the shepherds._

    To thee, good Tityrus, on starry wings        _shepherd_
    The royal angel such 'glad tidings' brings.
    Surely the happy watcher never thought
    That he was watching when such joys were brought.
    And He, Whom thus the heavenly host reveal'd
    To shepherds 'mid their flocks in open field,
    Tell me, was He a Shepherd or a Lamb?
    Shepherd and Lamb at once; He took each name.
    Since, then, our God a Shepherd's name doth wear,
    The name of lamb who will not wish to bear?
    And who will not be shepherd, since God deigns
    To be a Lamb, for suffering of sin's pains?           G.

_In Atheniensem merum._ Act. xvii. 28.

    Ipsos naturae thalamos sapis, imaque rerum
      Concilia, et primae quicquid agunt tenebrae,
    Quid dubitet refluum mare, quid vaga sydera volvant;
      Christus et est studiis res aliena tuis.
    Sic scire, est tantum nescire loquacius illa:
      Qui nempe illa sapit sola, nec illa sapit.

_Of the 'blue-blood' pride of the Athenians._

    Thou knowest Nature's secret things
    And all her deepest counsellings--
    All wonders of the primal Night
    Conceal'd from prying human sight;
    Knowest how the sea-tide pauses,
    The wandering stars too in their causes.
    But while to thee, in all else wise,
    Christ from thy thoughts an alien lies,
    In earthly studies to advance
    Is but loquacious ignorance;
    And he whose wisdom is but such,
    Of those things even knows not much.
    O, study thou beneath the Cross,
    Or all thy labour is but loss!                        G.


XVII.

_Ego vitis vera._ Joan. xv. 1.

    Credo quidem, sed et hoc hostis te credidit ipse
      Caiaphas, et Judas credidit ipse, reor.
    Unde illis, Jesu, vitis nisi vera fuisses,
      Tanta tui potuit sanguinis esse sitis?

_I am the True Vine._

    'Believe!' e'en Caiaphas, thy foe, believed
      Thee the True Vine; and Judas too, I think.
    Had they not, Lord, Thee as True Vine received,
      Could they have thirsted so Thy Blood to drink?     G.

_Abscessum Christi queruntur Discipuli._

    Ille abiit, jamque o quae nos mala cunque manetis,
      Sistite jam in nostras tela parata neces.
    Sistite; nam quibus haec vos olim tela paratis,
      Abscessu Domini jam periere sui.

_The departure of Christ lamented by the Disciples._

    The Lord is gone; and now, all evils dire,
      Hold back the darts which for our death you flourish:
    Yea, hold them back, nor waste on us your ire,
      For with our Lord's departure, lo, we perish.       G.

_In descensum Spiritus Sancti._ Act. ii. 1-4.

    Quae vehit auratos nubes dulcissima nimbos?
      Quis mitem pluviam lucidus imber agit?
    Agnosco, nostros haec nubes abstulit ignes:
      Haec nubes in nos jam redit igne pari.
    O nubem gratam et memorem, quae noluit ultra
      Tam saeve de se nos potuisse queri!
    O bene; namque alio non posset rore rependi,
      Coelo exhalatum quod modo terra dedit.

_On the descent of the Holy Spirit._

    What sweetest cloud comes wafting golden shower?
    What gentle raindrops bring their shining dower?
    The cloud which stole our flame, our heart's desire,
    This very cloud returns with equal fire.
    O kindly-mindful cloud, which could not brook
    That we should mourn thee with so sad a look!
    'Tis well; no other dew had countervail'd
    That which from earth to heaven was late exhal'd.  R. WI.

Act. x. 39.

    Quis malus appendit de mortis stipite vitam?
      O malus agricola, hoc inseruisse fuit?
    Immo, quis appendit vitae hac ex arbore mortem?
      O bonus Agricola, hoc inseruisse fuit.
    What wicked one affix'd Life to Death's tree?
      O wretched gard'ner, call'st thou this engrafting?
    Nay, tell me who affix'd Death to Life's tree?
      O noble Gard'ner, this I call engrafting.           G.

_Ego sum Ostium._ Joan. x. 9.

    Jamque pates, cordisque seram gravis hasta reclusit,
      Et clavi claves undique te reserant.
    Ah, vereor, sibi ne manus impia clauserit illas,
      Quae coeli has ausa est sic aperire fores.

_I am the Doore._

    And now th' art set wide ope; the speare's sad art,
    Lo, hath unlockt Thee at the very heart.
    He to himselfe--I feare the worst--
          And his owne hope,
    Hath shut these doores of heaven, that durst
          Thus set them ope.                             CR.

ANOTHER VERSION.

    Now Thou art open wide; the barrier dear
    Of Thy great heart unclos'd by cruel spear;
    And nails as keys unlock Thee everywhere.
    Ah, he whose wicked hand thus forc'd the gate
    Of heaven, perhaps at heaven's shut door will wait
    One day, with outer darkness for his fate.            G.

_In spinas demtas a Christi capite cruentatas._

    Accipe, an ignoscis? de te sata germina, miles.
      Quam segeti est messis discolor illa suae!
    O quae tam duro gleba est tam grata colono?
      Inserit hic spinas: reddit et illa rosas.

_Upon the thornes taken downe from our Lord's head bloody._

    Knowst thou this, souldier? 'tis a much-chang'd plant, which yet
                          Thyselfe didst set;
    'Tis chang'd indeed: did Autumn e're such beauties bring
                          To shame his Spring?
    O, who so hard an husbandman could ever find
                          A soyle so kind?
    Is not the soile a kind one, thinke ye, that returnes
                          Roses for thornes?             CR.

ANOTHER VERSION.

    Take, soldier--know'st them not?--thy planted germs;
      A harvest how unlike to its seed-corn!
    What soil yields husbandman such kindly terms?
      The rose he gathers, where he planted thorn.        G.

Joan. iii. 1-21.

    Nox erat, et Christum, Doctor male docte, petebas
      In Christo tenebras depositure tuas.
    Ille autem multo dum te bonus irrigat ore,
      Atque per arcanas ducit in alta vias,
    Sol venit, et primo pandit se flore diei,
      Ludit et in dubiis aureus horror aquis.
    Sol oritur; sed adhuc, et adhuc tamen, o bone, nescis.
      Sol oritur, tecum nox tamen est, et adhuc
           .       .       .       .       .
      Non coeli, illa fuit, nox fuit illa tua.

_Nicodemus._

    'Twas night; and, Teacher all untaught,
    Thy darkness thou to Christ hast brought
    But while attent He speaks to thee
    Benignant words, that thou mayst see,
    Leading higher still and higher,
    As thy yearnings do aspire,
    Guiding thee, by sure grace given,
    Through secret paths that reach to heaven;
    Lo, the Sun on thee is risen,
    Bursting from his cloudy prison,
    Showing Him, the Life, the Way,
    Flushing with first bloom of day,
    Quivering with a golden light
    Such as on wav'ring seas gleams bright.
    The Sun is risen; yet darkness lies,
    Good Nicodemus, on thine eyes;
    But the night's thine own; for, lo,
    All heav'n above doth lustrous glow.                  G.

      Sed quem uri lictor credidit, unctus erat.
    Te quoque sic olei virtus malefida fefellit?
      Sic tua te Pallas, Domitiane, juvat?

_To Domitian, concerning St. John commanded to be cast into a caldron of

    Behold the Saint anointed unawares!
    With such elusive virtue was the oil fraught!
    Such aid thy olive-loving Pallas brought![89]     R. WI.

    Ecce autem Verbum est unum tantum ille loquutus:
      Uno sed Verbo cuncta loquutus erat.

_The voice of the Baptist._

    The Baptist had to speak such floods of things,
      That well he might be Voice and nothing more:
    But one word only, lo, Christ speaks, which brings
      In one word all: My soul that Word adore!           G.

      Mors tibi et Herodes nonne dedisset idem?

_On St. Peter loosed by the angel._

    Death, Herod, press on thee; when angel's wing

    What gave he thee? Thy chains burst at his touch;
    But Death and Herod would have given as much.     R. WI.

_On St. Peter casting away his nets at our Saviour's call._

    Thou hast the art on't, Peter, and canst tell
    To cast thy nets on all occasions well.
    When Christ calls, and thy nets would have thee stay,
    To cast them well's to cast them quite away.         CR.

ANOTHER VERSION.

    At the Lord's word thy nets were cast away:
      Never before thy nets so well were cast.
    Rightly to cast them is to cast away,
      When once The Master's order has been pass'd.       G.

    Ah melius, pugiles quis enim commiserit istos?

_The Lamb of God, Who bears away the sins of the world._

    Shall He, then, be a Lamb, to go
    Forth against such various foe?
    Lions ravenous, great of jaw;
    Wolves in vast herds, of mighty paw;
    Pards vengeful, prowling out and in--
    Frightful, num'rous as my sin--
    Awful of face, and gaunt and grim,
    Merciless to mangle limb by limb.
    Ah, goest Thou, gentle One, 'gainst these?
    And does terror upon Thee seize?
    O how unequal is the strife,
    And the prey so grand a life!
    With such as these to fight art fated?
    Nor in arms nor passion mated.                        G.

_Lord, not my feet only, but also my head, &c._

    'Behold my head, behold my face,
    Which sin's filthiest stains deface:
    Here pour Thy streams:' thou say'st to Me.

    For ere the cock a third time crow,
    Rivers of its own tears must flow.                    G.

_Though they beheld so many miracles, they believed not._

    However high in Thy great love Thou wingest,
    And whatsoe'er within Thy hand Thou bringest,
    Against Thee, with its thunders, stands the world,
    Sign answering sign; Sin's banners all unfurl'd.
    Nay--and let not the bold rash word appal--
    One thought o' the world makes all Thy wonders fall:
    Against Thy mightiest signs this one it wields--
    To the vast whole of Thine, no faith it yields.       G.

_On the cloud which received the Lord._

    O, this black cloud! a white breast does it show--
    A breast more white than a swan's neck of snow?
    More bright than golden sunshine let it be!
    However fair itself, 'tis black to me.
    From blacker cloud ne'er issu'd stormy blast,

_He saw the city, and wept over it._

    Why scornest thou My tears, deceitful city?

_His Disciples came and awoke Him._

    What madness this, slumbers so rare to break,
    O ye, for whom even Christ's sleep doth wake!
    If sleep held Him, ye're terrified by dreams--

    Christ's sleep nought injur'd you, indeed 'tis true:
    Your faith's sleep, and that only, injur'd you.   R. WI.

    Nimirum hoc velit ipse, tuo favet ipse triumpho,

_The woman of Canaan._

    Now He yieldeth, now He falleth,
    As thy passion on Him calleth:
    Press thee nigher still and nigher,
    Urge thee higher still and higher;
    Cleave and cling, nor let thy hand
    Cease to plead, nor fearing stand.
    He thy triumph sees with gladness,
    Loves thee in thy clinging sadness;
    Seems thy foe, yet ne'ertheless
    Yearns in His heart of love to bless;
    Willing bears thy every blow,
    That from His own pow'r doth flow;
    Loves to hear thy interceding,
    His own voice within thee pleading.
    Ah, this seeming en'my of thine,
    Of fierceness giveth thee no sign;
    For Love no grim soldier is,
    Rough and severe, denying bliss.
    Eas'ly is that victory won,
    When the foe seeks to be undone.                      G.

_Wherefore eateth your Master with sinners, &c._

    Dost loathe thy brother, Pharisee,

    And knowest not that all men see
      Disease to thee more deadly clings?

_To St. Luke the physician._

    This life my sins with wretchedness make rife,
    Physicians by their art prolong this life.
    Is this to live long time? I hear one sigh;
    This is but fearing a long time to die.
    Thy leaves, Physician blest, medicines contain
    E'en for our medicines poor, our chiefest bane.
    This is to escape death well--in death to lie;

    Nonne hic est, dum sic digito patet ille fideli,
      Tunc cum vestitus, tunc quoque nudus Amor?

_Touched the hem of His garment._

    Erringly, painter, thou portrayst Love bare:
    Not bare you make him, though no clothes he wear.
    Here, while laid open to believing hand,
    Though clothed indeed, bare truly see Him stand.   R. WI.

    Tolle oculos, tolle, o tecum tua sydera nostros.
      Ah quid enim, quid agant hic sine sole suo?
    Id quod agant sine sole suo tua sydera, coelum:
      Id terrae haec agerent hic sine sole suo.
    Illa suo sine sole suis caeca imbribus essent:
      Caeca suis lacrymis haec sine sole suo.

_The departing Saviour._

    O take, take with Thee, Lord, Thy stars, our eyes;
      What would they do left here without their sun?
    E'en what your sunless stars would do, ye skies,
      Would here by sunless stars of earth be done.
    Without their sun, those dark with showers we see;
    These without sun, dark with their tears would be.  R. WI.

_Nam ego non solum vinciri, &c._ Act. xxi. 13.

    Quid mortem objicitis nostro, quid vinc'la timori?
      Non timor est illinc, non timor inde meus.
    Vincula, quae timeam, sunt vincula sola timoris:
      Sola timenda mihi est mors, timuisse mori.

_Paul unfearing._

    Why talk of death or bonds to me,
    As if these things a fear could be?
    My fear springeth not from thence;
    Nor in these is influence
    Me to trouble or alarm,
    Me to fret, or me to harm.
    The only bonds that fearful are
    Are the bonds themselves of fear;
    The only death looks dreadfully,
    Is lest I should fear to die.                         G.

_The message of the Baptist to Christ._

    I ask, Who art Thou? is the Baptist's word.

NOTE.

    Whether intentionally, or with his usual carelessness, the two
    following important and characteristic Poems are not given in
    Turnbull's edition; and they seem entirely to have escaped the
    knowledge of even admirers of Crashaw. They appeared originally in
    the 'Steps of the Temple' of 1648 (pp. 103-105), and were naturally
    excluded from the Paris collection of 1652, and overlooked in the
    edition of 1670. See their biographic significance in our Essay in
    the present Volume. For the second translation (viz. of Baptismus
    &c.) I tender thanks to my good friend Rev. J.H. Clark, M.A., as
    before; the other and somewhat difficult one (Fides &c.) I have
    myself done. G.




FIDES, QUAE SOLA JUSTIFICAT,
NON EST SINE SPE ET DILECTIONE.


    Nam neque tam sola est. O quis male censor amarus
      Jam socias negat in mutua sceptra manus?
    Deme Fidem; nec aget, nec erit jam nomen Amoris:
      Et vel erit, vel aget quid sine Amore Fides?
    Ergo, Amor, i, morere; i, magnas, Puer alme, per umbras     5
      Elysiis non tam numen inane locis.
    O bene, quod pharetra hoc saltem tua praestat et arcus,
      Ne tibi in extremos sit pyra nulla rogos!
    O bene, quod tuus has saltem tibi providet ignis,
      In tu quas possis funera ferre faces!                    10
    Durus es, ah, quisquis tam dulcia vincula solvis;
      Quae ligat, et quibus est ipse ligatus Amor.
    O bene junctarum divortia saeva sororum,
      Tam penitus mixtas quae tenuere manus!
    Nam quae, tam varia, in tam mutua viscera vivunt?          15
      Aut ubi, quae duo sunt, tam prope sunt eadem?
    Alternis sese circum amplectuntur in ulnis:
      Extraque et supra, subter et intus eunt.
    Non tam Nympha tenax, Baccho jam mista marito,
      Abdidit in liquidos mascula vina sinus.                  20
    Compare jam dempto, saltem sua murmura servat
      Turtur, et in viduos vivit amara modos.
    At Fidei sit demptus Amor; non illa dolebit,
      Non erit impatiens aegraque; jam moritur.
    Palma, marem cui tristis hyems procul abstulit umbram,     25
      Protinus in viridem procubuit faciem?
    Undique circumfert caput, omnibus annuit Euris;
      Siqua maritalem misceat aura comam:
    Ah misera, expectat longum, lentumque expirat,
      Et demum totis excutitur foliis.                         30
    At sine Amore Fides nec tantum vivere perstat,
      Quo dici possit vel moritura Fides.
    Mortua jam nunc est: nisi demum mortua non est
      Corporea haec, anima deficiente, domus.
    Corpore ab hoc Fidei hanc animam si demis Amoris,          35
      Jam tua sola quidem est, sed male sola Fides.
    Hectore ab hoc, currus quem jam nunc sentit Achillis,
      Hectora eum speres quem modo sensit herus?
    Tristes exuvias, Oetaei frusta furoris,
      Vanus, in Alcidae nomen et acta vocas?                   40
    Vel satis in monstra haec, plus quam Nemeaea, malorum
      Hoc Fidei torvum et triste cadaver erit?
    Immo, Fidem usque suos velut ipse Amor ardet amores;
      Sic in Amore fidem comprobat ipsa Fides.

ERGO:

    Illa Fides vacua quae sola superbiat aula,                 45
      Quam Spes desperet, quam nee amabit Amor;
    Sola Fides haec, tam misere, tam desolate
      Sola, quod ad nos est, sola sit usque licet.
    A sociis quae sola suis, a se quoque sola est.
      Quae sibi tam nimia est, sit mihi nulla Fides.           50

TRANSLATION.

FAITH, WHICH ALONE JUSTIFIES,

EXISTS NOT WITHOUT HOPE AND LOVE.

    That Faith which only justifies
    A sinner as in guilt he lies,
    Bow'd aneath the awful blood,
    Clinging to the uplifted rood,
    Is not alone so as nor Love
    Nor heavenly Hope may in it move,
    To thrill with touch of ecstasy
    The bruised heart, the swimming eye.
      What, censor! bitter to ill end,
    Dost thou thy dogma still defend?
    And wouldest thou to hands allied
    Mutual sceptres see denied,
    Snapping betwixt Faith and Love
    The tie that binds them from Above?
    I tell thee nay, stone-hearted one,
    The Faith of Christ is not alone:
    Take Faith away, and Love will sigh;
    Take Hope away, and Faith will die;
    Take Faith away, Love will do naught;
    Take Love away, and Faith's distraught:
    For I tell thee, vain sophister,
    They're as sister unto sister.
      But mark, this Love that brings Faith joy
    Is not blind Cupid. Ah, bright Boy,
    Begone; thou shalt not, wouldst thou, stay;
    Go, get thee swift from light o' day;
    Go, get thee now to the vast shades,
    And there indulge thy escapades:
    Thou in Elysian realms mayst reign
    A fitting deity, not vain:
    Go therefore, and with thee thy bow
    And quiver. Well it is below
    That these for thee shall form a pyre,
    To which thy torch will furnish fire.
      But, ah, thou hast a heart of stone,
    Who wouldest make Faith live alone,
    Loos'ning the sweet ties Love has found
    To bind Faith to her, herself bound.
    O, it is cruel thus to sever
    Sisters whom God hath joined ever;
    Whose clasped hands so closely cling,
    E'en as vine-tendrils ring on ring:
    You may not tell there's more than one,
    So absolute the union.
    Where shall you find beneath the sky
    Two differing so variously,
    And yet each life in other bound,
    Touch one, the other you shall wound:
    Or where, 'mid all the pairs on earth,
    Twins through marriage or through birth,
    Shall you find two so truly one?
    Arms twining in affection,
    They clasp each other, chin to chin,
    Above, below, without, within,
    Embracing and embrac'd by turns;
    Yet not with such wild-fire as burns
    In Lust's hot touch, and clasp and grasp
    Eager and stinging as tongue of asp.
    Not so closely interwine
    The graceful Elm and clinging Vine,
    When to bosom of the tree
    Bacchus' clusters prest you see,
    And the Nymph the fruit receives,
    And hides it amid dewy leaves;
    Ev'n as the poets tell of old,
    In legends of the Age of Gold.
      Faith and Love know no such flame,
    Their pure twining brings no shame;
    Look for taint, you'll find it missing:
    'Tis as flower flower kissing;
    Or twin-roses dewy dripping,
    And twin-bees their honey sipping.
      The Turtle-dove, robb'd of her mate,
    Pines and mourns disconsolate;
    Yet still lives on in widow'd grief,
    Knowing at times Hope's sweet relief.
    But Faith when once of Love bereft
    Loses her all, has nothing left;
    Nor mourns nor frets nor pales--she's dead,
    Struck to the heart astonied.
      The Palm that by the wintry blast
    Sees her companion-tree downcast,
    Whose mighty shadow o'er her threw
    Protection when the fierce storm blew;
    Her umbrage sheds, and quivering
    Seeks that some fav'ring wind would bring
    Her branches with his boughs to mingle,
    Since she is left in sadness, single;
    Wretched, she wears and wastes away,
    Leaf following leaf in wan decay,
    Until at last, naked and bare,
    She shivers in the piercing air;
    And when the Spring comes, Winter sped,
    'Tis vain to call her--she is dead!
      But when Love from Faith is gone,
    Faith lingers not still on and on;
    That while her form yet meets your eye,
    You can pronounce 'She'll surely die.'
    SHE'S DEAD i' the instant: or you will
    Maintain a stark corpse liveth still,
    Whose soul has pass'd beyond the sky,
    Sunder'd until the last great Cry.
    Faith is the body, Love the soul;
    Take Love from it, you take the whole:
    Now, now indeed thy Faith's alone,
    But being alone, lo, it is none.
    To make it clear, turn Homer's page
    That paints Achilles' hate and rage,
    When, having mighty Hector slain,
    He dragg'd him dead over the plain--
    That Hector whom the chariot feels
    Dragg'd helpless, lifeless at its wheels,
    Was it the same who, with proud crest,
    That chariot's lord had lately prest,
    Eager the victory to wrest?
    Hercules' name and deeds dost see
    In Oeta's bloody tragedy,
    When dead the mighty hero lay,
    Of jealousy the poison'd prey.
    His living strength the lion slew,
    And hide Nemaean round him threw:
    'Gainst more than lion-rage of Death
    Dost summon the sad corpse of Faith?
    Sure Love with love for Faith will burn,
    While Faith herself trusts Love in turn.

THEREFORE:

    That Faith alone, lording it high,
    Which Hope despairs of, and with cry
      Of anguish Love can never love,
      Is not the Faith sent from Above:
      The Faith that thus would be alone,
      What is't to us--desolate, lone?
      Faith then, that loved will not love
      Nor hope--may no such Faith me move!
      But ever in my bosom lie
      Faith, Hope, and Love in trinity:
    Yea, Love himself shall Faith's best lover prove,
    And Faith confirm his strongest faith in Love.        G.


BAPTISMUS NON TOLLIT FUTURA PECCATA.

    Quisquis es ille tener modo quem tua mater[93] Achilles
      In Stygis aethereae provida tinxit aquis,
    Sanus, sed non securus dimitteris illinc:
      In nova non tutus vulnera vivis adhuc.
    Mille patent aditus; et plus quam calce petendus            5
      Ad nigri metues spicula mille dei.
    Quod si est vera salus, veterem meminisse salutem;
      Si nempe hoc vere est esse, fuisse pium;
    Illa tibi veteres navis quae vicerat Austros,
      Si manet in mediis usque superstes aquis;                10
    Ac dum tu miseros in littore visis amicos,
      Et peccatorum triste sodalitium,
    Illa tibi interea tutis trahet otia velis,
      Expectans donec tu rediisse queas:
    Quin igitur da vina, puer; da vivere vitae;                15
      Mitte suum senibus, mitte supercilium;
    Donemus timide, o socii, sua frigora brumae:
      Aeternae teneant hic nova regna rosae.
    Ah, non tam tetricos sic eluctabimur Euros;
      Effractam non est sic revocare ratem.                    20
    Has undas aliis decet ergo extinguere in undis;
      Naufragium hoc alio immergere naufragio:
    Possit ut ille malis oculus modo naufragus undis,
      Jam lacrymis melius naufragus esse suis.

BAPTISM CANCELS NOT AFTER-SINS.

    O young Achilles, whom a mother's care
      Hath dipp'd as in a sacred Stygian wave;
    Whole, but yet not secure, thou hence dost fare,
      For there are wounds from which it will not save.
    A thousand ways of entrance open lie
      For evil; not alone against thy heel
    The prince of darkness in his rage lets-fly
      The thousand arrows thou mayst dread to feel.
    But if remember'd health may still have given
      True health, and to have been is still to be,
    Thou seem'st as one whose bark, by storms unriven,
      Still rides, as yet unconquer'd, on the sea;
    And, while on shore thy friends thou visitest,
      And the sad company of them that sin,
    With furled sails upon the waves at rest,
      Thy bark floats idly till thou art within.
    But if for this thou criest overbold,
      'Bring wine! enjoy the moment as it goes;
    Leave to old age its cares; dismiss the cold,
      While in new realms for ever reigns the rose!'
    Ah, know that not in revels such as these
      Learn we to struggle with the spiteful gale;
    Nor thus can hope to rescue from rough seas
      The broken cable and the driven sail.
    These waves must in another wave be wash'd,
      This shipwreck in another shipwreck drown'd;
    The eye in such ill storms so vilely dashed,
      A happier wreck in its own tears be found.         CL.

    The Sancroft MS., as before, furnishes the following hitherto

PSALMUS I.


    O te te nimis et nimis beatum,
    Quem non lubricus implicavit error;
    Nec risu misero procax tumultus.
    Tu cum grex sacer undique execrandis
    Strident consiliis, nec aure felix;
    Felix non animo, vel ore mixtus,
    Haud intelligis impios susurros.
    Sed tu deliciis ferox repostis
    Cultu simplice, sobriaque cura
    Legem numinis usque et usque volvis.
    Laeta sic fidas colit arbor undas,
    Quem immiti violentus aura
    Seirius frangit, neque contumacis.

NOTE.

    This fragment of a Latin rendering of the first Psalm may be
    compared with BUCHANAN'S, but, I fear, not to its advantage. It were
    superfluous to give a translation of it; but see the parallel which
    follows. G.


IRA PROCELLAE.

    At tu, profane pulvis, et lusus sacer
    Cujusvis aurae; fronte qua tandem feres
    Vindex tribunal? quanta tum, et qualis tuae
    Moles procellae stabit? O quam ferreo
    Frangere nutu, praeda frontis asperae,
    Sacrique fulminandus ah procul, procul
    A luce vultus, aureis procul a locis,
    Ubi longa gremio mulcet aeterno pios.
    Sincera semper pax, et umbrosa super
    Insurgit ala, vividique nectaris
    Imbres beatos rore perpetuo pluit.
    Sic ille, sic, o vindice, stat vigil,
    Et stabit ira torvus in impios,
      Seseque sub mentes bonorum
        Insinuat facili favore.

THE WRATH OF THE JUDGMENT-WHIRLWIND.

    But thou, O dust profane, and of each air
    The plaything doom'd, with what face wilt thou bear
    The Judgment-throne? how huge a stormy cloud
    Will lower upon thee! how wilt thou be bow'd
    With iron nod, the prey of frowning Face,
    By thunder to be driven far off, apace,
    From light of sacred Countenance! afar
    From golden regions, where the righteous are,
    Sooth'd in pure Peace's lap eterne, whose wing
    Towers high above them, overshadowing;
    While happy showers of nectar sweet imbue
    Their lips, as with an everlasting dew.
      The wicked so His watchful ire will learn,
    And cower 'neath God's avenging countenance stern;
    The righteous so His love divine will feel
    With gentle lapse into their bosom steal.         R. WI.


CHRISTE, VENI.

    Ergo veni; quicunque ferant tua signa timores,
      Quae nos cunque vocant tristia, Christe, veni.
    Christe, veni; suus avulsum rapiat labor axem,
      Nec sinat implicitas ire redire vias;
    Mutuus attonito titubet sub foedere mundus,
      Nec natura vagum dissona volvat opus.
    Christe, veni; roseos ultra remeare per ortus
      Nolit, et ambiguos Sol trahat aeger equos.
    Christe, veni; ipsa suas patiatur Cynthia noctes,
      Plus quam Thessalico tincta tremore genas;
    Astrorum mala caesaries per inane dolendum
      Gaudeat, horribili flore repexa caput;
    Sole sub invito subitae vis improba noctis
      Corripiat solitam, non sua jura, diem;
    Importuna dies, nec Eoi conscia pacti,

    Christe, veni; tonet Oceanus pater, et sua nolit

      Fata id agant, quod agant; tu modo, Christe, veni.

      Quanti hoc constiterit cunque venire, veni.

      O tanti est te vel sic potuisse frui!
    Quicquid id est, veniat. TU MODO, CHRISTE, VENI.

EVEN SO: COME, LORD JESUS.

    O come; whatever fears Thy standards carry,
    Or sorrows summon us, Lord, do not tarry.
    Come, Lord; though labouring heaven whirl from its place,
    And its perplexed paths no more can trace;
    Though sympathising earth astonied reel,
    And nature jarred cease its round to wheel.
    Come, Lord; though sun refuse with rosy beam
    To rise, and sickly drives a doubtful team.
    Come, Lord; though moon look more aghast at night
    Than when her cheeks with panic fear are white;
    Though ominous comets through the dolorous air
    Hurtle, and round their brow dread fire-wreaths wear;
    Though spite of struggling sun Night's sudden sway
    Impious and lawless seize the accustom'd day;
    Mistimed Day, mindless of eastern glow,
    Through moanings of forsaken Night should go.
    Come, Lord; though father Ocean roars and lowers,
    That his mov'd mountain-bars own other powers.
    Come, Lord; whate'er Fear dares, e'en let it dare;
    Let Fates do what they will, be Thou but there.
    Come, Lord; with whate'er recompense of ill,
    Whate'er Thy coming cost, O come, Lord, still.
    Thee and Thine eyes, O what 'twill be to see!
    Thee to enjoy e'en so, what will that be!
    Let come what will, do Thou, Lord, only come.     R. WI.


CIRCUMCISIO.

    Ah ferus, ah culter, qui tam bona lilia primus
      In tam crudeles jussit abire rosas;
    Virgineum hoc qui primus ebur violavit ab ostro,
      Inque sui instituit muricis ingenium.
    Scilicet hinc olim quicunque cucurrerit amnis,
      Ex hoc purpurei germine fontis erit.
    Scilicet hunc mortis primum puer accipit unguem,
      Injiciunt hodie fata, furorque manus.
    Ecce illi sanguis fundi jam coepit; et ecce
      Qui fundi possit, vix bene sanguis erat;
    Excitat e dolio vix dum bene musta recenti,
      Atque rudes furias in nova membra vocat.
    Improbus, ut nimias jam nunc accingitur iras,
      Armaque non molli sollicitanda manu;
    Improbus, ut teneras audet jam ludere mortes,
      Et vitae ad modulum, quid puerile mori;
    Improbus, ut tragici impatiens praeludia fati
      Ornat, et in socco jam negat ire suo:
    Scilicet his pedibus manus haec meditata cothurnos?
      Haec cum blanditiis mens meditata minas?
    Haec tam dura brevem decuere crepundia dextram?
      Dextra giganteis haec satis apta genis?
    Sic cunis miscere cruces? cumque ubere matris
      Commisisse neces et scelus et furias?
    Quo ridet patri, hoc tacite quoque respicit hastam,
      Quoque oculo matrem mulcet, in arma redit.
    Dii superi, furit his oculis! hoc asper in ore est!
      Dat Marti vultus, quos sibi mallet Amor.
    Deliciae irarum! torvi, tenera agmina, risus!
      Blande furor! terror dulcis! amande metus!
    Praecocis in paenas pueri lascivia tristis!
      Cruda rudimenta! et torva tyrocinia!
    Jam parcum breviusque brevi pro corpore vulnus,
      Proque brevi brevior vulnere sanguis eat:
    Olim, cum nervi vitaeque ferocior haustus
      Materiam morti luxuriemque dabunt;
    Olim maturos ultro conabitur imbres;
      Robustum audebit tunc solidumque mori.
    Ergo illi, nisi qui in saevos concreverit usus,
      Nec nisi quem possit fundere, sanguis erit?
    Euge, puer trux! euge tamen mitissime rerum!
      Quique tibi tantum trux potes esse, puer?
    Euge tibi trux! euge mihi mitissime rerum!
      Euge Leo mitis! trux sed et Agne tamen!
    Macte, puer, macte hoc tam durae laudis honore!
      Macte, o paenarum hac indole et ingenio!
    Ah ferus, ah culter, sub quo, tam docte dolorum,
      In tristem properas sic, puer, ire virum.
    Ah ferus, ah culter, sub quo, puer auree, crescis,
      Mortis proficiens hac quasi sub ferula.

THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST.

    Ah, fierce, fierce knife, which such sweet lilies first
    Into such cruel roses made to burst;
    Which first this ivory pure with purple stain'd,
    And in the white a deeper dye engrain'd.
    Whatever stream hereafter hence shall flow,
    Out of this purple fountain-head shall grow.
    Now first this tender Child Death's talons knows,
    The Fates and Fury now hurl their first blows.
    See now His blood begins to pour; and see
    Scarce blood enough to pour there seems to be.
    Scarce wise to broach the new wine from the wood,
    And 'gainst those young limbs call the Furies rude.
    Wanton, e'en now He girds on woes too much,
    And arms not to be tried by such soft touch:
    Wanton, He dares at gentle deaths to play,
    And for His age to die, as a child may:
    Wanton, beforehand acts His tragic woe,
    Restless, refusing in child-step to go.
    Buskins is this hand shaping for those feet,
    And does this mind plan threats with coaxings sweet?
    Such playthings stern does this small hand bespeak,
    And is it match'd with giant's iron cheek?
    To mingle cross with cradle, mother's breast
    With slaughter, wickedness, and rage unblest?
    His smiling eye now glances at the spear,
    And turns to arms from soothing mother dear.
    God, with such face to frown, such eyes to rage!
    War wins the looks which Love would fain engage.
    O winsome angers! savage smiles--mild brood--
    Soft rage, sweet terror, awe which might be woo'd!
    Sad wanton forwardness of Child for woes;
    Harsh rudiments, stern training which He chose!
    Now scantier wound for scanty body show,
    And scantier blood for scanty wound let now.
    Soon, when His strength and deeper draught of breath
    Shall furnish food luxuriously for Death,
    'Twill be His pleasure then full showers to try,
    Then will He strongly, wholly dare to die.
    No blood but what to cruel use will grow
    To Him belongs, or what He can bid flow.
    Ah, cruel Child, though of all things most mild,
    Yet to Thyself Thou canst be cruel, Child;
    To Thyself cruel, but most mild to me;
    A Lion mild, a pitiless Lamb here see.
    Long, long may this stern praise Thine honour lift,
    A faculty for woes[94] and innate gift.
    Fierce knife, from which experience sharp He borrows,
    While the Child hastes to grow the Man of Sorrows;
    Fierce knife, 'neath which Thou draw'st Thy golden breath,
    Advancing as 'twere 'neath the rod of Death.      R. WI.

    O ubi tam charo, tam casto in carcere regnet,

    Ille ut ab his fugiat, nec tam bona gaudia vellet?
      Ille ut in hos possit non properare sinus?
    Ille sui tam blanda sinus patrimonia spernet?

TO THE VIRGIN MARY,

ON LOSING THE CHILD JESUS.

    Not, not too much, Virgin, to plaints give way;
    Nor will, nor can, thy Son long from thee stay.
    Why should He? Where so love to be carest?
    What could prevent His nestling in thy breast?
    What lips more suited to those cheeks divine?
    What hand to clasp that neck more fit than thine?
    What could He hope more clinging than these arms?
    Or what embraces e'er possess such charms?
    What kindlier vine its tender elm around
    Could twine, in mutual folds e'en dying found?
    To whom with sudden arms more eager go?
    Who on this face such yearning glances throw?
    Where 'mid such quick-rain'd kisses could He wake?'
    Whence His prest cheek a nobler ruby take?
    Where could that grape ripen in airs more mild,
    Or hang 'neath hills where suns so sweetly smil'd?
    Where could such grateful languor o'er Him creep,
    Or what more soothing murmur lull to sleep?
    Where could He reign in nook so chaste, so dear,
    As in this Mother's, Virgin's bosom here?
    Could He fly hence, and such blest joys decline,
    And could He help hastening to breast of thine?
    This balmy bosom's heritage not share,
    Of such delights so easily made heir?
    Nay, Lady, nay; thy loud complainings stay;
    Be cheer'd: this is no Love that flies away.      R. WI.


APOCALYPSE XII. 7.

    Quas secum facies, imae mala pignora noctis;
      Quot secum nigros ducit in arma deos.
    Jam pugnas parat, heu saevus! jam pugnat, et ecce,

    His tamen ah nimium est quod frontibus addidit iras;
      Quod potuit rugas his posuisse genis.
    Hoc torvum decus est, tumidique ferocia fati,
      Quod magni sceleris mors quoque magna fuit.
    Quod neque, si victus, jaceat victoria vilis;
      Quod meruit multi fulminis esse labor;
    Quod queat ille suas hoc inter dicere flammas:
      'Arma tuli frustra: sed tamen arma tuli.'

WAR IN HEAVEN.

Rev. xii. 7.

    To arms, ye starry chieftains all, who lead
    The youth of heaven to war--to arms, with speed!
    Let each right-hand its untried arrows grasp,
    Or its own fiercely-gleaming falchion clasp.
    _He_ is _all_ here, and mightier in his wrath,
    The Dragon brings all powers the Dragon hath:
    Strange forms, curst children of the deepest Night--
    What dusky gods he marshals to the fight!
    Now he makes ready, fights now, fierce as hell!
    Scarce could I say 'He fights,' when, lo, he fell.
    Ah, 'twas too much to scar with wrath these faces,
    And leave on angel-cheeks such furrow'd traces.
    'Tis his grim boast and proudly-swelling fate,
    That of a great crime e'en the end was great:
    If vanquish'd, that 'twas no mean victory;
    Much bolted thunder there requir'd to be;
    That with these words his fiery pains he charms:
    'Arms I bore vainly; but I did bear arms.'        R. WI.

WE DO NOT RECEIVE, BUT MAKE, A SHORT LIFE.

    Dost thou lament that life, urg'd-on too quickly,
    Rolls round its course in hasting revolution?
    Dost blame the thrifty gods, when thou thyself art
                        Lavish of lifetime?
    What thyself wastest, mourn'st thou if it perish?
    Dost drive it from thee, but deplore it going?
    Is life thy servant? Sooth, a very servant
                        Turn'd off departeth.
    Life's stream is fleeting--I confess it--always;
    But once let Pleasure yield an easy incline,
    With headlong wave and with more fleeting current
                        Onward it glideth.
    Sleep, the thief, closing drowsy eyelids, snatcheth
    One mighty portion; while as large a portion
    Pleasure, the robber, carries off unchalleng'd--
                        Time's precious gold-dust.
    Thou for thyself a thousand deaths createst;
    And the more lifetimes thou dost spend in folly,
    So many more in lieu of them demandest;
                        Wasting and wanting.          R. WI.

MARTYRS.

    Good speed ye made, in sooth, good speed, ye blest,
    And by a shorter course won heavenly rest;
    Over a narrow sea of your own blood
    Death's bark has borne you, by few gales withstood:
    While with slow oars we toil the shore to gain,
    Through boisterous fury of the boundless main.
    _We_ waste with lingering, indolent decay;
    We are Death's pastime and his wanton play;
    O'er time and age and wide waves we are blown,
    Expos'd to furies and to chances thrown.
    Wretched in full are we, perish at length;
    Fates seek us out, and try on us their strength.
    We are Fate's skill, Evils' ambition fine,
    Death's utmost effort and deep-plann'd design.
    In a long life wide field for Death there lies;
    In a short life grand deeds may daze men's eyes.[96]
    By years we live we reckon not our life;
    Our life is short, with great deeds be it rife.
    To spend long years, let not long life be thought;
    A long-liv'd deed oft in short life is wrought.
    God not so much contracted your life's space,
    As order'd Death the sooner to give place.
    What earth's life loses, gains the life on high:
    By how much sooner, so much less we die.          R. WI.

ON STEPHEN'S CROWN.

    [This poem seems only intelligible by our supposing that a double
    reference is intended; first, and faintly, to St. Stephen the
    proto-martyr; and mainly to Stephens (Stephanus), father and son,
    Robert and Henry, the great scholars, commentators, printers, and
    publishers of the sixteenth century, whose books would always be in
    Crashaw's hands. Stephens, father and son, suffered persecution,
    banishment, poverty, and excommunication alike from Protestants and
    Catholics, while engaged in bringing out the Bible, Greek Testament,
    and numerous Classic Authors. 'In two years Henry revised and
    published more than 4000 pages of Greek text.' In the latter years
    of his life, being driven from Geneva (as it is alleged) by the
    'petty surveillance and censorship of the pious pastors there, he
    wandered in poverty over Europe, his own family often ignorant where
    he was to be found.']

    Behold thy stones! more precious nought is seen,
    Whether they deck with precious rays serene
    Thy head, or from it take a precious glow.
    This is your style of diadem; e'en so
    With crowned locks 'tis seemly ye should go:
    The viler in itself each stone may seem,
    A richer gem upon thy head will gleam.
    Behold the Book where, seen through mist of tears,
    A sacred form in manhood's bloom appears.
    Ah, you will say, when you behold this face,
    Such looks, O such, our father us'd to grace.
    The accustom'd sounds you hope for--holy thunder,
    And the blest honey hid that sweet tongue under:
    So, o'er his pen, you say, that hand was bent,
    When her own wings to fetter'd Fame he lent.
    Such was that breast, his spirit's lofty dwelling--
    That breast with its own starry thoughts high swelling.
    O pleasing fantasies of picture fair,
    And kindred forms which laboured brass may bear!
    Since through thee, Sire, such countless writings live,
    Life unto thee let this one writing give.         R. WI.

FROM 'STEPS TO THE TEMPLE' AND 'DELIGHTS OF THE MUSES,' ETC.

1646-1648.


NOTE.

    Among the English poems of the 'Steps to the Temple' and 'Delights
    of the Muses' of 1646 were the following, in order: In Picturam
    Reverendissimi Episcopi D. Andrews (p. 89)--Epitaphium in Dominum
    Herrisium (pp. 92-3)--Principi recens natae omen maternae indolis
    (pp. 108-9)--In Serenissimae Reginae partum hyemalem (pp. 118-9)--Ad
    Reginam (pp. 121-2)--In faciem Augustiss. Regis a morbillis integram
    (p. 127)--Rex Redux (pp. 131-2), and Ad Principem nondum natum (p.
    133). In the enlarged edition of 1648 besides these, there appeared:
    Bulla (pp. 54-58)--Thesaurus Malorum Foemina (p. 59)--In Apollinea
    depereuntem Daphnen (pp. 60-1)--Aeneas Patris sui Bajulus (p.
    61)--In Pygmaliona (p. 61)--Arion (pp. 61-2)--Phoenicis Genethliacon
    et Epicedion (p. 63)--Epitaphium (p. 64)--Damno affici saepe fit
    Lucrum (pp. 64-5)--Humanae Vitae Descriptio (p. 65)--Tranquillitas
    Animi, Similitudine ducta ab Ave captiva et canora tamen (pp. 66-7).

    These Poems I have arranged under two classes: (_a_) Miscellaneous,
    really, not merely formally, poetry: (_b_) Royal and other
    commemorative pieces. The former in the present section, the latter
    in the next. See our Essay on each. Nearly the whole of the
    translations in this division are by myself, with additional
    renderings of some by Rev. Thomas Ashe, M.A., as before, and others
    by Rev. Richard Wilton, M.A., as before, as pointed out in the
    places.

    As before, I note here the more misleading errors of Turnbull's
    text. In 'Bulla,' l. 1, 'timores' for 'tumores;' l. 4, 'dextera
    mihi' for 'dextra mei;' l. 54, 'nitent' for 'niteat;' l. 80, 'avis'
    for 'uvis;' l. 84, 'nives' for 'niveae;' l. 85, 'sint' for 'sunt;'
    l. 154, 'desinet' for 'defluet;' l. 157, 'Tempe' for 'Nempe:' in
    Tranquillitas Animi,' l. 13, 'minis minisque' for 'nimis nimisque;'
    l. 16, 'patrisque' for 'patreaeque;' l. 20, 'provocabit' for
    'provocabat:' in 'Humanae Vitae Descriptio,' l. 13, 'more' for
    'mare:' in 'Apollinea depereuntem Daphnen,' l. 12, 'ores' for
    'oris:' in Phoenicis Genethliacon et Epicedion,' l. 5, 'teipsum' for
    'teipsam:' in 'Epitaphium,' l. 6, 'tremulum' for 'tremulam;' l. 7,
    'discas' for 'disces,' 'hinc' for 'huc,' and 'reponas' for
    'repones;' l. 10, 'miseris' for 'nimis:' in 'Thesaurus Malorum
    Foemina,' l. 16, 'Pietas' for 'Pectus.' G.




BULLA.


    Quid tibi vana suos offert mea Bulla tumores?
      Quid facit ad vestrum pondus inane meum?
    Expectat nostros humeros toga fortior. Ista
      En mea Bulla, lares en tua dextra mei.
        Quid tu? quae nova machina,                             5
        Quae tam fortuito globo
        In vitam properas brevem?
        Qualis virgineos adhuc
        Cypris concutiens sinus,
        Cypris jam nova, jam recens,                           10
        Et spumis media in suis,
        Promsit purpureum latus;
        Concha de patria micas,
        Pulchroque exsilis impetu;
        Statim et millibus ebria                               15
        Ducens terga coloribus
        Evolvis tumidos sinus
        Sphaera plena volubili.
        Cujus per varium latus,
        Cujus per teretem globum                               20
        Iris lubrica cursitans
        Centum per species vagas,
        Et picti facies chori
        Circum regnat, et undique,
        Et se Diva volatilis                                   25
        Jucundo levis impetu
        Et vertigine perfida
        Lasciva sequitur fuga,
        Et pulchre dubitat; fluit
        Tam fallax toties novis,                               30
        Tot se per reduces vias,
        Erroresque reciprocos
        Spargit vena coloribus;
        Et pompa natat ebria.
        Tali militia micans                                    35
        Agmen se rude dividit;
        Campis quippe volantibus,
        Et campi levis aequore
        Ordo insanus obambulans
        Passim se fugit, et fugat.                             40
        Passim perdit, et invenit.
        Pulchrum spargitur hic Chaos.
        Hic viva, hic vaga flumina
        Ripa non propria meant,
        Sed miscent socias vias,                               45
        Communique sub alveo
        Stipant delicias suas.
        Quarum proximitas vaga
        Tam discrimine lubrico,
        Tam subtilibus arguit                                  50
        Juncturam tenuem notis,
        Pompa ut florida nullibi
        Sinceras habeat vias;
        Nec vultu niteat suo.
        Sed dulcis cumulus novos                               55
        Miscens purpureus sinus
        Flagrant divitiis suis,
        Privatum renuens jubar.
        Floris diluvio vagi,
        Floris sidere publico                                  60
        Late ver subit aureum,
        Atque effunditur in suae
        Vires undique copiae.
        Nempe omnis quia cernitur,
        Nullus cernitur hic color,                             65
        Et vicinia contumax
        Allidit species vagas.
        Illic contiguis aquis
        Marcent pallidulae faces.
        Unde hic vena tenellulae,                              70
        Flaminis ebria proximis
        Discit purpureas vias,
        Et rubro salit alveo.
        Ostri sanguineum jubar
        Lambunt lactea flumina;                                75
        Suasu caerulei maris
        Mansuescit seges aurea;
        Et lucis faciles genae
        Vanas ad nebulas stupent;
        Subque uvis rubicundulis                               80
        Flagrant sobria lilia;
        Vicinis adeo rosis
        Vicinae invigilant nives;
        Ut sint et niveae rosae,
        Ut sunt et roseae nives,                               85
        Accenduntque rosae nives,
        Extinguuntque nives rosas.
        Illic cum viridi rubet,
        Hic et cum rutile viret,
        Lascivi facies chori.                                  90
        Et quicquid rota lubrica
        Caudae stelligerae notat,
        Pulchrum pergit et in ambitum.
        Hic coeli implicitus labor,
        Orbes orbibus obvii;                                   95
        ex velleris aurei,
        Grex pellucidus aetheris;
        Qui noctis nigra pascua
        Puris morsibus atterit;
        Hic quicquid nitidum et vagum                         100
        Coeli vibrat arenula,
        Dulci pingitur in joco;
        Hic mundus tener impedit
        Sese amplexibus in suis.
        Succinctique sinu globi                               105
        Errat per proprium decus.
        Hic nictant subitae faces,
        Et ludunt tremulum diem,
        Mox se surripiunt sui et
        Quaerunt tecta supercili,                             110
        Atque abdunt petulans jubar,
        Subsiduntque proterviter.
        Atque haec omnia quam brevis
        Sunt mendacia machinae!
        Currunt scilicet omnia                                115
        Sphaera, non vitrea quidem--
        Ut quondam Siculus globus--
        Sed vitro nitida magis,
        Sed vitro fragili magis,
        Et vitro vitrea magis.                                120
          Sum venti ingenium breve,
        Flos sum, scilicet, aeris,
        Sidus scilicet aequoris;
        Naturae jocus aureus,
        Naturae vaga fabula,                                  125
        Naturae breve somnium.
        Nugarum decus et dolor;

        Tantum gutta superbior,
        Fortunatius et lutum.
          Sum fluxae pretium spei;
        Una ex Hesperidum insulis.

        Clare caecus ocellulus;

          Sum caecae speculum Deae,
        Sum Fortunae ego tessera,
        Quam dat militibus suis;                              140
        Sum Fortunae ego symbolum,
        Quo sancit fragilem fidem
        Cum mortalibus ebriis,
        Obsignatque tabellulas.
          Sum blandum, petulans, vagum,                       145
        Pulchrum, purpureum, et decens,
        Comptum, floridulum, et recens,
        Distinctum nivibus, rosis,
        Undis, ignibus, aere,
        Pictum, gemmeum, et aureum,                           150
        O sum, scilicet, o NIHIL.
    Si piget, et longam traxisse in taedia pompam

    Tolle tuos oculos pensum leve defluet, illam
      Parca metet facili non operosa manu.                    155
    Vixit adhuc. Cur vixit? adhuc tu nempe legebas.
      Nempe fuit tempus tum potuisse mori?


NOTE.

    A collation of the 'Bulla' with the Tanner MS. corrects the
    punctuation of the original and subsequent printed texts, and
    specially puts right in the last line 'Nempe' for 'Tempe,' so long
    retained. In the fourth line from close the printed texts read
    'desinet' for 'defluet.' Nothing else noticeable.     G.


TRANSLATION. THE BUBBLE. [TO REV. DR. LANY.]

    What art thou? What new device,
    Globe, chance-fashion'd in a trice,
    Into brief existence bounding,
    Perfectly thy circle rounding?
    As when Cypris, her breast smiting--
    Virgin still, all love inviting--
    Cypris in young loveliness
    Couch'd rosy where the white waves press
    Her to bear and her to bless;
    _So_ forth from thy native shell
    Gleamest thou ineffable!
    Springing up with graceful bound
    And describing dainty round;
    Thousand colours come and go
    As thou dost thy fair curves show,
    Swelling out--a whirling ball
    Meet for Fairy-Festival;
    Through whose sides of shifting hue,
    Through whose smooth-turn'd globe, we view
    Iris' gliding rainbow sitting,
    In a hundred forms soft-flitting:
    And semblance of a troop displaying,
    All around dominion swaying:
    And the Goddess volatile
    With witching step and luring smile
    Follows still with twinkling foot
    In link'd mazes involute:
    With many a sight-deceiving turn
    And flight which makes pursuers burn,
    And a graceful hesitation--
    Only treacherous simulation:
    JUST SO, and no less deceiving,
    Our BUBBLE, all its colours weaving,
    Follows ever-varying courses,
    Or in air itself disperses:
    Here now, there now, coming, going,
    Wand'ring as if ebbing, flowing:
    Sporting Passion's colours all
    In ways that are bacchanal;
    And the GLOBES undisciplin'd
    As though driven by the wind,
    Borne along the fleeting plains
    Light as air; nor order reigns--
    But the heaven-possess'd array
    Moving each in its own way,
    Hither now and thither flying,
    Glancing, wavering, and dying,
    Losing still their path and finding,
    In a random inter-winding:
    Rising, falling, on careering,
    Vis'ble now, now disappearing;
    Living wand'ring streams outgoing,
    Ev'n Confusion beauteous showing:
    Flowing not each in its course,
    But each to other joining force;
    Moving in pleasant pastime still
    In a mutual good-will:
    And a nearness that's so near
    You the contact almost fear,
    Yet so finely drawn to eye
    In its delicate subtlety
    That the procession, blossom-fair,
    Nowhere has direction clear:
    Nor with their own aspect glance,
    But in the sweet luxuriance
    Which skiey influences lend,
    As in new windings on they trend:
    Throwing off the stol'n sunlight
    In a flood of blossoms bright,
    Scatter'd on the fields of light;
    Such a brilliancy of bloom
    As all may share if all will come.
    Now golden Spring advances lightly,
    Spreading itself on all sides brightly,
    Out of its rich and full supply
    Open-handed, lavishly.
      Since all colours you discern,
    No one colour may you learn:
    All tints melted into one
    In a sweet confusion,
    You cannot tell 'tis that or this,
    So shifting is the loveliness:
    Gleams as of the peacock's crest,
    Or such as on dove's neck rest;
    Opal, edg'd with amethyst,
    Or the sunset's purpl'd mist,
    Or the splendour that there lies
    In a maiden's azure eyes,
    Kindling in a sweet surprise:
    Flower-tints, shell-tints, tender-dy'd,
    Save to curious unespied:
    Lo, one BUBBLE follows t'other,
    Differing still from its frail brother,
    Striking still from change to change
    With a quick and vivid range.
    There in the contiguous wave
    Torches palely-glist'ning lave;
    Here what delicate love-lights shine!
    Through them near flames bick'ring shine.
    Matching flushing of the rose,
    As the ruddy channel flows:
    Milky rivers in white tide
    Lucent, hush, still onwards glide:
    Purple rivers in high flood--
    Red as is man's awful blood:
    Corn-fields smiling goldenly
    Meet the blue laugh of the sea:
    Mist-clouds sailing on their way
    Darken the changeful cheeks of Day:
    And beneath vine-clusters red
    Lilies are transfigured:
    Here you mark as 'twere the snows
    Folding o'er the neighb'ring rose;
    Snow into blown roses flushing,
    Roses wearied of their blushing,
    As the shifting tints embrace,
    And their course you scarce can trace;
    Now retiring, now advancing,
    Now in wanton mazes dancing;
    Now a flow'ry red appears,
    Now a purpl'd green careers.
      All the signs in heaven that burn
    Where the gliding wheel doth turn,
    Here in radiant courses go,
    As though 'twere a heaven below:
    The sky's mazes involute
    Circling onward with deft foot,
    Sphere on heavenly sphere attending,
    Coming, going, inter-blending:
    And the gold-fleec'd flocks of air
    Wand'ring inviolate and fair;
    Flocks that drink in chaste delight
    Dewy pastures of the Night,
    Leaving no trace of foot or bite.
    Whate'er of change above you note,
    As these clouds o'er heaven float,
    Lo, repeated here we see
    In a sportive mimicry.
      Here the tiny tender world
    Within its own brightness furl'd
    Wavers, as in fairy robe
    'Twere a belted lined globe.
    Lights as of the breaking Day
    Tremble with iridescent play,
    But now swiftly upward going,
    Evanescent colours showing,
    In some nook their beams concealing,
    Nor their wantonness revealing.
    O, what store of wonders here
    In this short-liv'd slender SPHERE!
    For all wonders I have told
    Are within its GLOBE enroll'd:
    Not such globe as skilled he
    Fashion'd of old in Sicily:
    Brighter e'en than crystals are,
    And than crystal frailer far.
      'I am Spirit of the Wind,
    For a flitting breath design'd;
    I am Blossom born of air;
    I'm of Ocean, guiding Star;
    I'm a golden sport of Nature,
    Frolic stamp'd on ev'ry feature:
    I'm a myth, an idle theme,
    The brief substance of a dream:
    Grace and grief of trifles, I
    Charm--a well-skill'd vanity;
    Begotten of the treacherous breeze,
    Parent of absurdities:
    Yet, a drop or mote, at best,
    Favour'd more than are the rest.
    I'm price of Hope that no more is,
    One of the Hesperides:
    Beauty's casket, doating eye
    Of lovers blinded wilfully:
    The light Spirit of Vanity.
    I am Fortune's looking-glass,
    The countersign which she doth pass
    To her troop of warriors:
    I'm the oath by which she swears,
    And wherewith she doth induce
    Men to trust a fragile truce.
    Charming, provoking, still astray,
    Fair and elegant and gay,
    Trim and fresh and blossom-hu'd;
    Interchangeably imbu'd
    With rosy-red and the snow's whiteness,
    Air and water and fire's brightness:
    Painted, gemm'd, of golden dye,
    NOTHING--after all--am I!'
    If now, O gentle Reader, it appear
      Irksome my BUBBLE'S chatterings to hear;
    If on it frowning, 'Words, words, words!' thou say,
      No more I'll chatter, but at once obey.
    So, turn thine eye, my Friend, no more give heed;
      My BUBBLE lives but if thou choose to read.
    Cease thou to read, and I resign my breath;
      Cease thou to read, and that will be my death.      G.


TRANQUILLITAS ANIMI:

SIMILITUDINE DUCTA AB AVE CAPTIVA, ET CANORA TAMEN.

    Ut cum delicias leves, loquacem
    Convivam nemoris vagamque musam
    Observans, dubia viator arte
    Prendit desuper: horridusve ruris
    Eversor, male perfido paratu,                               5
    Heu durus! rapit, atque io triumphans
    Vadit: protinus et sagace nisu
    Evolvens digitos, opus tenellum
    Ducens pollice lenis erudito,
    Virgarum implicat ordinem severum,                         10
    Angustam meditans domum volucri.
    Illa autem, hospitium licet vetustum
    Mentem solicitet nimis nimisque,
    Et suetum nemus, hinc opaca mitis
    Umbrae frigora, et hinc aprica puri                        15
    Solis fulgura, patriaeque sylvae
    Nunquam muta quies; ubi illa dudum
    Totum per nemus, arborem per omnem,
    Hospes libera liberis querelis
    Cognatum bene provocabat agmen:                            20
    Quanquam ipsum nemus arboresque alumnam
    Implorant profugam, atque amata multum
    Quaerant murmura lubricumque carmen
    Blandi gutturis et melos serenum.
    Illa autem, tamen, illa jam relictae,                      25
    Simplex! haud meminit domus, nec ultra
    Sylvas cogitat; at brevi sub antro,
    Ah penna nimium brevis recisa,
    Ah ritu vidua sibique sola,
    Privata heu fidicen! canit, vagoque                        30
    Exercens querulam domum susurro
    Fallit vincula, carceremque mulcet;
    Nec pugnans placidae procax quieti
    Luctatur gravis, orbe sed reducto
    Discursu vaga saltitans tenello,                           35
    Metitur spatia invidae cavernae.
    Sic in se pia mens reposta, secum
    Alte tuta sedet, nec ardet extra,
    Aut ullo solet aestuare fato:
    Quamvis cuncta tumultuentur, atrae                         40
    Sortis turbine non movetur illa.
    Fortunae furias onusque triste
    Non tergo minus accipit quieto,
    Quam vectrix Veneris columba blando
    Admittat juga delicata collo.                              45
    Torvae si quid inhorruit procellae,
    Si quid saeviat et minetur, illa
    Spernit, nescit, et obviis furorem
    Fallit blanditiis, amatque et ambit
    Ipsum, quo male vulneratur, ictum.                         50
    Curas murmure non fatetur ullo;
    Non lambit lacrymas dolor, nec atrae
    Mentis nubila frons iniqua prodit.
    Quod si lacryma pervicax rebelli
    Erumpit tamen evolatque gutta,                             55
    Invitis lacrymis, negante luctu,
    Ludunt perspicui per ora risus.


TRANSLATION. PEACE OF MIND:[98]

UNDER THE SIMILITUDE OF A CAPTIVE SONG-BIRD.

    The time of the singing of birds is come;
    I will away i' the greenwood to roam;
    I will away; and thou azure-ey'd Muse
    Deign with thy gifts my mind to suffuse.--
      So o'erheard I one say, as he withdrew
    To a fairy scene that well I knew,
    Light lac'd with shadow, shadow with light,
    Leaves playing bo-peep from morn unto night.
      But, ah, what is this? Alas, and alas,
    A sweet bird flutters upon the grass;
    Flutters and struggles with quivering wing!
    Tempted and snar'd--gentle, guileless thing.
    Vain, vain thy struggles; for, lo, a hand
    Hollow'd above, makes thee captive stand.
      Home hies the Captor, loud singing his joy;
    He has got a pet song-bird for his boy.
    Now twining and twisting, a cage he makes
    Wire-wrought and fast'n'd. Ah, my heart aches!
    It is a prison, for the poor bird prepar'd;
    Shut close and netted, netted and barr'd.
      Comes the flutter and gleam of forest-leaves
    Through the trellis'd window under the eaves;
    Comes the breath and stir of the vernal wind,
    Comes the goldening sunshine--to remind
    Of all that is lost; comes now and again
    Far off a song from the blading grain;
    Calling, still calling the Songster to come
    Back--once more back--to its woodland home.
      I mark eyelids rise; mark the lifting wing;
    Mark the swelling throat, as if it would sing;
    Mark the weary 'chirp, chirp,' like infant's cry,
    Yearning after the free and boundless sky;
    For the grand old woods; once more to sit
    On the swinging bough into blossom smit.
      Vain, vain, poor bird! thou'rt captive still;
    Thou must bend thee to thy Captor's will:
    Thy wing is cut; from thy mate thou'rt taken;
    All alone thou abidest, sad, forsaken.
      The days pass on; and I look in once more
    On the captive bird 'bove the ivied door.
    Sweetly it sings, as if all by itself,
    A short, quiet song. O thou silly elf,
    Hast forgot the greenwood, the forest hoar,
    The flash of the sky, the wind's soften'd roar?
    Hast forgot that thou still a captive art,
    Prison'd in wire-work? hast forgot thy smart?
      'Tis even so: for now down, and now up,
    Now hopping on perch, now sipping from cup,
    I mark it sullen and pining no more,
    But keeping within, though open the door.
    List ye, now list--from its swelling throat,
    Of its woodland song you miss never a note.
    Alone, it is true, and in a wir'd cage;
    But kindness has melted the captive's rage.
      Behold a sweet meaning in this bird's story--
    How the child of God is ripen'd for glory:
    For it is thus with the child of God,
    Smitten and bleeding 'neath His rod:
    Thus 'tis with him; for, tranquil and calm
    'Mid dangers and insults, he singeth his psalm:
    Alone, all alone, deserted of man,
    Slander'd and trampl'd and plac'd under ban,
    He frets not, he pines not, he plains not still,
    But sees clear in all his dear Father's will:
    Come loss, come cross, come bereavement, come wrong,
    He sets all to music, turns all to song;
    Come terror, come trial, come dark day, come bright,
    Still upward he looks, and knows all is right:
    Wounded, he sees the Hand gives the stroke,
    Bending his neck to bear his Lord's yoke,
    And finds it grow light, by grace from Above,
    As love's slender collars o' the Queen of Love;
    Comes the starting tear, 'tis dried with a smile;
    Comes a cloud, as you look 'tis gone the while;
    Stirs the 'old Adam' to tempt and to dare,
    He thinks Who was tempted and knows what we are;
    Gentle and meek, murmurs not nor rebels,
    But serene as in heaven and tranquil dwells:
    And so the Believer has 'songs in the night,'
    And so every cloud has a lining of light.
      Thus, even thus, the captive bird's story
      Tells how a soul is ripen'd for glory.              G.

GAIN OUT OF LOSS.

    Losses are often source of secret gain,
    Delays good-speed, and ease the child of pain.
    The subtle snake, laying aside her fears,
    Casts off her slough, and heals the waste of years.
    The phoenix thus her waning pride supplies,
    And, to be ever-living, often dies;
    Bold for her good, she makes the fires her friend,
    And to begin anew, will plot her end.
    What skilful losing! what wise use of dying!
    What trust in flames! and what a craft in plying
    That trick of immolation! Canst thou so
    Compound with griefs? canst wisely undergo
    Life's losses, crosses? play with gainful doom?
    Canst, to be quicken'd, gladly seek the tomb?
    Thrice-happy he thus touch'd with healing sorrow,
    For whom night's strife plots but a gracious morrow.  A.

ANOTHER RENDERING (_more freely_).

    Suff'ring is not always loss;
    Often underneath the cross--
    Heavy, crushing, wearing, slow,
    Causing us in dread to go--
    All unsuspected lieth gain,
    Like sunshine in vernal rain.
      Lo, the serpent's mottled skin
    Cast, new lease of years doth win:
    Lo, the phoenix in the fire
    Leaps immortal from its pyre,
    The mystic plumage mewing,
    And life by death renewing.
    What a wise loss thus to lose!--
    Who will gainsay or abuse?
    What strange end to fun'ral pile,
    Thus in Death's gaunt face to smile!
    Faith still strong within the fire,
    Faith triumphant o'er its ire.
      How stands it, fellow-man, with thee?
    What meaning in this myth dost see?
    Happy thou, if when thou'rt lying
    On thy sick-bed slow a-dying,
    Cometh vision of the Eternal,
    Cometh strength for the supernal,
    Cometh triumph o'er the infernal;
    And thou canst the Last Enemy
    Calmly meet, serenely die;
    The hard Sisters life's web snipping,
    But thy spirit never gripping;
    Good, not evil, to thee bringing;
    Hushing not thy upward singing,
    To the Golden City winging.
      Even so to die is gain,
    Like the Harvest's tawnied grain:
    Suffering is not always loss;
    The Crown succeeds the Cross.                         G.


HUMANAE VITAE DESCRIPTIO.

    O vita, tantum lubricus quidam furor
    Spoliumque vitae! scilicet longi brevis
    Erroris hospes! Error o mortalium!
    O certus error! qui sub incerto vagum
    Suspendit aevum, mille per dolos viae                       5
    Fugacis, et proterva per volumina
    Fluidi laboris, ebrios lactat gradus;
    Et irretitos ducit in nihilum dies.
    O fata! quantum perfidae vitae fugit
    Umbris quod imputemus atque auris, ibi                     10
    Et umbra et aura serias partes agunt
    Miscentque scenam, volvimur ludibrio
    Procacis aestus, ut per incertum mare
    Fragilis protervo cymba cum nutat freto;
    Et ipsa vitae fila, queis nentes Deae                      15
    Aevi severa texta producunt manu,
    Haec ipsa nobis implicant vestigia,
    Retrahunt trahuntque, donec everso gradu
    Ruina lassos alta deducat pedes.
    Felix, fugaces quisquis excipiens dies                     20
    Gressus serenos fixit, insidiis sui
    Nec servit aevi, vita inoffensis huic
    Feretur auris, atque clauda rarius
    Titubabit hora: vortices anni vagi
    Hic extricabit, sanus assertor sui.                        25


TRANSLATION.

DESCRIPTION OF HUMAN LIFE.

    O Life, or but some evanescent madness
    And glittering spoil of life snatch'd with blind gladness!
    Of endless Error, transitory guest;
    Sad human Error, which would fain find rest.
    O certain Error, 'neath uncertain sky
    Suspending here our frail mortality;
    Leading us through a thousand devious ways
    And intricacies of a treacherous maze!
    Our staggering footsteps how dost thou beguile
    Through wanton rounds of unavailing toil,
    And our entangl'd days to nothing bring!
    O fates, how much of our poor life takes wing,
    Wasted on winds and shadows! On life's stage
    Shadows and winds a serious part engage,
    The scene confusing. On life's billow tost,
    The sport of changeful tide, we're well-nigh lost,
    And, like a frail boat on a stormy sea,
    We waver up and down uncertainly.
    Nay, e'en the threads spun by the Fates on high,
    As with stern fingers they divinely ply
    The web of life, twine round us as we go,
    And draw us backwards, forwards, to and fro;
    Till Ruin trips us up, and we are found
    Helpless and weary, stretched along the ground.
      Happy the man who, welcoming each day
    With smiles that answer to its fleeting ray,
    Pursues with step serene his purpos'd way;
    The alluring snares peculiar to the age
    _His_ soul enslave not, nor his mind engage;
    His life with peaceful tenor glides along,
    By fav'ring breezes fann'd, and sooth'd with song;
    Inspir'd by Heaven with soul-sustaining force,
    Seldom he falls, or falters in his course;
    But ever, as the eddying years roll round,
    Bursting through all the perils that abound,
    A wise assertor of himself is found.              R. WI.


IN PYGMALIONA.

              Poenitet artis
              Pygmaliona suae,
    Quod felix opus esset,
    Infelix erat artifex;
    Sentit vulnera, nec videt ictum.
    Quis credit? gelido veniunt de marmore flammae:
    Marmor ingratum nimis
    Incendit autorem suum.
    Concepit hic vanos furores,
    Opus suum miratur atque adorat.
    Prius creavit, ecce nunc colit manus;
    Tentantes digitos molliter applicat;
    Decipit molles caro dura tactus.
    An virgo vera est, an sit eburnea;
    Reddat an oscula quae dabantur,
    Nescit; sed dubitat, sed metuit, munere supplicat,
    Blanditiasque miscet.
    Te, miser, poenas dare vult, hos Venus, hos triumphos
    Capit a te, quod amorem fugis omnem.
    Cur fugis heu vivos? mortua te necat puella.
    Non erit innocua haec, quamvis tua fingas manu;
    Ipsa heu nocens erit nimis, cujus imago nocet.

ON PYGMALION.

      Grief for work his hands have done
      Harroweth Pygmalion;
      Happy reach of art! yet he
      The artificer, unhappily,
    He feels the wounds: what deals the blow?
    Can it be true? can flames from gelid marble flow?

      Marble, treacherous and to blame
      To burn your Sculptor with such flame!
      What madness in his heart is hid?
    He wonders at, he adores the work he did.
      First he made, and next his hand
      With wandering fingers softly tries
      The mystery to understand.
      Ah, surely now the hard flesh lies!
    Is it a living maiden, see!
      O treacherous blisses!
    Is it no marble? can it frail flesh be?
      Does it return his kisses?
    He knows not, he.

      He doubts, he fears, he prays; what mean
    All these sweet blandishments between?
    Venus, wretched Sculptor, wills
    You should suffer these sad ills;
    This is her triumph over you,
      Because at love your lips would curl;
    Your will not living overthrows yet this dead girl.

    Weep, ah, weep, Pygmalion!
      Though you shap'd her with your hands,
    With your chisel, out of stone,
      Not innocuous here she stands.
      O image of a maiden!
    If you so strangely baneful prove,
      With what despair will you come laden,
    Coming alive to claim his love!                       A.

ANOTHER VERSION (_more freely_).

    Pygmalion mourns his own success;
    Was ever such strange wretchedness?
    His work itself, a work of Art,
    Perfect in its every part;
    But himself? Alas, artist he
    Of his own utmost misery.
    He feels his wounds, but who shall tell
    Whence come the drops that downward steal?
    Flames leap out from the marble, cold
    As ice itself by storm-wind roll'd:
    And he, contriver of that fire,
    Burns self-immolate on his own pyre;
    Furies of his own genius born
    Cast him, adoring and forlorn,
    Into a strange captivity
    Before his own hands' work; and he
    Clings to the shapely form, until,
    In ecstasy of love a-thrill,
    He burning lips to cold lips sets,
    And wild with passion her cheek wets;
    Strains to his breast insensate stone,
    As 'twere a breathing thing; with moan,
    With clasp and grasp and tingling touch,
    As though he ne'er could grip too much;
    And wilder'd cry of agony,
    That she respond would; by him lie
    A virgin pure as drifted snow,
    Or lilies that i' the meadows blow.
    Is it ivory? is it stone?
    Lives it? or is it clay alone?
    O that to flesh the stone would melt,
    And show a soul within it dwelt!
      He looks, he yearns, he sighs, he sobs,
    Convulsive his whole body throbs;
    He doubts, he fears, he supplicates
    With wistful gaze; he on her waits;
    Gifts lavish he lays at her feet,
    And, stung to passion, will entreat,
    As though the image he has made
    Were thing of life he might persuade--
    Persuade and woo, and on her stake
    His future, all. O sad mistake!
    For thee, Pygmalion, Venus sends
    These triumphs which thy chisel lends,
    To punish thee, for that no love
    Erewhile thy obstinate heart might move.
      Why flee'st thou the living, say,
    When this image thee doth slay?
    Thee doth--ay, slay! Why dost thou stand
    Entranc'd before the work o' thy hand,
    None the less hurtful that it is
    Thine own genius yields the bliss?
    Venus must thee still deny;
    The sculptured maid must breathless lie.              G.


ARION.

    Squammea vivae
    Lubrica terga ratis

    Perdidere illum viri
    Mercede magna, servat hic

    Minoris et servatur hinc quam perditur.
    Hic dum findit aquas, findit hic aera:

    Carminis hoc placido Tridente
    Abjurat sua jam murmura, ventusque modestior
    Auribus ora mutat:

    Ambit et ora viri, nec vela ventis hic egent;
    Attendit hanc ventus ratem: non trahit, at trahitur.

ARION.

    Never since ship was set a-float
    Have men seen so strange a boat:
    Alive it is from deck to keel,
    Having the gray gleam of steel;
    Slippery as wave-wash'd wreck,
    Or as a war-ship's bloody deck.
    A Dolphin, lo, its huge back bending,
    Safety to Arion lending
    From the sailors of Sicily,
    Covetous of his golden monie;
    Money that as prize he had won
    Before all Singers aneath the sun;
    Playing and singing so famouslie,
    Singing and playing so wondrouslie,
    That there went up from ev'ry throat
    The verdict, 'for Arion I vote:'
    Vote the prize; and gifts as well,
    Crowns of gold and of asphodel;
    Lyres all a-glow with gems,
    Robes bejewell'd to their hems;
    A thousand golden pieces and one
    For the gifted son of Poseidon:
    And, hark, as 'twere the bellowing thunder,
    In clang'rous shouts men tell their wonder.
      Arion now homeward takes his way
    In a fair ship steer'd for Corinth Bay;
    Proud of his prizes, proud of his skill,
    Proud that soon Periander will
    Welcome him fondly, and call him friend,
    With words such as no money can send.
      Alas and alas, such crime to tell!
    The ship-captain and sailors fell
    Covet his gold, and have it must,
    Though Arion they murder by blow or thrust.
      But Apollo at midnight hour
    Sendeth a dream in mystic power;
    It showeth the men, it showeth their crime.
    Arion awakes with the morning's chime;
    Awakes, and planneth how to escape.
    Vain, vain all; on him they gape,
    Thirsting alike for gold and life,
    Murder and covetousness at strife.
      'Suffer me, then,' Arion said,
    'That I may play as I have play'd;
    Here is my poor Lyre, and, ere I die,
    Let me prove its minstrelsy.'
      He has donn'd him now in gay attire,
    Festal robes; in his hand his Lyre.
    List ye, list ye; above, below,
    Sounds such as only the angels know;
    Sounds that are born of rapture and bliss,
    Of the throbbing heart and the burning love-kiss.
    Now it is soft, pathetic, low,
    Then 'gins to change to cry of woe;
    Now it comes rushing as if the thunder
    Came booming from the deep earth under;
    Pulsing along each quivering string
    As though the Lyre were a living thing,
    And Arion's hand had so cunning a spell
    As should win all heaven--ay and hell.
    O, came there never such melodie
    From mortal earth or mortal sky.
    He mounted to the good ship's prow,
    And mingling with his song a vow
    To the gods, he himself threw
    Out 'mid the waves from that damnable crew.
      Up through the waves the Dolphins bound,
    A hundred bended backs are found,
    Each one more eager than the rest
    To upbear the sweet Player on Ocean's breast.
      Arion ascends; and, lo, he stands,
    His Lyre unwet within his hands:
    Onward and onward careering they go;
    O soft and true the notes that flow!
    Rising, falling, swelling, dying,
    Near and nearer, far-off flying;
    Pulsing along each quivering string
    As though the Lyre were a living thing.
      New is the ship, as new the freight;
    The Dolphin feels never the weight;
    New is the ship, and new the fare,
    That of the water, this of the air:
    The sailors in their greed him lost,
    The Dolphin bears him withouten cost.
      Away and away with a shim'ring track
    Arion goes on the Dolphin's back;
    Away and away, still softly playing,
    Each string his lightest touch obeying.
    Under the spell the Sea grows calm,
    Listing attent his witching psalm;
    Under the spell the air grows mild,
    Breathing soft as sleeping child.
        But who may seek all the tale to tell?
        It is a tale unspeakable.
      Onward and onward careering they go,
    Silence above and silence below:
    The Storm-gale shuts its mouth and lists,
    The Wind folds its pinions and desists,
    Following, not blowing, drawing not, but drawn,
    From early ev'ning to breaking dawn.
    Tenarus at last Arion beheld;
    Tenarus, his own dear home that held;
    And as together they swiftly come,
    He claps hands loud and thinks of home.
      The Dolphin seeks a quiet cove;
    The Dolphin arching its back above
    The azure waters, leaves him there,
    A-list'ning still his Lyre to hear.
      Homeward to Corinth Arion proceeds:
    Periander a tale of suff'ring reads
    In the thinned cheek and the dreamy eye,
    In the tremulous words and the laden sigh.
      The story is told. O story of wrong!
    The ship returns; and it is not long
    Ere captain and crew, at bar arraign'd,
    Must tell where Arion they detain'd.
    'He tarries,' quoth they, 'in Sicily,
    Winning all men by his minstrelsie.'
      Lies were proven in their throat.
    Periander his hands together smote,
    Swearing a solemn oath that they--
    One, all--should drown'd be in the Bay.
      Tied hand and foot, pallor'd and grim,
    'Tis done as they would ha' done to him.
    A plunge as of a plunging stone,

APOLLINEA DEPEREUNTEM DAPHNEN.


    Stulte Cupido,
    Quid tua flamma parat?
    Annos sole sub ipso
    Accensae pereunt faces?
    Sed fax nostra potentior istis,
    Flammas inflammare potest, ipse uritur ignis,
    Ecce flammarum potens
    Majore sub flamma gemit.
    Eheu, quid hoc est? En Apollo
    Lyra tacente, ni sonet dolores,
    Coma jacente squallet aeternus decor
    Oris, en, dominae quo placeat magis,
    Languido tardum jubar igne promit.
    Pallente vultu territat aethera.
    Mundi oculus lacrymis senescit,
    Et solvit pelago debita, quodque hauserat ignibus,
    His lacrymis rependit.
    Noctis adventu properans se latebris recondit,
    Et opacas tenebrarum colit umbras,
    Namque suos odit damnans radios nocensque lumen.
    An lateat tenebris dubitat, an educat diem,
    Hinc suadet hoc luctus furens, inde repugnat amor.

ON APOLLO PINING FOR DAPHNE.

    Cupid, foolishest of pets,
    What woe thy swift-sent flame begets!
    Surely before the flashing Sun
    Torches pale to extinction?
    But our torch is mightier far;
    It able is 'gainst fire to war,
    Yea, fire itself to burn and char.
      The igni-potent in amaze,
    Lo, groans, his huge heart all a-blaze
    With keener flame than his own rays.
      Ah, what is this? Apollo burns,
    And as distraught in anguish mourns.
    Lo, see his lyre mute and unstrung,
    Or only grief-notes from it wrung:
    Lo, his golden locks neglected,
    And his radiant face dejected;
    Beauty eterne distain'd, rejected.
      The great Sun-god is in love,
    And seeks in vain his Fair to move:
    Hence his weird pallor, and those cries
    That the sky shudd'ring terrifies;
    Hence the world's day-bringing eye
    Tears dim, such as in mortals' lie;
    Hence those showers often falling,
    The Sea her erst gifts recalling;
    Hence welcome the approaching night,
    That mourning he may veil his light--
    Veil his light, and in shadows deep
    His great anguish in secret weep.
    Nor, when vermeil-draped Morning,
    With her smile the East adorning,
    Touches with her rosy finger
    Eyes that 'neath their lashes linger,
    Seeking to wake the God of Day,
    That round the world his beams may play,
    Does he haste at all to rise
    To his 'fulgent throne i' the skies;
    But rather would abide within
    The clouds whereon he rests his chin;
    Hating his own beams' splendour now,
    Since Daphne scorns to list his vow:
    Thus he lingers, and still weighs
    Whether Day or Night to raise.
    Raging grief he cannot smother,
    Says the one; and Love the other.
    Cupid, tricksiest of pets,
    What woe thy swift-sent flame begets![99]             G.




AENEAS PATRIS SUI BAJULUS.


    Moenia Trojae, hostis et ignis,
    Hostes inter et ignes, Aeneas spolium pium
    Atque humeris venerabile pondus
    Excipit, et 'Saevae nunc o nunc parcite flammae;
    Parcite haud, clamat, mihi;
    Sacrae favete sarcinae:
    Quod si negatis, nec licebit
    Vitam juvare, sed juvabo funus
    Rogusque fiam patris ac bustum mei.'
    His dictis, acies pervolat hostium,
    Gestit, et partis veluti trophaeis
    Ducit triumphos. Nam furor hostium
    Jam stupet, et pietate tanta
    Victor vincitur; imo et moritur
    Troja libenter, funeribusque gaudet,
    Ac faces admittit ovans, ne lateat tenebras
    Per opacas opus ingens pietatis.
    Debita sic patri solvis tua, sic pari rependis
    Officio. Dederat vitam tibi, tu reddis huic:
    Felix, parentis qui pater diceris esse tui.

AENEAS THE BEARER OF HIS FATHER.

    The walls of Troy--the walls of Troy!
    'Tis an old tale you will enjoy:
    A foe is there amid the fire,
    A foe 'twixt foemen in their ire.
      Aeneas takes a pious load
    With upward prayer to his god;
    E'en his old father, whose gray head
    Lay 'mong the dying and the dead:
    O venerable spoil in truth,
    Fit from the demons to fetch ruth.
      Fierce roar the flames, and fiercer still
    Rages the fight on plain and hill.
    'Spare the old man,' Aeneas cries;
    'Spare the white hairs; or if he dies,
    Be mine the privilege of his pyre;
    Be mine with him at once t'expire.'
      Scarcely are the true words spoken,
    When through line of battle broken
    Swift he passes; and this brave son
    His father bears in triumph on;
    Reck'ning that he a trophy has
    That the conquerors' doth surpass.
      He safely goes: for, lo, amaz'd,
    The foe upon them wistful gaz'd:
    The conquerors the conquer'd are
    By filial love so strong, so fair.
    The flames Troy willingly receives,
    Jubilant that the old man lives;
    Welcomes the torches, that the night
    May not conceal this deed of light.
      All praise to thee, high-hearted son!
    Thou an undying name hast won:
    The debt of love thou hast repaid
    Unto thy father, who is made
    Thy debtor now; for life he gave,
    And thou in turn his life dost save.
    Happy the son whom thus we see
    Father of his own sire to be.                  G.


PHOENICIS GENETHLIACON ET EPICEDION.

    Phoenix alumna mortis,
    Quam mira tua puerpera!
    Tu scandis haud nidos, sed ignes.
    Non parere sed perire ceu parata:
    Mors obstetrix; atque ipsa tu teipsam paris,
          Tu tuique mater ipsa es,
          Tu tuique filia.
    Tu sic odora messis
    Surgis tuorum funerum;
    Tibique per tuam ruinam
    Reparata, te succedis ipsa. Mors o
    Faecunda; sancta o lucra pretiosae necis!
          Vive, monstrum dulce, vive,
          Tu tibique suffice.

OF THE GENERATION AND REGENERATION OF THE PHOENIX.

    Phoenix, nursling of Death,
      How wondrous is thy birth!
    Thou gainest not thy breath
      I' nest, like birds of Earth:
    'Mid fire all flaming hot
    Thou strangely art begot;
    The leaping flames thee cherish
    When thou seem'st to perish.
      Lo, Death thy midwife is;
      Lo, thyself thou bearest.
    O tell me how is this,
      That mystery thou preparest?
    Thou mother of thyself!
    Thou daughter of thyself!
    When thy 'pointed hour is done,
      Thou an od'rous nest entwinest;
    And, as for thy destruction,
    Thou 'midst its fires reclinest.
      Most surely thou'rt consum'd;
      Most surely thou'rt relum'd.
    O fruitful Death!
    O gainful Death!
    Live then, self-contained bird;
      Most pleasing wonder.
    The old legend is absurd;
      But truth lies under.                               G.

EPITAPH.

    Ye that still, serene in peace,
    Lying in the lap of ease,
    Believe the hopes of golden youth,
    And have not heard the bitter truth,
    How shining suns fade at a breath;
    Ye, with little dread of death,
    Or fear of chains and iron night
    Of man's last prison, or the sight
    Of gloomy Dis; that think to keep
    Old age away,--look here, and weep.
    Here, to this one narrow room,
    A thousand joys and hopes have come;
    Here bright minutes many a one
    Have a lasting night put on:
    Youth's torch, that flash'd such light about,
    Is in the Stygian wave put out.
    Then, if you grudge poor grief a tear,
    Heave, at least, a sigh for fear.                     A.

ANOTHER RENDERING (_more freely_).

    Whoe'er ye be, upgazing here,
    Calm, unruffl'd, without tear;
    Joyous in your golden prime,
    And unwitting of the time
    When shall pale Life's glowing sun,
    And the web of years be spun;
    Thinking not o' the iron night
    Where grim Pluto reigns in might;
    Thinking not of the nether world,
          With its clanking chains;
    Whither damned souls are hurl'd
          When the Judge arraigns;
        Seeing old age far away;
    Making Life one holiday;--
    Here perceive that Grief shall yet
    Your ruddy cheeks with sorrow wet;
    Here musing upon this poor stone,
    Ye may learn prevention.
    This Earth, what is it but a home
    Fugitive as sea-wave's foam?
    Mark where breaks the whit'n'd wave
    'Mid the cliffs--an arched cave;
    Light and shadow play within,
          Flick'ring o'er its walls;
    In the gloom--with Hell akin--
          A dull stream slowly crawls.
        E'en such is Life, how bright soe'er,
    Hope and Joy lure to Despair;
    And Life's stream goes plunging down
    Into dark drear Acheron;
    Youth's bright torch extinguish'd quite;
    Golden Day exchang'd for Night:
    To long night of changeless woe
    Swift the Christless souls shall go.
    Shun not therefore in thy prime,
    Shun not whilst thou art in Time,
    Tears of penitence over sin;
      Or bitterly shalt thou rue,
    When Death shall fling his javelin,
      And Hell's prison thee immew.
    Bethink thee in thy golden prime;
    Bethink thee whilst thou'rt yet in Time.              G.


ELEGIA.[100]

    Ite, meae lacrymae, nec enim moror, ite; sed oro
      Tantum ne miserae claudite vocis iter.
    O liceat querulos verbis animare dolores,
      Et saltem 'Ah periit!' dicere noster amor.
    Ecce negant tamen; ecce negant, lacrymaeque rebelles
      Pergunt indomita praecipitantque via.
    Visne, o care, igitur te nostra silentia dicant?
      Vis fleat assiduo murmure mutus amor?
    Flebit, et urna suos semper bibet humida rores,

ELEGY.

    Flow, flow, my tears; I stay you not; but pray
    To my unhappy voice close not the way.
    My plaintive griefs with words, O let me move;
    To say, 'Alas, he died!' allow my love.
    Lo, they say, no--the rebel tears say, no!
    And with unconquer'd headlong torrent flow.
    Wouldst thou, O dear one, that our silence speak?
    Mute love with ceaseless sob moisten our cheek?
    It shall; and still thine urn drink its own dews,
    And never its own faithful waters lose.
    Meanwhile let no one think a wonder wrought,
    If real tears to speak could not be taught.       R. WI.


THESAURUS MALORUM FOEMINA.

    Quis deus, o quis erat, qui te, mala foemina, finxit?

    Quae divum manus est adeo non dextera mundo?
      In nostras clades ingeniosa manus:
    Parcite; peccavi: nec enim pia numina possunt
      Tam crudele semel vel voluisse nefas.
    Vestrum opus est pietas; opus est concordia vestrum;
      Vos equidem tales haud reor artifices.
    Heus, inferna cohors, foetus cognoscite vestros.
      Num pudet hanc vestrum vincere posse scelus?
    Plaudite Tartarei proceres Erebique potentes,
      Nae mirum est tantum vos potuisse malum;
    Jam vestras laudate manus. Si forte tacetis,
      Artificum laudes grande loquetur opus.
    Quam bene vos omnes speculo contemplor in isto?
      Pectus in angustum cogitur omne malum.
    Quin dormi, Pluto; rabidas compesce sorores;
      Jam non poscit opem nostra ruina tuam.
    Haec satis in nostros fabricata est machina muros,
      Mortales furias Tartara nostra dabunt.

WOMAN A TREASURY OF EVILS.

    What god? or who was it? I ask, contriv'd
    Thee, O Woman, evil Woman? who conniv'd
    Together--who--in this supremest crime
    Of the divinities, before old Time
    Was born? Alas, most dire calamity
    As e'er has come upon humanity!
    Whence was the hand, ye Powers, so evil-skill'd
    In sin and mischief, so perversely will'd
    To curse this world of ours? But hold! I blunder;
    I must to the dark regions lying under,
    Ev'n Hell, descend. Not Thee, O God above,
    For Thou art pitiful, for Thou art Love:
    Not one of all the gracious Pow'rs supernal;
    But ye, O Furies, from the pit infernal,
    Ye, ye the work devis'd, matur'd, achiev'd,
    And brought to Man; to Man--frail Man! deceiv'd:
    Ho, hosts of evil! ho! on you I call:
    Behold your offspring diabolical.
    Does it a blush raise?--Spirits of evil, speak!--
    Such as expos'd crime brings to mortal cheek?
    Lo, these your works yourselves surpass, I wis;
    Clap hands, ye potentates of the Abyss.
    Rulers of Erebus, is it not a wonder,
    Worthy of Hell's most resonant swift thunder,
    That ye such thing contrived have as Heaven
    Never cast out, nor e'er to Hell was driven?
    Take ye your praise, your praise; this work o' your hands
    Absolute in mischief 'bove compar'son stands.
    Or if ye silent be, your work will speak
    Your praise. Ha, ha! what mean ye that ye shriek
    Thus as I meditate with pulse of fear
    Upon this monster, Woman? Ah, 'tis clear;
    I see your guile and skill. The gods above
    Would have all ills within one scant breast move!
    To bed, Pluto, king of the nether world;
    Sleep on in peace; be every banner furl'd;
    Ye fires, go out; Man's ruin is complete;
    No need of you--in Woman all woes meet:
    In her, ye devils, ye have so contriv'd
    That Tempter, who--better than had ye div'd
    To furthest Tartarus--Man's protecting wall
    Shall breach. Earth's fury--Woman--passes all!        G.

PULCHRA NON DIUTURNA.


    EHEU, ver breve et invidum!
    Eheu, floriduli dies!

    Quin incumbitis; invida

      Quanquam sidereis genis,
    Quae semper nive sobria
    Sinceris spatiis vigent,
    Floris germine simplicis,
    Flagrant ingenuae rosae:
      Quanquam perpetua fide
    Illic mille Cupidines,
    Centum mille Cupidines,
    Pastos nectarea dape,
    Blandis sumptibus educas;
    Istis qui spatiis vagi,
    Plenis lusibus ebrii,
    Udo rore beatuli,

    Istis ex oculis tuis,
    Istis ex oculis suas

    Tum flammis agiles novis
    Lasciva volitant face,
    Tum plenis tumidi minis,
    Tum vel sidera territant,
    Et coelum et fragilem Jovem:
      Quanquam fronte sub ardua
    Majestas gravis excubans,
    Dulces fortiter improbis
    Leges dictat amoribus:
      Quanquam tota, per omnia,
    Coelum machina praeferat,
    Tanquam pagina multiplex
    Vivo scripta volumine,
    Terris indigitans polos.
    Et compendia siderum:
      Istis heu tamen heu genis,
    Istis purpureis genis,
    Oris sidere florido,
    Regno frontis amabili;
    Mors heu crastina forsitan
    Crudeles faciet notas,
    Naturaeque superbiam
    Damnabit tumuli specu.

THE BEAUTIFUL NOT LASTING.

    Alas, how brief and grudg'd our Spring!
    Ah, flow'ry days how vanishing!
    E'en so ye hasten on and on
    With an unceasing motion.
    And thou, sweet Beauty, brightly flashing,
    But all too soon thy fairness dashing,
    To depths of lowest Night must go:
    Ah, losing there thy hasty glow;
    Dark'ning mists around thee clinging,
    And thy loveliness swift-winging:
    A love that brightens to deceive;
    A dream-shadow, fugitive.
      Ye therefore o'er whom Life's young Day
    Shineth still with golden ray,
    Seize--Fate's harsh distaff makes appeal,
    And hoary Time's quick-whirling wheel,
    As round and round the circle spins,
    And to furthest distance wins--
    Seize ye the gliding seasons fleet,
    And dews of vernal Phosphor sweet,
    And new-blown flowers' brightness meet.
    O, what to tender loves ye owe,
    Waste not on Chaos dark below,
    Where pallid ghosts dim-gleaming go.
      Though, Beauty, on thy starry cheeks,
    Where snow's white pureness ever breaks,
    And where gazing, we see born
    Roses fresh without all thorn,
    Buds intertwining undefil'd,
    Spotless as e'er a grace-born child:
      Though thou with everlasting faith
    Fosterest with thy nectar'd breath
    Myriad Loves, and dost them feed
    With honey'd feast of heavenly mead
    In gentle draughts; and they roam round
    In thy realms, and aye are found
    Surfeiting themselves with play
    In one amorous holiday;
    Happy in the drenching dew,
    And seeking ever to renew
    Their torch-flames at thy fair eyes,
    And whet blunt arrows' ecstasies
    With sweet juice that in honey lies:
    And so, with their flame relumed,
    Deftly hover, airy-plumed;
    Waving higher still and higher
    Their torches that raise soft desire;
    Menacing the very stars,
    Yea the old heavens i' their wars:
      Although beneath thy high-arch'd brow
    Sits Majesty, nor doth allow
    To wanton loves such liberty
    As mocks the Ruler of the sky;
    But in their wild career gives pause,
    Imposing on them Love's sweet laws:
      Though thy whole frame in every part
    Sets forth the sky as in a chart;
    Though thy fair face in every look
    Shows heaven in page of living book;
    To Earth reveals the starry skies
    In the bright glances of thine eyes:
      Yet, alas, on these fair cheeks,
    Where the rose all-blushing speaks,
    There shall come the snow's sad whiteness,
    And the red, heart-breaking brightness:
    On the 'human face divine,'
    That as a star doth radiant shine,
    There shall come the deep'ning shadow,
    As clouds across the dappl'd meadow.
    On the high state of the brow
    To-morrow Death may make his blow;
    And all of Nature's bravery
    Gone, in the Grave's cavern lie.
    Alas, the fairest is the fleetest!
    Alas, how short-liv'd is the sweetest!
    Alas, the richest is the rarest!
    Alas, that Death doth spoil the fairest!              G.


HYMNUS VENERI,

DUM IN ILLIUS TUTELAM TRANSEUNT VIRGINES.

    Tu tuis adsis, Venus alme, sacris:
    Rideas blandum, Venus, et benignum,
    Quale cum Martem premis, aureoque
                Frangis ocello.
    Rideas o tum neque flamma Phoebum,
    Nec juvent Phoeben sua tela; gestat
    Te satis contra tuus ille tantum
                Tela Cupido.
    Saepe in ipsius pharetra Dianae
    Hic suas ridens posuit sagittas,
    Ausus et flammae Dominum magistris
                Urere flammis.
    Virginum te orat chorus--esse longum
    Virgines nollent--modo servientum
    Tot columbarum tibi passerumque augere catervam.
    Dedicant quicquid labra vel rosarum
    Colla, vel servant tibi liliorum;
    Dedicant totum tibi ver genarum,
                Ver oculorum.
    Hinc tuo sumas licet arma nato,
    Seu novas his ex oculis sagittas;
    Seu faces flamma velit acriori
                Flave comatas.
    Sume, et o discant quid amica, quid nox,
    Quid bene et blande vigilata nox sit;
    Quid sibi dulcis furor, et protervus
                Poscat amator.
    Sume per quae tot tibi corda flagrant,
    Per quod arcanum tua cestus halat,
    Per tuus quicquid tibi dixit olim aut
                Fecit Adonis.

A HYMN TO VENUS,

WHILE THE VIRGINS PASS UNDER HER PROTECTION.

    Be thou, sweet Venus, present now,
    Whilst at thy sacred rites we vow;
    Smile, Venus, with the smile that charms
    When Mars enfolds thee in his arms,
    O'ercome with glance as sunshine golden,
    Renowned from the ages olden.
    Smile; then Phoebus' flame shall fail,
    Nor Phoebe her own darts avail.
    Thy Cupid only against thee
    Wields successful weaponry.
    Oft and oft the laughing Boy
    In the wildness of his joy
    Has slipt into Diana's quiver
    His keen arrows, that a shiver
    Pleasant-painful send through all,
    When he, trickster, doth enthral.
    Yea, he has dar'd the Lord of Fire
    With flames more burning, in his ire.
      The arm-link'd Virgins to thee pray,
    Seeking thou wouldst near them stay;
    Were it but to offer here,
    In the flock that hovers near,
    More doves and sparrows lightly-flying:
    To their prayer there's no denying.
      Lo, they dedicate in posies
    All their lips supply of roses;
    All their necks, of lilies, white
    As the dewy stainless light;
    Yea, the whole Spring of each cheek,
    And that which from their eyes doth break.
      Hence, Venus, arms thou mayest take
    For thy wanton Boy to make
    Arrows from their fire-darting eyes,
    Or torches flame-tipp'd that surprise
    With Love's delicious agonies.
      Take them, and see thou lett'st them know
    What means a 'mistress;' and then show
    What the Night all-wakeful is
    In the rapture of its bliss;
    What the bold lover shall demand
    When all charms he doth command.
      Take them: by all the hearts that burn,
    And passionate unto thee turn!
    By all the mysteries that are breath'd,
    Or in thine own girdle sheath'd!
    By all to thee Adonis e'er
    Or said or did, when he would swear,
    Ne'er i' the world was one so fair!                  G.

TRANSLATION.

A DESCRIPTION OF SPRING.

    The time is come, when, lord of milder hours,
    The Sun, ascending fresh with larger powers,
    Is wont to woo and soothe the purple Day,
    And, brilliant with its beaming vernal ray,
    To climb with face august the heavenly way;
    All Nature's love, Earth's hope and glory golden,
    To which for garlands virgins are beholden.
    With a glad plenty of all living things
    Sweet tender Spring approaches on soft wings.
    The Year, more beauteous now with offspring new,
    And crown'd with Youth's fresh flowers of every hue,
    Delicious odours pours from happy breast,
    Of fragrant progeny the parent blest:
    O'er verdant fields, blue waters, everywhere,
    At his own wealth he wonders, large and fair.
    By her own Zephyr thirsty Earth unbound
    Drinks eagerly the showers which fall all round;
    While Flora, sitting where tall trees appear,
    Lists, O how happily! as, murmuring near,
    A father-fountain chides its gliding waters,
    Which with curl'd head--alas, unduteous daughters--
    Only look back, and then a garrulous band
    Pursue their laughing way o'er all the land;
    Lists how the sighing, oft-returning air
    Soft prattles to the leafy tresses fair;
    With what sweet whispers it accosts the tree,
    Which with bow'd head makes answer murmuringly;
    Lists, lists again, while through the mournful shade
    Sad Philomel's pathetic plaint is made.
      Now chiefly Venus spreads her empire sweet,
    And calls the world to worship at her feet;
    Now mightier her soft reins shakes to and fro,
    Chiding, and makes her chariot faster go;
    More fiery bids her cestus' powers abound,
    And her warm swelling bosom girds around;
    More glorious now, circl'd by Nymphs and Graces,
    She marches forth, and to her chariot-traces
    She yokes more swans. Nay, freer than before,
    Her Loves themselves, the sunny meadows o'er,
    From her maternal bosom see her pour;
    A thousand horsemen sweet career around,
    Ten thousand wanton footmen scour the ground;
    Part mount the backs of wild beasts as they run,
    And their own goad-like arrows ply in fun;
    Part seek wing'd flight to urge with double speed,
    And so ascend each one an airy steed;
    One, vaulting on a sparrow, flits away;
    Here see him lightly shine, there brightly play,
    In no place long; now resting here, now yonder,
    Wherever shadows woo them, lo, they wander.
    One, rising mightier than her heavy reins,
    His Mother's birds attempts with lighter chains.
    One, bee-like, brave o'erthrows an angry bee,
    Only another self in him to see;
    In tiny circles they awhile revolve,
    But soon their interlacing flight dissolve.
    Part, lightly flitting o'er the meadows fair,
    Strive their own lilies with meet rose to pair.
    Now flowery tribes in fragrant counsel stand,
    Amid the buds wantons the joyous band.
    New glory on their shining pinions rests,
    A golden harvest settles on their breasts;
    With sweeten'd locks to odorous shades they go,
    Their arrows, weapons harsh, away they throw,
    While other arms their smiling quivers show.
    Flowers in their hand, flowers in their breast, are seen,
    On every side appears a flowery sheen.
    One Love, reclin'd beside a glassy stream,
    Admires the nature of the illusive gleam,
    The liquid likeness of his wavering face,
    And tremulous deceit of imag'd grace.
    Thence, his own rays examining, he tries
    And fashions, as the Nymph may chance advise,
    That braver fires may tremble in his eyes;
    His mobile face new lightnings flashes far,
    With rays more wanton, bickering like a star.     R. WI.


PRISCIANUS VERBERANS ET VAPULANS.

    The two following poems--somewhat out of character, so to say, with
    Crashaw--were probably prepared for a tractate, which it has been
    our good fortune to hap on in the Bodleian. It is a Latin burlesque
    Poem, filling a small 4to of 20 pages, with this title:


    EN
    PRISCIANUS
    VERBERANS
    ET
    VAPULANS.

    Jam publicato verberans aures stylo
    Qua penis iterum vapulet, metuit crisin.


    Londini

    Excudebat Augustinus Mathewes impensis
    Roberti Mulbourne ad insigne
    Canis venatici in coemeterio Paulino.   1632.

    The words 'Priscianus Verberans et Vapulans' remind us of the
    once-famous 'Comoedia' of Nicodemus Freschlin; but the later poem
    shows no reminiscence of the earlier. These details will doubtless
    interest and amuse in relation to Crashaw's pieces. Priscianus,
    otherwise Nisus, a schoolmaster, whips a boy who broke and dirtied
    his whipping-horse, and the boy's parents bring an action against
    him for assault. The place is evidently Aldborough in
    Suffolk--illumined by the genius of Crabbe--and the name of the
    boy's family Coleman. The poem thus begins and proceeds--the
    marginal notes being placed at the bottom of our pages:

    Pinguibus in populi, qui dicitur Austricus,[101] arvis
    Praeturam, fasces, lictores nuper adepta
    Villa[102] antiqua, novo jam Burgi turget honore.

    He describes the school:

    Vicinae senior Carbonius[3] incola villae,
    'Lingua vernacula idem quod {anthrakandros},

    sends his son as a scholar: the stipend 20_s._ a year:

    De stipe[103] consentit genitor: Carbunculus intrat.

    He describes the whipping-block, the judicious use of which saves
    boys from the gallows:

                        Iste caballus
    Non in perniciem, non urbis ut ille ruinam         _the Trojan_
    Sed curam imberbis populi, regimenque salubre:
    A triplici ligno[104] lignum hoc penate tuetur
    Praecipitem aetatem.

    Young Coleman plays truant from school, and one day, when the school
    is empty, breaks and defiles the horse. He openly boasts of his
    feat, and returning another day to repeat his misdeed, is caught by
    Nisus, who mounts him on the injured horse, which, by poetical
    license, is made to whinny with content. The youth expects twenty
    cuts, and receives four:

    Quattuor[105] inflixit tantum mediocriter ictus,
    Plures optet equus, plures daret arbiter aequus.

    Coleman senior calls on the Schoolmaster, who remarks that payment
    for his son's schooling is in arrear. Coleman returns with Mrs.
    Coleman, and demands a receipt for the payment, which he makes, as
    Nisus discovers, lest a counter-action be brought against him:

    Vult sibi ut absolvens[106] accepti latio detur
    Consignata manu Nisi, atque a teste probata.

    Then Mrs. Coleman shows herself deserving of the cucking-stool:

                    ..... bona Carbonissa
    Inque caput Nisi cumulata opprobria plaustro
    Digna et rixivomas sub aquis mersante[107] cathedra,
    Quinetiam manibus quasi pugnatura lacessit.

    They bring their action for assault. (The English words in the
    marginal notes, placed below, are in black-letter:)

    Nulla mora est, juristam adhibent, de fonte dicarum
    Qui populo Placita ad Communia[108] panditur, exit
    Schedula quod vulgo[109] Regis Breve dicitur: illo
    Mox capitur Nisus, geminoque sub obside spondet
    In responsurum praescripto tempore: tempus
    Cunctarum[110] lux est animarum crastini. Verum
    Actor quis?[111] Puer ipse, virum qui provocat, annos
    Nondum bis-senos superans. Sed et actio quaenam?
    Quid crimen? Pravus atque atrox injuria, tristes
    Et tragicae ambages, ampullae sesquipedales,
    Quod[112] Regis contra pacem vi Nisus, et armis
    Insultum fecit, male tractans verbere saevo
    Verberibus diris adeo, plenisque pericli
    De pueri vita ut desperaretur.

    The poem ends, leaving poor Nisus in the midst of his first
    law-suit:

                        Ecce
    Nisus, jam primum Nisus miser ambulat in jus:

    and the marginal note is 'In causis litigiosis sive casibus
    inscriptionum stylus Johannes de Stiles versus Johannem de Nokes.' A
    concluding chronogram gives the year 1629:

    LVDI MagIster LIte VeXatVr forI.

    The Schoolmaster's friends have written him complimentary epigrams,
    which are prefixed to his poem. One is worth reproducing, ae it has
    an echo of Crashaw's:

          Ad {koprochrysounta}
    Suavia nonnulli lutulento carmine narrant:
        Turpia tu nitido, Nise poeta, places.

    In black-letter, as follows:

    Some cloath faire tales in sluttish eloquence:
    Thy tale is foule, thy verse is frankincense.

    T. Lovering Artium Ludiq. Magister.

    There seems little doubt that Crashaw's two poems were born of this
    anonymous tractate. Cf. 'rixivomas' (p. 310) with 'vomitivam' and
    'rixosa volumina linguae.' Biographically they and others secular
    have a special interest and value. My good friend Rev. Richard
    Wilton, as before, has very happily translated these playthings. G.

    Quid facis? ah, tam perversa quid volvitur ira?
      Quid parat iste tuus, posterus iste furor?
    Ah, truculente puer, tam foedo parce furori.
      Nec rapiat tragicas tam gravis ira nates.
    Ecce fremit, fremit ecce indignabundus Apollo.
      Castalides fugiunt, et procul ora tegunt.
    Sic igitur sacrum, sic insedisse caballum
      Quaeris? et, ah, fieri tam male notus eques?
    Ille igitur phaleris nitidus lucebit in istis?
      Haec erit ad solidum turpis habena latus?
    His ille, haud nimium rigidis, dabit ora lupatis?
      Haec fluet in miseris sordida vitta jubis?
    Sic erit ista tui, sic aurea pompa triumphi?
      Ille sub imperiis ibit olentis heri?
    Ille tamen neque terribili stat spumeus ira;
      Ungula nec celso fervida calce tonat.
    O merito spectatur equi patientia nostri!
      Dicite Io, tantum quis toleravit equus?
    Pegasus iste ferox, mortales spretus habenas.
      Bellerophontaea non tulit ire manu.
    Noster equus tamen exemplo non turget in isto:
      Stat bonus, et solito se pede certus habet.
    Imo licet tantos de te tulit ille pudores,
      Te tulit ille iterum, sed meliore modo.
    Tunc rubor in scapulas O quam bene transiit iste,
      Qui satis in vultus noluit ire tuos!
    At mater centum in furias abit, et vomit iram
      Mille modis rabidam jura, forumque fremit.
    Quin fera tu taceas; aut jura forumque tacebunt:
      Tu legi vocem non sinis esse suam.
    O male vibratae rixosa volumina linguae,
      Et satis in nullo verba tonanda foro!
    Causidicos, vesana! tuos tua fulmina terrent.
      Ecce stupent miseri, ah, nec meminere loqui.
    Hinc tua, foede puer, foedati hinc terga caballi
      Exercent querulo jurgia lenta foro.
    Obscaenas lites, et olentia jurgia ridet
      Turpiter in causam sollicitata Themis.
    Juridicus lites quisquis tractaverit istas,
      O satis emuncta nare sit ille, precor,
    At tu de misero quid vis, truculente, caballo?
      Cur premis insultans, saeve, tyranne puer!
    Tene igitur fugiet? fugiet sacer iste caballus?
      Non fugiet, sed, si vis, tibi terga dabit.[113]

PRISCIANUS BEATING AND BEING BEATEN.

    What wouldest thou? why rolls thy wayward ire?
    What means that rage of thine dirty and dire?
    Ah, savage boy, such fury foul forbear,
    Nor let thy wrath those tragic buttocks tear.
    Apollo, all indignant, groans and sighs;
    The Muses flee, and hide them from thine eyes.
    Thus dost thou seek to sit the sacred steed?
    Thus to become a horseman fam'd indeed!
    In such adornment shall he brightly shine?
    His firm flank lash'd by this base whip of thine?
    His mouth to this loose bit shall he deliver?
    O'er his poor mane this filthy fillet quiver?
    In golden triumph thus shalt thou proceed,
    So rank a lord bestriding such a steed?
    Yet foaming with dire rage he does not stand,
    Nor with hot hoof go thundering o'er the land.
    Our horse's patience is a wond'rous sight!
    O, say, what horse before endur'd such wight?
    Old Pegasus, despising mortal sway,
    Bellerophon's strong hand disdain'd to obey:
    And yet with no such rage swells this our horse;
    Quiet he stands, and holds his wonted course.
    Nay, though he bore such shame from thee that day,
    Again he bore thee--in a better way!
    Then to thy shoulders fitly pass'd the blush,
    Which to thy countenance refus'd to rush.
    His mother furious raves and wildly splutters
    A thousand spites, and of the law-courts mutters.
    Peace, woman! or the law-courts thou wilt awe;
    Thou dost not leave its own voice to the Law.
    O fractious eddies of the brandish'd tongue,
    Such words as in no law-court ever rung.
    Thy very lawyers from thy thunders hide:
    Lo, they forget to speak, as stupefied.
    Thus, thus, foul boy, thy fouled horse's hide
    By wrangling law-court's tedious strife is plied.
    While Justice, summon'd to a cause so vile,
    Views the rank strife obscene with scornful smile.
    Whatever judge such nasty action tries,
    See that he blow his nose well, I advise.
    But why wouldst thou, cruel, tyrannic boy,
    With thy insulting weight that horse annoy?
    That sacred steed, will it, then, from thee flee?--
    'Twill not turn tail, but lend its back to thee!  R. WI.

    On this vile theme thee we congratulate,
    O golden Muse, pleasing and delicate;
    This fair white vileness, Muse, which by its own
    Or name or face is now no longer known.
    For, charm'd by thy poetic sacred strain,
    It knows not, happily, itself again;
    But with new face wonders at its new splendour--
    For splendid e'en a vile theme thou canst render:
    Congratulations for vile theme we tender.
    For had not _he_,[114] with headlong buttocks base,
    Gone flashing foully on with thunderous pace,
    From whence would this avenging plant have sprung,
    This solemn strain with polish'd music rung?
    And whence had gather'd these brave angers tender?
    O Muse, the vilest theme can bring thee splendour,
    For which congratulations now we render.
      Thy Hippocrene comes with a fair face,
    Finely unworthy of its father base;
    Of a foul fountain so serene a daughter:
    From dunghill, who would dream such crystal water?
      Thus rise, O Muse, O rise, a milk-white queen,
    Out of the midst of vileness rise serene.
    Even as Venus rising from her spray,
    When she discover'd to the light of day
    Her golden limbs, the billowy waves surprising
    With the first glory of her purple rising;
    So rise, O Muse, thy milk-white grace unfold;
    Ennius' dunghill will be Virgil's gold!           R. WI.

NOTE.

    While we do not deem it expedient to translate this somewhat coarse
    _jeu d'esprit_, its sentiment and allusions will be found
    anticipated in the lines 'To the Reader, upon the Author his
    Kins-man,' prefixed to 'Follie's Anatomie; or Satyres and Satyricall
    Epigrams; with a compendious History of Ixion's Wheele. Compiled by
    Henry Hutton, Dunelmensis.' London, 1619 (pp. 3-4)--which we give
    here:

    Old Homer in his time made a great feast,
    And every Poet was thereat a guest:
    All had their welcome, yet not all one fare;
    To them above the salt (his chiefest care)
    He spread a banquet of choice Poesie,
    Whereon they fed even to satietie.
    The lower end had from that end their cates;
    For Homer, setting open his dung-gates,
    Delivered from that dresser excrement,
    Whereon they glutted, and returned in print.
    Let no man wonder that I this rehearse;
    Nought came from Homer but it turned to verse.
    Now where our Author was, at this good cheere,
    Where was his place, or whether he were there;
    Whether he waited, or he tooke away,
    Of this same point I cannot soothly say.
    But this I ghesse: being then a dandiprat,
    Some witty Poet took him on his lap,
    And fed him, from above, with some choice bit.
    Hence his acumen, and a ready wit.
    But prayers from a friendly pen ill thrive,
    And truth's scarce truth, spoke by a relative.
    Let envy, therefore, give her vote herein:
    Envy and th' Author sure are nought akin.
    He personate bad Envy; yet say so,
    He lickt at Homer's mouth, not from below.      R[ALPH] H[UTTON].

CUM HORUM ALIQUA DEDICARAM

PRAECEPTORI MEO COLENDISSIMO, AMICO AMICISSIMO, R. BROOKE.[115]

En tibi Musam, Praeceptor colendissime, quas ex tuis modo scholis, quasi
ex Apollinis officina, accepit alas timide adhuc, nec aliter quam sub
oculis tuis jactitantem.

    Qualiter e nido multa jam floridus ala
    Astra sibi meditatur avis, pulchrosque meatus
    Aerios inter proceres, licet aethera nunquam
    Expertus, rudibusque illi sit in ardua pennis
    Prima fides, micat ire tamen, quatiensque decora
    Veste leves humeros, querulumque per aera ludens
    Nil dubitat vel in astra vagos suspendere nisus,
    At vero simul immensum per inane profundis
    Exhaustus spatiis, vacuoque sub aethere pendens,
    Arva procul sylvasque suas, procul omnia cernit,
    Cernere quae solitus: tum vero victa cadit mens,
    Spesque suas, et tanta timens conamina, totus
    Respicit ad matrem, pronisque revertitur auris.

Quod tibi enim haec feram, vir ornatissime, non ambitio dantis est, sed
justitia reddentis; neque te libelli mei tam elegi patronum, quam
dominum agnosco. Tua sane sunt haec et mea; neque tamen ita mea sunt,
quin si quid in illis boni est, tuum hoc sit totum, neque interim in
tantum tua, ut quantumcumque est in illis mali, illud non sit ex integro
meum. Ita medio quodam et misto jure utriusque sunt, ne vel mihi, dum me
in societatem tuarum laudum elevarem, invidiam facerem; vel injuriam
tibi, ut qui te in tenuitatis meae consortium deducere conarer. Ego enim
de meo nihil ausim boni mecum agnoscere, nedum profiteri palam, praeter
hoc unum, quo tamen nihil melius, animum nempe non ingratum tuorum
beneficiorum historiam religiosissima fide in se reponentem. Hoc
quibuscumque testibus coram, hoc palam in os coeli meaeque conscientiae
meum jacto effero me in hoc ultra aemuli patientiam. Enim vero
elegantiore obsequio venerentur te, et venerantur scio, tuorum alii:
nemo me sincero magis vel ingenuo poterit. Horum denique rivulorum,
tenuium utcunque nulliusque nominis, haec saltem laus erit propria, quod
suum nempe norint Oceanum.


TRANSLATION.

WHEN I HAD DEDICATED CERTAIN OF MY POEMS

TO MY MOST ESTIMABLE PRECEPTOR AND MOST FRIENDLY FRIEND, R. BROOKE.

'Well done, Muse!' was thy encouraging word, most estimable Praeceptor;
'Well done, Muse!' fluttering its wings, which it received from thy
School of late, as from Apollo's workshop, timidly as yet, nor otherwise
than beneath thine eyes.

      Like as a nestling, feather'd gaily o'er,
    Is meditating towards the stars to soar,
    And in ambitious flights already vies
    With the wing'd chiefs that skim along the skies:
    What though he never has essay'd the air,
    And needs must trust in plumes untried to bear
    Unwonted burden heavenward? yet he quivers
    To stretch his wings, and his fair plumage shivers
    Round his light shoulders till he flits away,
    While whispering airs against his pinions play;
    Nor dreams he will suspend his wandering flight
    Anywhere short of regions starry bright.
    But when exhausted by the spaces high
    And the immeasurable void of sky,
    Hovering in empty air, far off he sees
    The fields and hedges and familiar trees--
    O, how far off!--which used his sight to please;
    Then sudden overpower'd behold him sink,
    And from his hopes and lofty soarings shrink:
    To his dear mother his whole soul looks back,
    And down he flutters on the homeward track.

That I offer thee these poems, most honourable Sir, is not the ambitious
desire to give, but the righteous wish to restore what is due. And I
have not chosen thee so much the patron of my little book, as I
recognise thee to be its owner. Thine indeed these things are, and mine:
nor yet are they so much mine, but that if there is anything good in
them, this is wholly thine; nor at the same time are they so far thine,
that everything bad in them is not entirely mine. Thus, by a sort of
common and joint right, they belong to each of us; lest either I should
bring envy to myself, while I presumed to a share of thy praises, or
injury to thee, by endeavouring to drag thee down to association with my
feebleness. For concerning anything belonging to me, I should not
venture even to myself to admit any merit, much less to proclaim it
openly, except this one thing, than which there is nothing more
excellent--namely, a mind not ungrateful, and cherishing in itself with
most punctilious fidelity the record of thy kindnesses.

This in the presence of any witnesses, this openly in the face of heaven
and to my own conscience, I boast of as my own. I proclaim myself in
this particular incapable of enduring a rival; for others of thy
admirers [pupils] may venerate thee, and do venerate thee, with more
polite attention, but none will be able to do so with observance more
sincere and felt. In conclusion; of these rivulets, however slender they
may be and of no name, this at least will be the fitting praise--that at
all events they know their own Ocean. R. WI.


IN OBITUM REV. V. D^{ris} MANSELL,

COLL. REGIN. M^{ri} QUI VEN. D^{s} BROOKE [M^{ri} COLL. TRIN.],
INTERITUM PROXIME SECUTUS EST.[116]

    Ergo iterum in lacrymas et saevi murmura planctus
      Ire jubet tragica mors iterata manu;
    Scilicet illa novas quae jam fert dextra sagittas,
      Dextra priore recens sanguine stillat adhuc.
    Vos o, quos socia Lachesis prope miscuit urna,
      Et vicina colus vix sinit esse duos;
    Ite o, quos nostri jungunt consortia damni;
      Per nostras lacrymas o nimis ite pares;
    Ite per Elysias felici tramite valles,
      Et sociis animos conciliate viis.
    Illic ingentes ultro confundite manes,
      Noscat et aeternam mutua dextra fidem.
    Communes eadem spargantur in otia curae,
      Atque idem felix poscat utrumque labor.
    Nectarae simul ite vagis sermonibus horae;
      Nox trahat alternas continuata vices.
    Una cibos ferat, una suas vocet arbor in umbras;
      Ambobus faciles herba det una toros.
    Certum erit interea quanto sit major habenda
      Quam quae per vitam est, mortis amicitia.

ON THE DEATH OF REV. DR. MANSELL,

MASTER OF QUEEN'S COLLEGE, WHICH FOLLOWED VERY CLOSELY THE DECEASE OF
REV. DR. BROOKE.[117]

    In tears once more and sighs of cruel woe
    Death's tragic stroke repeated bids us go;
    That fatal hand, which now bears arrows new,
    Still freshly drips with former crimson dew.
    Ye whom Fate almost mingl'd in one urn,
    Whom to be two, close threads forbid discern;
    Go ye, who equally our sorrows share,
    By reason of our tears too much a pair;
    Go where Elysian vales your steps invite,
    In social paths your happy souls unite;
    There mix your mighty shades with willing mind,
    Eternal faith your blended right-hands find.
    Let common cares be lost in the same joys,
    While the same happy labour both employs;
    Through nectar'd hours in talk together range,
    And night continue the sweet interchange:
    One tree bear fruit for both, one tree yield shade,
    On the same turf your pleasant couch be made;
    Thus how much better will be plainly seen
    Friendship of Death than that of life, I ween.    R. WI.


HONORATISSIMO DR. ROBERTO HEATH,

SUMMO JUSTIT. DE COM. BANCO, GRATULATIO.[118]

    Ignitum latus et sacrum tibi gratulor ostrum,
      O amor atque tuae gloria magna togae:
    Nam video Themis ecce humeris, Themis ardet in istis,
      Inque tuos gaudet tota venire sinus.
    O ibi purpureo quam se bene porrigit astro,
      Et docet hic radios luxuriare suos.
    Imo eat aeterna sic o Themis aurea pompa;
      Hic velit o sidus semper habere suum.
    Sic flagret, et nunquam tua purpura palleat intus;
      O nunquam in vultus digna sit ire tuos.
    Sanguine ab innocuo nullos bibat illa rubores;
      Nec tam crudeli murice proficiat.
    Quaeque tibi est (nam quae non est tibi?) candida virtus
      Fortunam placide ducat in alta tuam.
    Nullius viduae lacrymas tua marmora sudent;
      Nec sit, quae inclamet te, tibi facta domus.
    Non gemat ulla suam pinus tibi scissa ruinam,
      Ceu cadat in domini murmure maesta sui.
    Fama suas subter pennas tibi sternat eunti;
      Illa tubae faciat te melioris opus.
    Thura tuo, quacunque meat, cum nomine migrent;
      Quaeque vehit felix te, vehat aura rosas.
    Vive tuis, nec enim non sunt aequissima, votis
      Aequalis, quae te sidera cunque vocant.
    Haec donec niveae cedat tua purpura pallae,
      Lilium ibi fuerit, quae rosa vestis erat.

TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD ROBERT HEATH,

ON HIS BEING MADE A JUDGE: A CONGRATULATION.[119]

    Upon thy sacred purple, barr'd with fire,
    I gratulate thee--glorious, lov'd attire!
    For on those shoulders I see Justice shine,
    And glad to hide within those folds of thine.
    O finely there she shoots her purple beam,
    And teaches here her rays brightly to gleam.
    May Justice thus in pomp eternal go,
    Here always wish her golden star to glow!
    Thus blaze, and ne'er thy purple pale its blush,
    And never need into thy face to flush.
    From innocent blood ne'er drink a deeper dye,
    And turn more crimson from such cruelty.
    Let all fair virtues--for thou ownest all--
    Calmly to heaven above thy footsteps call.
    No widows' tears thy marble halls distil,
    No house cry out against thee, built by ill;
    No timber cut for thee its downfall groan,
    'Mid its lord's murmurs sadly overthrown.
    May Fame spread out her wings beneath thy feet,
    And thee with loud applause her trumpet greet!
    May incense waft thy name where'er it goes,
    The happy gale which bears thee bear the rose!
    Live equal to thy prayers, most just are they,
    Whatever stars direct thee on thy way,
    Till this thy purple turn to robe of snow,
    And where the rose had been, the lily glow!       R. WI.

Latin Poems.

PART SECOND. SECULAR.

ROYAL AND ACADEMICAL.


NOTE.

    In our Preface to the present Volume we give the title-pages of the
    original publications wherein appeared the Royal and Academical
    Poems of this section; in the translation of which I owe again
    thanks to the friends of the former divisions, as their initials
    show; and another, Professor Sole, of St. Mary's College, Oscott,
    Birmingham, to whom I am indebted for that bearing his initials. One
    to the 'Princess,' celebrated before, is here printed as well as
    translated for the first time, as noted in the place. It was deemed
    preferable to include it with the others rather than among those
    hitherto unprinted. For brief notices of the various Royal and
    Academical celebrities of these poems, see Memorial-Introduction and
    related English poems in Vol. I. and notes in their places in the
    present Volume.

    Once more I note here the chief errors of Turnbull's text: 'Ad
    Carolum,' &c. l. 11, 'perrerati' for 'pererrati;' l. 26, 'discere'
    for 'dicere:' in 'In Serenissimae Reginae' &c. the heading is
    'Senerissimae;' l. 14, 'tuos' for 'tuus;' l. 41, 'Namque' for 'Nam
    quae;' l. 43, 'Junus' for 'Janus:' in 'Principi recens' &c. l. 4,
    'eum' for 'cum;' l. 10, 'lato' for 'late;' l. 22, 'imperiosus' for
    'imperiosior;' l. 26, 'quoque' for 'quoquo;' l. 30, 'melle' for
    'molle:' in 'Ad Reginam,' l. 35, 'aure' for 'auree:' in 'Votiva
    Domus' &c. l. 20, 'tenerae' for 'tremulae;' l. 25, 'jam' for 'bene;'
    l. 26, 'mulcent' for 'mulceat;' l. 29, 'minium' for 'nimium;' l. 40,
    'ora' for 'ara;' l. 45, 'volvit' for 'volvat;' l. 50, 'motus ad
    oras' for 'nidus ad aras:' in 'Ejusdem caeterorum' &c. l. 5,
    'natalis' for 'natales;' l. 15, 'qua' for 'quo;' l. 31, 'longe' for
    'longo:' in 'Venerabili viro magistro Tournay' &c. l. 8, 'vixerit'
    for 'vexerit;' l. 21, 'tuos est' for 'tuas eat;' ll. 24, 27, and 28,
    'est' for 'eat:' in 'Or. viro praeceptori' &c. l. 6, 'metuendas' for
    'metuendus;' l. 20, 'est' for 'eat.' G.




AD CAROLUM PRIMUM:

REX REDUX.[120]


    Ille redit, redit. Hoc populi bona murmura volvunt;
      Publicus hoc, audin'? plausus ad astra refert:
    Hoc omni sedet in vultu commune serenum;
      Omnibus hinc una est laetitiae facies.
    Rex noster, lux nostra redit; redeuntis ad ora
      Arridet totis Anglia laeta genis:
    Quisque suos oculos oculis accendit ab istis;
      Atque novum sacro sumit ab ore diem.
    Forte roges tanto quae digna pericula plausu
      Evadat Carolus, quae mala quosve metus:
    Anne pererrati male fida volumina ponti
      Ausa illum terris pene negare suis:
    Hospitis an nimii rursus sibi conscia tellus
      Vix bene speratum reddat Ibera caput.
    Nil horum; nec enim male fida volumina ponti
      Aut sacrum tellus vidit Ibera caput.
    Verus amor tamen haec sibi falsa pericula fingit--
      Falsa peric'la solet fingere verus amor;
    At Carolo qui falsa timet, nec vera timeret--
      Vera peric'la solet temnere verus amor;
    Illi falsa timens, sibi vera pericula temnens,
      Non solum est fidus, sed quoque fortis amor.
    Interea nostri satis ille est causa triumphi:
      Et satis, ah, nostri causa doloris erat.
    Causa doloris erat Carolus, sospes licet esset;
      Anglia quod saltem dicere posset, abest.
    Et satis est nostri Carolus nunc causa triumphi:
      Dicere quod saltem possumus: Ille redit.


TRANSLATION.

THE RETURN OF THE KING.

    'The King returns!' the people cry;
    And shouts of greeting scale the sky.
    The news sits in each look serene;
    In each a common joy is seen.
    Our King! our light! she laughs once more,
    Glad Anglia, as he gains her shore.
    Each at the King's eyes lights his eyes;
    Sees new day with his face arise.
    You'll ask, what fears beset his way,
    What ills, what dangers,--we're so gay:
    If 'gainst his bark, that sail'd for home,
    The faithless billows dar'd to foam;
    Or if, so seldom blest, you plann'd
    To keep him still, Iberian land.
    Nor waves have wrong'd his saintly head,
    Nor green Iberia felt his tread.
    Yet think such fancies true love will--
    True love, that feigns false perils still:
    Us such fears vex, whose hearts are stout--
    True perils still true love will scout:
    Thus fear false perils, scorn the true,
    Will trusty love and brave in you.
    O fitly we kept cloudy brow,
    Because of him, as laughter now.
    When we could say, 'Our King's not here,'
    We griev'd for him, no danger near:
    Now our hearts can no least joy lack,
    When we say, laughing, 'He's come back.'              A.


AD PRINCIPEM NONDUM NATUM,

REGINA GRAVIDA.[121]

    Nascere nunc, o nunc; quid enim, puer alme, moraris?
      Nulla tibi dederit dulcior hora diem.
    Ergone tot tardos, o lente, morabere menses?
      Rex redit; ipse veni, et dic, bone, gratus ades.
    Nam quid ave nostrum? quid nostri verba triumphi?
      Vagitu melius dixeris ista tuo.
    At maneas tamen, et nobis nova causa triumphi:
      Sic demum fueris; nec nova causa tamen:
    Nam quoties Carolo novus aut nova nascitur infans,
      Revera toties Carolus ipse redit.


TRANSLATION.

TO THE ROYAL INFANT NOT YET BORN,

THE QUEEN BEING WITH CHILD.

    Be born, O, now; for why, fair child, delay?
    No sweeter hour will bring to thee the day.
    So many months wilt linger on the wing?
    The King returns; come thou, and welcome bring.
    What is our hail? our voice of triumph high?
    Thou wilt have said these better with thy cry.
    But stay; and soon new cause of triumph be;
    And yet in thee no new cause shall we see:
    Oft as to Charles is born new girl, new boy,
    Sure Charles himself returns, and brings us joy.  R. WI.




IN FACIEM AUGUSTISSIMI REGIS

A MORBILLIS INTEGRAM.[122]


    Musa redi, vocat alma parens Aeademia: noster
      En redit, ore suo noster Apollo redit;
    Vultus adhuc suus, et vultu sua purpura tantum
      Vivit, et admixtas pergit amare nives.
    Tune illas violare genas? tune illa profanis,
      Morbe ferox, tentas ire per ora notis?
    Tu Phoebi faciem tentas, vanissime? Nostra
      Nec Phoebe maculas novit habere suas.
    Ipsa sui vindex facies morbum indignatur;
      Ipsa sedet radiis o bene tuta suis:
    Quippe illic Deus est. coelumque et sanctius astrum:
      Quippe sub his totus ridet Apollo genis.
    Quod facie Rex tutus erat, quod caetera tactus:
      Hinc hominem Rex est fassus, et inde Deum.


TRANSLATION.

TO THE FACE OF THE MOST AUGUST KING.

UNINJURED BY SMALL-POX.

    Come, Muse, at call of thy Academy:
    With his own face our Phoebus here we see;
    His face his own yet, with its own red dyed,
    Which with its whiteness loves to be allied.
    O fierce disease, dost thou, with marks profane,
    Attempt these cheeks, that countenance, to stain?
    Most futile! Dost attempt our Phoebus' face?
    Not in our Phoebe her own spots canst trace.
    His self-asserting face disdains disease;
    'Mid its own rays it sits, O well at ease.
    Sure God and heaven and holiest star are here;
    Sure 'neath these cheeks smiles Phoebus full and clear.
    Our King being safe in face, but touch'd elsewhere,
    Proves he was here a god, though a man there.     R. WI.


IN SERENISSIMAE REGINAE

PARTUM HIEMALEM.[123]

    Serta, puer; quis nunc flores non praebeat hortus?
      Texe mihi facili pollice serta puer.
    Quid tu nescio quos narras mihi; stulte, Decembres
      Quid mihi cum nivibus? da mihi serta, puer.
    Nix et hiems? non est nostras quid tale per oras;
      Non est, vel si sit, non tamen esse potest.
    Ver agitur: quaecunque trucem dat larva Decembrem,
      Quid fera cunque fremant frigora, ver agitur.
    Nonne vides quali se palmite regia vitis
      Prodit, et in sacris quae sedet uva jugis?
    Tam laetis quae bruma solet ridere racemis?
      Quas hiemis pingit purpure tanta genas?
    O Maria, o divum soboles, genitrixque deorum,
      Siccine nostra tuus tempora ludus erunt?
    Siccine tu cum vere tuo nihil horrida brumae
      Sidera, nil madidos sola morare notos?
    Siccine sub media poterunt tua surgere bruma,
      Atque suas solum lilia nosse nives?
    Ergo vel invitis nivibus frendentibus Austris,
      Nostra novis poterunt regna tumere rosis?
    O bona turbatrix anni, quae limite noto
      Tempora sub signis non sinis ire suis;
    O pia praedatrix hiemis, quae tristia mundi
      Murmura tam dulci sub ditione tenes;
    Perge, precor, nostris vim pulchram ferre calendis;
      Perge, precor, menses sic numerare tuos.
    Perge intempestiva atque importuna videri;
      Inque uteri titulos sic rape cuncta tui.
    Sit nobis sit saepe hiemes sic cernere nostras
      Exhaeredatas floribus ire tuis.
    Saepe sit has vernas hiemes Maiosque Decembres,
      Has per te roseas saepe videre nives.
    Altera gens varium per sidera computet annum,
      Atque suos ducant per vaga signa dies:
    Nos deceat nimiis tantum permittere nimbis?
      Tempora tam tetricas ferre Britanna vices?
    Quin nostrum tibi nos omnem donabimus annum:
      In partus omnem expende, Maria, tuos.
    Sic tuus ille uterus nostri bonus arbiter anni:
      Tempus et in titulos transeat omne tuos.
    Namque alia indueret tam dulcia nomina mensis?
      Aut qua tam posset candidus ire toga?
    Hanc laurum Janus sibi vertice vellet utroque:
      Hanc sibi vel tota Chloride Maius emet.
    Tota suam, vere expulso, respublica florum
      Reginam cuperent te sobolemve tuam.
    O bona sors anni, cum cuncti ex ordine menses
      Hic mihi Carolides, hic Marianus erit!

    Garlands! bring garlands, boy! what garden now
    Would not give flowers? with ready hand do thou
    Weave garlands. What! December, sayst thou,--snow?
    Fool! hold thy blabbing, speak of what we know.
    Winter upon our shores, and snow? the thing
    Is not, and cannot be. It is the Spring:
    Whatever ghost threatens us with the drear
    Beatings of wild December, Spring is here.
    See'st thou not with what leaves the royal vine
    Spreads forth, what clusters on her boughs incline?
    Say, when like this was Winter ever seen
    To laugh and glow in purple? O great Queen,
    Offspring of gods, and mother! do we see
    The seasons thus a plaything made for thee?
    Thus with thy Spring mayst thou the stars restrain,
    That Winter sting not, nor the South bring rain.
    And do the lilies by thy grace alone
    Spring up, and know no snows except their own?
    In spite of all that Winter may oppose,
    Are thus our kingdoms blooming with the rose?
    O thou most blest disturber of the year,
    Who sufferest not the bounded seasons here
    To keep i' their own signs! destroyer kind
    Of Winter, whose sweet influence can bind
    All harsher murmurs of the world, still dare
    We pray thee, thus to force our calendar
    With thy fair violence; continue still
    The months to number at thine own sweet will;
    Still thus untimely, still thus burdensome,
    Make all things subject to thy royal womb.
    So, by thy grace, may it be often ours
    To see dethroned Winter deck'd in flowers;
    On snow that falls i' roses still to gaze,
    Sweet vernal Winters and December Mays!
    Let others by the stars compute their year,
    And count their days as wandering signs appear:
    Not so we Britons; not for us shall storm
    With cruel change our seasons dare deform;
    To thee, great Queen, our whole year we resign,
    O spend it all i' those rich births of thine!
    So the whole year shall own thy womb to be
    Its sovereign arbitress of good; in thee
    Merge all its titles. Where's the month could bear
    A more delicious name, or ever wear
    More whiteness? Janus, for his double crown,
    Covets this laurel; Maius for his own
    Would buy it, though his Chloris were the cost.
    Thee or thine infant, now that Spring has lost
    His ancient throne, the flow'ry states invite
    To take their empire. O blest year, how bright
    Thy fortunes, where each month in turn may claim
    From Mary or from Charles its mighty name!            G.

    Inque ipsa vires carmina suggerit,

    Quin experiri pergat, et in vices
    Certare sanctis conditionibus:
    Lis dulcis est, nec indecoro
              Pulvere, sic potuisse vinci.
    Alternis Natura diem meditatur et umbras,
      Hinc atro, hinc albo pignore facta parens.
    Tu melior Natura tuas, dulcissima, servas--
      Sed quam dissimili sub ratione!--vices.
    Candida tu, et partu semper tibi concolor omni:
      Hinc natam, hinc natum das; sed utrinque diem.

TO THE QUEEN.

    Hither, Muse, and bring again
    Thy august surrounding train;
    With measur'd tread of practis'd feet
    Come, for thou hast learn'd to greet
    With the voice of loyal cheer
    A princely cradle year by year.
    Lo, our noble Queen on thee
    Calls in fruitful rivalry
    By another birth; and he,
    Illustrious infant, needs must have
    The Muses' offspring for his slave.
    Never has she yet been known
    A mother for herself alone,
    But by a reflected might
    Even in absence doth delight
    In twins ever, and while she
    Thus augments her progeny,
    And gives vigour to the lyre,
    She doth at once with life inspire
    Young princes, and the Muses' quire.
    These, though not untouch'd they be
    With the sacred flame, may she
    Tire in her fruitful deity,
    And with joys that theirs outrun,
    Dry at last all Helicon!
    Sweet is the strife wherein, to prove
    Her powers, she deigns by rule to move;
    Nor an unbecoming stain
    Is the dust that they must gain,
    Who in such contest can but fight in vain.
    Nature, o'er day and night alternate dreaming,
      Brings forth a swart child now, and now a fair:
    On thee attends, O Queen in beauty beaming,
      A better Nature, with a rule how rare!
    Bright as thyself, thine own tend all the selfsame way;
    A daughter now, and now a son; but each a child of
              Day.                                       CL.

    Deign, Queen, to this, unless we ask too much,
    A mother's, or at least grandmother's, touch.
    It is the Muse's rosy infant fine;
    Its father--who would think?--this Child of thine.
    So unrestrain'd the love of virgin Muse,
    To be a mother thus she can't refuse.
    From _him_ what grandsons round thee soon will gather,
    Who at once father is, and makes a father!        R. WI.

OF THE PRINCESS MARY.

    Grow, maiden Princess, and increase,
    Thou who with the sweet goddesses
    Thy place shalt have; O haste to be
    Thy mother's own epitome;
    And when that pair of minor flames,
    Thy princely brothers Charles and James,
    Apt in the footsteps of their sire,
    Lead on the Fates in glorious ire;
    When o'er the Bosphorus shall creep
    A thrill of dread, as rolls full deep
    The murmur of the British name,
    And with no feign'd alarm shall shame
    The Turkish Crescent--other wars,
    And such as bring sweet Peace no tears
    Shall call thee forth; and from on high
    The flashing of thy modest eye
    Shall scatter o'er adoring foes
    Thick volleys of delicious woes.
    O, when that tender bloom which now
    Plays, lately born, beneath thy brow,
    In time to come with mightier blaze
    Shall dart around its pointed rays;
    When he, the Cupid now so mild,
    No longer but a harmless child,
    Shall range in youth's imperious pride
    Thy cheeks' fair pastures far and wide,--
    O then with what unerring skill,
    Borne on proud wings, thy shafts shall kill,
    While, where thou bid'st, the honey'd blow
    Falls ceaseless midst the exulting foe!
    How many god-like breasts shall learn
    From thee with Love's rich wounds to burn!
    How often shall thy mastering darts
    Work their sweet will on princely hearts!
    For what may she not do in war,
    Whose mother's breast--with each bright star
    That rul'd her birth--to her but proves
    A storehouse of all-conquering loves?
      Hence for thy quiver, Princess Maid,
    Take what thou wilt, nor be afraid.
    A hundred Cupids be thy prize,
    From one of thy bright mother's eyes;
    A hundred graces add to these,
    And then a hundred Venuses:
    A hundred-thousand Cupids still
    Are hers; three hundred Graces will,
    With Venuses in equal store,
    Haunt that pure fount for evermore.                CL.




IN NATALES MARIAE PRINCIPIS.[126]


    Parce tuo jam, bruma ferox, o parce furori,
    Pone animos; o pacatae da spiritus aurae,
    Afflatu leniore gravem demulceat annum.
    Res certe et tempus meruit. Licet improbus Auster
    Saeviat, et rabido multum se murmure volvat;
    Imbriferis licet impatiens Notus ardeat alis;
    Hic tamen, hic certe, modo tu non, saeva, negares,
    Nec Notus impatiens jam, nec foret improbus Auster.
    Scilicet hoc decuit? dum nos tam lucida rerum
    Attollit series, adeo commune serenum
    Laetitiae vernisque animis micat alta voluptas;
    Jam torvas acies, jam squallida bella per auras
    Volvere, et hibernis annum corrumpere nimbis?
    Ah melius, quin luce novae reparata juventae
    Ipsa hodie vernaret hiems, pulchroque tumultu
    Purpureas properaret opes, effunderet omnes
    Laeta sinus, nitidumque diem fragrantibus horis
    Aeternum migrare velit, florumque beata
    Luxurie, tanta o circum cunabula surgat,
    Excipiatque novos et molliter ambiat artus.
      Quippe venit, sacris iterum vagitibus ingens
    Aula sonat, venit en roseo decus addita fratri
    Blanda soror. Tibi se brevibus, tibi porrigit ulnis,
    Magne puer, facili tibi torquet hiantia risu
    Ora; tibi molles lacrymas et nobile murmur
    Temperat, inque tuo ponit se pendula collo.
    Tale decus juncto veluti sub stemmate cum quis
    Dat sociis lucere rosis sua lilia. Talis
    Fulget honos medio cum se duo sidera mundo
    Dulcibus intexunt radiis: nec dignior olim
    Flagrabat nitidae felix consortio formae,
    Tunc cum sidereos inter pulcherrima fratres
    Erubuit primum, et Laedaeo cortice rupto
    Tyndarida explicuit tenerae nova gaudia frontis.
      Sic socium o miscete jubar, tu candide frater,
    Tuque serena soror. Sic o date gaudia patri,
    Sic matri cumque ille olim subeuntibus annis,
    Ire inter proprios magna cervice triumphos.
    Egregius volet, atque sua se discere dextra;
    Te quoque tum pleno mulcebit sidere, et alto
    Flore tui dulcesque oculos maturior ignis
    Indole divina, et radiis intinget honoris.
    Tunc o te quoties, nisi quod tu pulchrior illa,
    Esse suam Phoeben fulsus jurabit Apollo;
    Tunc o te quoties, nisi quod tu castior illa,
    Esse suam Venerem Mavors jurabit inanis.
    Felix, ah, et cui se non Mars, non aureus ipse
    Credet Apollo parem; tanta cui conjuge celsus
    In pulchros properare sinus, et carpere sacras
    Delicias oculosque tuos, tua basia solus
    Tum poterit dixisse sua; et se nectare tanto
    Dum probat esse Deum, superas contemnere mensas.

ON THE BIRTHDAY OF THE PRINCESS MARY.

    Forbear thy fury, Winter fierce, forbear;
    Lay down thy wrath, and let the tranquil air
    With inspiration mild soothe the stern year:
    This time deserves it, and occasion dear.
    The wild North-wind may rage and wildly bluster;
    The gusty South its rainy clouds may muster;
    Yet here at least, if thou but will it so,
    Neither wild North nor gusty South will blow.
    For were it seemly, when events so bright
    Exalt us, and the universal light
    Of joy and vernal pleasure thrills the soul,
    Grim lines of battling tempest-clouds should roll
    Through all the air, and drown the year with rain?
    Better old Winter should bright youth regain,
    And turn at once to Spring; with tumult sweet
    Hasten his purple stores, and joyful greet
    With all his outpour'd heart this shining Day,
    And bid its fragrant hours for ever stay;
    Making a radiant wealth of flowers abound
    Where in her cradle that sweet Child is found,
    Her tender limbs caress and softly compass round.
      She comes! Once more are heard those blessed cries
    Within the palace. See a glory rise--
    A star-like glory added to the other,
    A charming sister to a rosy brother!
    To this she stretches out her tiny arms,
    Fair Boy--for thee displays the winsome charms
    Of her sweet smiles, and checks her gentle tears,
    And coos and prattles to delight thine ears,
    Or fondly hangs upon thy neck. Such grace
    Pleases the eye, when, their stalks joined, you place
    Lilies with roses to combine their splendour.
    And then appears such lustrous glory tender,
    When in the midst of heaven, at dewy eve,
    Two stars their gentle radiance interweave.
    Nor loftier grace that beauteous union show'd
    When from her egg the fairest Helen glow'd
    Betwixt her starry brothers, and display'd
    Her tender brow with new delights array'd.
      So mix your common beam, thou brother fair
    And sister mild. Such joys your father share
    And mother dear! And when, as seasons roll,
    He moves with head erect and princely soul
    Amid his proper triumphs, and shall learn
    Himself by his own deeds, thou shalt discern
    A riper flame within thee, heavenly dower,
    And star full-orb'd shalt shine, and full-grown flower;
    While a soft beauty bathes thy lustrous eyes,
    And rays of majesty the world surprise.
      Then O how oft, but that thou art more fair,
    Will some imaginary Phoebus swear
    That thou art his own Phoebe! or again
    But that thou art more chaste, some Mars in vain
    Will swear thou art his Venus, love's soft strain!
      Ah, happy he, to whom nor Mars will dream
    Nor golden Phoebus he can equal seem,
    Who with a wife so sweet, so fair is blest,
    And all the fond affection of thy breast,
    And tender, pure endearments; who alone
    Can call thy eyes and kisses all his own;
    And while he quaffs such nectar'd wine of love,
    Feels like a god, and scorns the feasts above.    R. WI.


AD REGINAM.[127]

    Et vero jam tempus erat tibi, maxima mater,
      Dulcibus his oculis accelerare diem:
    Tempus erat, ne qua tibi basia blanda vacarent;
      Sarcina ne collo sit minus apta tuo.
    Scilicet ille tuus, timor et spes ille suorum,                  5
      Quo primum es felix pignore facta parens,
    Ille ferox iras jam nunc meditatur et enses,
      Jam patris magis est, jam magis ille suus.
    Indolis o stimulos; vix dum illi transiit infans,
      Jamque sibi impatiens arripit ille virum.                    10
    Improbus ille suis adeo negat ire sub annis:
      Jam nondum puer est, major et est puero.
    Si quis in aulaeis pictas animatus in iras
      Stat leo, quem docta cuspide lusit acus,
    Hostis, io, est; neque enim ille alium dignabitur hostem;      15
      Nempe decet tantas non minor ira manus.
    Tunc hasta gravis adversum furit; hasta bacillum est;
      Mox falsum vero vulnere pectus hiat.
    Stat leo, ceu stupeat tali bene fixus ab hoste,
      Ceu quid in his oculis vel timeat vel amet,                  20
    Tam torvum, tam dulce micant: nescire fatetur
      Mars ne sub his oculis esset, an esset amor.
    Quippe illic Mars est, sed qui bene possit amari;
      Est et amor certe, sed metuendus amor:
    Talis amor, talis Mars est ibi cernere; qualis                 25
      Seu puer hic esset, sive vir ille Deus.
    Hic tibi jam scitus succedit in oscula fratris;
      Res, ecce, in lusus non operosa tuos.
    Basia jam veniant tua quantacunque caterva;
      Jam quocunque tuus murmure ludat amor.                       30
    En, tibi materies tenera et tractabilis hic est;
      Hic ad blanditias est tibi cera satis.
    Salve infans, tot basiolis, molle argumentum,
      Maternis labiis dulce negotiolum;
    O salve; nam te nato, puer auree, natus                        35
      Et Carolo et Mariae tertius est oculus.

TO THE QUEEN.

    'Twas now the time for thee, Mother most great,
    With these sweet eyes the day to accelerate;
    Time thy soft kisses should not idle be,
    Or from fit burden thy fair neck be free.
    For he, his parents' fear and hope confest,
    With whom thou first wast made a mother blest,
    He wraths and swords designs, courageous grown;
    Now more his father's is, and more his own.
    O spurs of nature! yet an infant, see
    He catches at the man impatiently,
    The rogue declines to keep in his own years;
    Not yet a child, he more than child appears.
    If on the tapestry, with feign'd anger fraught,
    A lion stands, by skilful needle wrought,
    A foe behold; such foe to fight he deigns;
    A lesser wrath his mighty hand disdains.
    Fierce spear he brandishes; a wand his spear:
    Soon in false breast behold true wound appear.
    The lion stands, maz'd by such enemy,
    Fearing or loving something in his eye,
    So sternly, sweetly bright; nor can he tell
    Whether beneath that eye Mars or Love dwell.
    In sooth, a Mars who may be lov'd is here;
    And Love indeed, but Love deserving fear.
    Such Love, such Mars, 'tis easy here to scan;
    This god or that, as he is boy or man.
      Thy babe now comes to take the endearing place,
    A creature not beyond thy fond embrace.
    Now let thy troops of kisses have their way,
    Now let thy love with brooding murmur play;
    Here is material tractable and tender,
    Which waxen surface to soft touch shall render.
    Hail, infant! gentle subject for caresses,
    Employment sweet a mother's lips which blesses;
    O hail; for with thy birth, thou golden boy,
    Lo, to thy parents a third eye brings joy!        R. WI.

    Ut magis in mundi votis aviumque querelis
    Jam veniens solet esse dies, ubi cuspide prima
    Palpitat, et roseo lux praevia ludit ab ortu;
    Cum nec abest Phoebus, nec Eois laetus habenis
    Totus adest, volucrumque procul vaga murmura mulcet:
      Nos ita; quos nuper radiis afflavit honestis              6
    Relligiosa dies; nostrique per atria coeli--
    Sacra domus nostrum est coelum--jam luce tenella

    Attonitam penetrare domum bene possit adulto                25
    Sidere, nec dubio pia moenia mulceat ore?
      Quando erit, ut convexa suo quoque pulchra sereno
    Florescant, roseoque tremant laquearia risu?
    Quae nimium informis tanquam sibi conscia frontis
    Perpetuis jam se lustrant lacrymantia guttis?               30
      Quando erit, ut claris meliori luce fenestris
    Plurima per vitreos vivat pia pagina vultus?
      Quando erit, ut sacrum nobis celebrantibus hymnum
    Organicos facili et nunquam fallente susurro
    Nobile murmur agat nervos; pulmonis iniqui                  35

    Des magis, an capias: audi tantum esse beatus,
    Et damnum hoc lucrare tibi.
                                  Scis ipse volucres

    Fortunae sic deme rotam. Scis ipse procaces
    Divitias quam prona vagos vehat ala per Euros;
    Divitiis illas, age, deme volucribus alas,
    Facque suus nostras illis sit nidus ad aras:                50
    Remigii ut tandem pennas melioris adeptae,

THE PRAYER OF PETERHOUSE FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD [=ITS CHAPEL].

    As bids the Day a keener longing stir
    The waking world, and warblings cheerier
    To birds inspires, when comes she o'er the hills,
    As quivering dart the streaks of Morn, and thrills
    Through lattic'd sky from roseate East the light
    Presaging his approach; nor absent quite,
    Nor glorying in his slacken'd reins, the Sun
    Is present all; and birds, to music won
    By gentle touch, are murmuring far and near,--
    So we, on whom with radiance severe
    A solemn day begins to dawn; whose eye
    Now sees glide through the heavenly courts which lie,
    With portals wide--God's house is heaven, we say--
    The flame unsteady of still wavering Day
    Slenderly stealing in; the prospect nigher,
    Our hearts too labour with extreme desire,
    And throb with hopes impatient of their end.
      How love of such a work our heart doth rend!
    How long desire makes hopes in leash restrain'd
    To pant! O sweetest House, on which has rain'd
    The torrent of God's fulness. Ah, who is he,
    Ah, who--O good, O huge in charity,
    O nigh to God Himself,--Whom to descend
    On His own gracious gifts he prays--shall lend
    This sacred twilight power to drive away
    All gloom, and shake her raiment into day?
    Ah, when, thou pitifully trem'lous bloom
    Of glimmering Day, that as from bridal room
    In the Orient cam'st to kiss our altar-stone,
    And beckonest to us from a star alone,
    In yonder distance shining doubtfully,--
    Ah, when wilt thou expand to Day, and, free
    In conscious joy of thy full splendour, pour
    A flood of light, as when the Sun doth soar
    In golden mid-day, and, to full age grown,
    Shine through and through the pile, and make it own
    With awe thy sway, nor let the sacred walls
    Doubt thy embrace?
                        Blest he to whom befalls
    To see the vaulted roofs span their fair sky,
    And break in flowers, while fretted ceilings lie
    Trembling with rosy laughter; which do now,
    As wearing of their shame a conscious brow,
    Bedew their formless face with dropping tear.
    When shall it be? the window growing clear
    With better light, that many a page devout
    May live, and life from glassy face breathe out.
    Ah, when, as hymn of praise we celebrate,
    Shall solemn-breathing murmur make vibrate
    The organ's nerves with graceful ceaseless hum;
    Nor pipe of lung unjust intruding come,
    Each harsh, uncertain note for ever dumb?
      Whatever else, in fine, this Sanctuary
    May need, that right-hand bless'd and happy be,
    And be it thine! to which the Dawn shall owe
    Its day. The altar kneels to thee. Do thou
    List to her prayer, and she will thine allow;
    Stretch out thy laden hand, and doubtful live
    Whether thou dost not more receive than give;
    That thou art happy do thou only hear,
    And turn thy loss to gain in yonder sphere.
    Thou know'st what wheel makes riches fly away;
    These riches therefore here securely lay,
    Fountains of a House perennial,
    On the Petrensian rock; from Fortune shall
    Her own wheel thus be wrench'd. Thou knowest how prone
    A wing bears up unconstant riches, blown
    On vagrant, veering winds. Come, take away
    These wings from fleeting riches, make them stay
    At these our altars, and build here their nest;
    Till arm'd with wings to better flight redress'd,
    They may transport themselves to the home of rest,
    Bearing their master with them.
                                      Blest that man
    Who knowing prudently the times to scan,
    The airiness of wealth to profit brings,
    And him on Fortune's pinions deftly flings,
    And to his riches adds an eagle's wings.            S.S.

    O felix nimis illa, et nostrae nobile nomen
    Invidiae volucris, facili quae funere surgens
    Mater odora sui, nitidae nova fila juventae,
    Et festinatos peragit sibi fata per ignes.

    Tam miseris tenuata moris, saltu velut uno

    At nunc heu lentae longo in molimine vitae                    20
    Interea moritur! Dubio stant moenia vultu

A GROAN

ON OCCASION OF THE DIFFICULT PARTURITION OF THE REMAINING WORKS OF
PETERHOUSE.

    O bird too fortunate, whose glorious name
    Fills us with envy of her happy fame,
    Which by an easy death on soaring wing,
    Sweet mother of herself, doth upwards spring,
    Assumes afresh her shining youth's attire,
    And wins new lease of life through hasten'd fire!
    She--not through slow-revolving natal days
    To a thin shadow worn by sad delays--
    Transports herself into another round
    Of centuries, as by a single bound;
    With beauteous leaves her head she covers o'er,
    And with a rosy birth shoots forth once more.
    Soon as she climbs the spicy funeral pyre
    Joyful she drinks the sun, and mounting higher,
    Now, now the ground her wings victorious strike,
    And her own ashes.
                          But, alas, we follow
    No such example. 'Neath her own Apollo,
    Our Mother Peterhouse, now ancient grown,
    Our aged Phoenix, hither, thither blown,
    And balancing herself on doubtful air,
    Hovers with wing uncertain, seeking where
    Her relics she may lay, worn out with toils,
    As in a nest, and from the very spoils
    Of her own age renew'd, she may arise
    In perfect comeliness of face and eyes,
    As in the days of old, to mount the skies.
      But now, alas, e'en in the very throes
    Of her reviving age our Phoenix knows
    And keenly feels a sad deficiency.
    Alas, in life's long lingering effort she
    Now in the mean while dies. Of doubtful face,
    Her buildings seem in part bedeck'd with grace;
    But elsewhere, heedless of inviting calls
    To union, stand the unfinish'd brother walls.
    On unresponsive ears the summons falls;
    As stones to fellow-stones appealing turn,
    The interrupted works together mourn,
    And beg a helping hand. O, succour bring,
    Whoe'er is pious, to the parent wing
    Which shelter'd thee beneath its holy shade,
    And gave so many mother churches[130] aid
    Parental; O, be now thy help display'd.
    Whoe'er thou art, the ruin'd courts to thee
    With gaping mouths are speaking audibly.
    Thy reverend mother would thine eyes engage
    To view thy walls, dismantled long with age
    And base neglect, and ponder her gray hair.
    By the full breasts which once she offer'd thee,
    By the dry breasts which she is doom'd to see
    Now for herself, she cries imploringly:
    'My age to help, O fail not to appear;
    So may long-lasting youth thy bosom cheer,
    Youth which complaining age shall never fear.'    R. WI.

A LAMENT

OVER THE SLOW RESTORATION OF PETERHOUSE-COLLEGE BUILDINGS.

    O Phoenix, all-too-happy bird,
    Who enviless thy fame has heard?
    Thou, thine own mother, from the pyre--
    Spices mix'd with flickering fire--
    Sweetly didst thy breath suspire;
    Then rose again, and thy age gone
    In a swift resurrection--
    Gone! by wondrous mystic skill
    Wearing a richer plumage still,
    Youth renew'd from feet to bill,--
    Thou didst not linger in thine age,
    Nor a slow weary struggle wage,
    With changing cures and long delay
    Searching for life in every way.
    No; but a quick fate self-choosing,
    All hindering self-ruth refusing,
    Thou didst raise thy funeral pyre,
    Thou didst hovering i' the fire,
    From amidst the perfum'd flame
    Spring up, immortal as thy fame.
    Thou didst lift thy comely head,
    Ev'ry moulting feather shed;
    Thou didst raise thy radiant breast
    Blazing to the blazing West.
    O Phoenix, thou'rt an awful bird;
    Who enviless thy fame has heard?
    Climbing to thy funeral pyre,
    Climbing self-martyr'd to the fire,
    Sweetly there to bear thine ire;
    Fetching down from the great sun
    To piled nest of cinnamon
    Rays intense; then upward winging,
    Sudden from thine ashes springing;
    Victorious by this quaint mewing,
    Life strangely out of death renewing;
    Now i' the red fire consuming,
    Next at the sun thine eyes reluming.
      Alas, how different is the fate
    In this our later age, ingrate,
    Of her, my mother-college, lying
    All desolate and slowly dying;
    Lifting but a feeble wing,
    Though once, as Phoenix of the fire,
    Springing immortal from its pyre;
    When Apollo and the Graces
    Reign'd where Ruin now defaces,
    Gave her, when she shone in splendour,
    Orator, sage, and poet tender;
    Gave her sons, noble and good,
    Better than the bluest blood:
    O how chang'd, since those days olden
    Such as in the ages golden,
    I behold her, smitten, lorn,
    And by every Fury torn,
    Hanging in uncertain strife
    As it were 'twixt death and life;
    Doubting whether e'en she shall
    Have so much as funeral;
    Her corpse laid in some quiet bay,
    Where the sea-waves softly play;
    Willing they should take her bones--
    Her time-stain'd, rent, and shatter'd stones;
    If only thus but once again
    Rebuilded, she might yet attain
    To something of her old renown
    By such resurrection,
    And, phoenix-like, herself out-do
    In her best days when she was new.
    O ye sons, your mother own
    In her desolation;
    Own her, though in aging years
    She shows few and thin gray hairs,
    Where once,--ah--in brave times of old--
    Flash'd her proud locks with sheen of gold.
    Ah, Peter nam'd, thou art denied,
    Thus is thy name verified.
    'Tis a spectacle for tears;
    'Tis a spectacle for fears;
    'Tis a spectacle for wonder;
    'Tis a crime deserves the thunder,
    That from base to gold-touch'd ceiling
    Day by day her halls are reeling;
    Mullion'd window torn and rent,
    And destruction imminent;
    Everywhere such gaping wounds
    As a stranger e'en astounds;
    And what was in faith begun
    Left in desolation;
    Stone to stone in mute appealing,
    Cold neglect and scorn revealing,
    And the font of tears unsealing.
    Sons of my Mother-College lying
    All in ruins and slow dying,
    If ye have aught of piety
    Or least touch of charity,
    Look on these broken walls, and see
    Your mother in her misery;
    Holding up, in vain appealing,
    Wither'd hands, her woes revealing;
    And in the rank growths tangled there
    See her dishonoured gray hair.
      Woe is me, her genial breast,
    Which so many sons has blest,
    Each all welcoming that came,
    Drawn by her renowned name,
    Wither'd, shrunk, can quench no thirst,
    Ah, my heart with grief will burst.
    To my dim eye there rises clear
    The full tide that once roll'd here;
    Now shingle, sand, and fest'ring mud
    Tell of the far-refluent flood.
      O, pity her, ye sons, and vow
    Once more to crown your mother's brow;
    Once more to rear her crumbling walls;
    Once more to gather in her halls
    The young, the brave, the true, the good,
    The wise, the noble; and the Rood
    Over all shall bless and keep;
    So in old age ye shall not weep,
    Nor ever shall your fair fame sleep.                  G.

    A fourth time now our glebe for Ceres bears
    The golden locks of harvest; Bacchus wears
    Now the fourth season his bright vine-leaf crown,
    Since, scant'ly hoar as yet with the soft down
    Of her first plumage, in thy gentle breast
    My young Muse dar'd to build herself a nest.
    Here found she sun and shade and gentler heaven,
    And what with these is by the Muses given
    Were hers. Here sat she careless how the skies
    Might darken, or the blasts of winter rise;
    And here her voice reach'd thee, but by what move
    Of fate I know not, only that thy love
    Her voice did win; and now at length behold--
    And ah, how much the child her arms enfold
    Is like the mother!--she in tender years
    The parent of a tender babe appears.
    What lap, then, for this infant shall I find
    Fitter than thine, or known by me so kind?
    Yea, soon as she could speak, the wanton, she
    Said, 'He shall be my guardian,' meaning thee;
    And no ill forecast I would deem is this
    Of Genius true and favouring deities,
    That she so early should a sire divine
    Always so open, always so benign.
    Take, then, thine own--she is beneath thy wing--
    And of this gift accept the offering.
    So may Persuasion, who her fount has made
    Upon thy lips, still pour from thence unstay'd
    Her sacred honey; so be at the Court,
    Whereto with plausive wreaths she doth resort,
    No ears thy Siren move not; so, I pray,
    No hindering bar thy Tagus strive to stay,
    Or only such as erst thy stream has swept away.      CL.

    Stood firm; his fortune equal to his fame.

TRANSLATION.

EPITAPH FOR WILLIAM HARRIS.

    Stay thee a short space here, good passer-by,
                            Upon thy way;
    Wherein a little while thou too must lie,
                            Haste as thou may.
    Certes thou knowest that thy life-long quest
    Leads hither--to the long, long sleep and rest:
    Grudge thee not, then, the tribute of a tear,
    Whilst, ling'ring, to this stone thou drawest near.
                  It will reward thy stay,
                It will thy tears repay,
                        To know
                        Below
                        lies
                        William,
                Of the family of Harris,
                The most splendid name
                Where all have fame.
    Knowing that such an one did live,
      And how he liv'd--great, noble, wise--
    Know how all mortal hopes are fugitive;
      Height gauging depth with 'Here he lies.'
               { As infant     Essex     }
          Whom { As youth      Cambridge } saw.
    Ah, miserable and lamenting both, that they
    See not his golden locks in years grow gray!
                            He was
                  A student of Christ College,
                  A fellow of Pembroke Hall:
                          To have him
    The two Colleges did strive
                    In rivalry of love:
    But the great God put in His negative,
                    Calling him Above,
                To gain ampler knowledge
                In the Heavenly College,
    Of which he was on earth a student consecrate;
    So, when Death summon'd him, he went elate.
                So wise his wit,
                By genius lit,
                In himself alone
                Many in one,
            You had a College, where
            Graces and Muses fair
            With Religion, you might see
            Twin'd hand in hand in amity.

          { Eloquence as an   Orator      }
          { Poetry as a       Poet        }
    Whom  { Each as a         Philosopher } owned:
          { All as a          Christian   }

          { By faith the      world       }
          { By hope           Heaven      }
      Who { By love his       fellow-men  } conquered;
          { By himself        himself     }

                      Of whom
    The ripen'd mind under a youthful face;
    Severest virtue under courtliest grace;
    Few years his, yet mellow'd as in age;
    A modesty that did all hearts engage:
    These self-reveal'd and self-revealing,
    That all his life seem'd but a fine concealing.

      Yea, ev'n in his death 'twas so;
      For being thus at length laid low,
      He chose no boastful tomb to tell
      How good the life that in him fell:
        By so much greater is the guest,
        Smaller the mound where he doth rest:
        Yea, in his death there was diminution:
      Great was the guest, but see how small the stone.
      On that very day he died in which the
      Church of England reads its even-song:
      He was snatch'd away, lest the wickedness
    of the times should contaminate his understanding,
                viz. 15th October A.S. 1631.[135]

TRANSLATION.

    Stranger, bend here thine eyes, but dim with tears;
    Whom weeping blinds, best reader here appears.
    Art, Nature, Beauty, Virtue, all agree,
    Contending late with a warm rivalry,
    To show what in one youth all join'd would be.
    So great the strife they caus'd on earth of late,
    That here from heaven itself the Judge they wait.  R. WI.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] Crashaw's version is inadvertently inserted here instead of at p.
201. G.

[2] See p. 261 (ll. 13-14 of the Poem) for the subject of the above
vivid illustration of the captive Bird, by Mrs. Blackburn, as before,
specially for us (in 4to).

[3] Not to be confounded with Handsworth in Staffordshire, or Hensworth
near Doncaster.

[4] In his Will (as before) he leaves 'to my aunt Rowthe my owne works.'
She was Dorothy, daughter of John Eyre, of Laughton, co. York.

[5] Mr. Hunter cannot have gone about his inquiries at Handsworth with
his usual persistence, for he says (as _supra_), 'I conjecture that he
may have been born about 1575, but I do not remember of his baptism in
my extracts from the Parish Register of Hansworth, nor indeed any notice
of the name of Crashaw,' &c. The Register, as shown above, abounds in
the name of Crashaw. For the 'conjecture' of 1575 it is gratifying to be
able to substitute the baptism-record in 1572. Later, indeed, Mr. Hunter
discovered his mistake. It is not very creditable to the Rev. Dr. Gatty
that in his edition of Hunter's 'Hallamshire'--a district which includes
Handsworth--he has left the interesting facts laid to his hand unused.
Surely it was worth while to claim Crashaw as sprung of Handsworth.

[6] I have very specially to thank Dr. Henry Hunter, of Taunton, the
Rector of Handsworth (Rev. John Hand, M.A.), and Mr. Henry Cadman, of
Ballifield Hall, for continued help in these local searches and
recoveries. Dugdale's 'Visitation of Yorkshire' (under Strafford and
Tickhill Wapentake) has other Crashaws.

[7] His Will, as before.

[8] Communicated by W. Aldis Wright, Esq. M.A., as before. The remainder
of the note refers to after-matters not necessary to be recorded here.

[9] Communicated to me by Professor Mayor, of Cambridge.

[10] On Alvey, see Brook's Puritans, ii. 85-6.

[11] From the 'Honovr of Vertve' we also learn that Usher had baptised
our Richard; another very interesting fact. We give the opening words,
after the monumental inscription: 'The Funerall Sermon was made by
Doctor Vsher of Ireland, then in England, and now Lord Bishop of Meath,
in Ireland. It was her owne earnest request to him, that he would preach
at the baptisme of her sonne, as he had eight yeares afore, being then
also in England, at the baptisme _of her husband's elder sonne_. Now
because it proued to be both the baptisme of the sonne and buriall of
the mother, as she often said it would, he therefore spake out of this
text, 1 Sam. iv. 2.' It will be noticed that 'eight years' from 1620
take us back to 1612-13, our Crashaw's birth-year. I add farther this on
Mrs. Crashaw: 'Being yong, faire, comely, brought vp as a gentlewoman,
in musick, dancing, and like to be of great estate, and therefore much
sought after by yong gallants and rich heires, and good joinctures
offered, yet she chose a Divine twise her owne age.'

[12] The longest poem is anonymous. It commences with a curious
enumeration of popular 'omens' supposed to precede death or misfortune.
The lines onward put some of the sweet commonplaces of our Literature
very well:

    'Her time was short, the longer is her rest;
    God takes them soonest whom He loveth best;
    For he that's borne to-day and dyes to-morrow
    Looseth some dayes of ioy, but yeares of sorrow.'

A fragment of it is in the Dr. Farmer Chetham MS. (as edited by us).

[13] The title-page of the 'Iesvites' Gospell,' is extremely
disingenuous, as there is no hint whatever of a prior publication, and
the wording indeed is such as to make it seem that the Author, though
dead well-nigh a quarter of a century at the time, was still living; for
it thus runs: 'By W.C. And now presented to the Honourable the House of
Commons in Parliament Assembled' (1641). Crashaw senior was
Ultra-Protestant, but he is made insulting and offensive beyond his
intention, as his own title-pages show. Any title-page after 1626 was
not his.

[14] Robert Dixon, gent., proved the Will on 16th October 1626, and
power was reserved for farther proof by Richard Crashaw, who, as under
age, could not then act. Except that young Richard is named executor,
there is no special provision made for him; and we must assume that as
only son and child he necessarily inherited his portion over and above
the (considerable) legacies. It was no uncommon thing at the period to
name one young as Master Richard an executor; there are instances even
of an unborn child being nominated.

[15] Yet is it notable that the elder Crashaw instituted 'a daily
Morning Exercise'--reckoned High-churchly then and since. The 'Honour of
Vertue' records that 'many hundred poore soules' had to bless God for
the 'Exercise.'

[16] Thomas Baker's note in W. Crashaw's 'Romish Forgeries' (as partly
quoted before) is utterly mistaken and misdirectedly strong: 'Erat ille
[the elder Crashaw] acerrimus Propugnator Religionis Reformatae, quam
Filius ejus Ric. Crashaw, injuriis vexatus, pressus inopia, Patria
extorris, et complexu Matris Ecclesiae avulsus, abjuravit.'

[17] The passage occurs in his Sermon before 'Lord Lawarre' on setting
out for Virginia (see its title-page _ante_). After disposing of (1) the
divels, (2) the Papists, he comes, as follows, to (3) the Plaiers. 'As
for the Plaiers: (pardon me, right honourable and beloued, for wronging
this place and your patience with so base a subject), they play with
Princes and Potentates, Magistrates and Ministers, nay with God and
Religion and all holy things: nothing that is good, excellent, or holy
can escape them: how then can this action? But this may suffice, that
they are Players: they abuse Virginia, but they are Players: they
disgrace it; true, but they are but Players, and they haue played with
better things, and such as for which, if they speedily repent not, I
dare say, vengeance waites for them. But let them play on; they make men
laugh on earth, but "Hee that sits in heaven laughes them to scorne;"
because like the flie, they so long play with the candle, till first it
singe their wings, and at last burnes them altogether. But why are the
Players enemies to this Plantation and doe abuse it? I will tell you the
causes. First, for that they are so multiplied here, that one cannot
liue by another, and they see that wee send of all trades to Virginia,
but wee send no Players, which if wee would doe, they that remaine would
gaine the more at home. Secondly, as the diuell hates vs because wee
purpose not to suffer Heathens, and the Pope because wee have vowed to
tolerate no Papists, so doe the Players, because wee resolue to suffer
no idle persons in Virginia; which course, if it were taken in England,
they know they might turne to new occupations' [sheet H 3, unpaged]. The
'Talk' in Selden's 'Table-Talk' is as follows: 'I never converted but
two; the one was Mr. Crashaw, from writing against Plays, by telling him
a way how to understand that place [of putting on women's apparel],
which has nothing to do in the business [as neither has it]--that the
Fathers speak against Plays in their time with reason enough, for they
had real idolatries mixed with their Plays, having three altars
perpetually upon the stage' ('Poetry,' Sec, 3). In confirmation farther
of our correction of a long-continued error, I find the elder Crashaw
in another of his sermons touching incidentally on the very point of
'women's apparel,' as follows: 'The ungodly playes and enterludes so
rife in this nation: what are they but a bastard of Babylon, a daughter
of error and confusion, a hellish device (the divel's own recreation to
mock at holy things), by him delivered to the heathen, from them to the
Papists, and from them to us?... They know all this, _and that God
accounts it abomination for a man to put on woman's apparel_, and that
the ancient Fathers expounded that place against them' (Sermon preached
at the Crosse, Feb. 14, 1607 ... justified by the Author ... 1609, 4to,
p. 169). Probably the preacher intimated his intention to pursue his
condemnation farther, and so the great Scholar put him right on the
well-known text.

[18] See Professor Mayor's 'Nicholas Ferrar' (1855), pp. vi. vii. 330.
He has satisfied us that Crashaw was not the author of the Epitaph on
Nicholas Ferrar, as Sancroft supposed. See p. 144.

[19] His reading included Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish. His
'exercises' were 'Poetry, Drawing, Limming, Graving' ('exercises of his
curious invention and sudden fancy'). See our vol. i. p. xlvii.

1648-9 edition of Dr. Carier's 'Missive to his Majesty of Great Britain
... containing the Motives of his Conversion to Catholike
Religion'--thus: 'Mr. Richard Crashaw, Master of Arts of Peterhouse,
Cambridge, now Secretary to a Cardinall in Rome, well known in England
for his excellent and ingenious Poems.' The Countess of Denbigh is also
in the list.

[22] In its place (vol. i. p. 234) an Epitaph is headed 'Vpon Doctor
Brooke.' This may possibly have been Brook of the Charterhouse; but I
had thought it the brother of Christopher Brook (or Brooke)--Dr. Samuel
Brooke, the associate of Dr. Donne, and author of a dainty little poem
on 'Tears.' I am not aware that the Master of the Charterhouse was
'Doctor.' But his name is spelled Brooks in 'Domus Carthusiana,' p. 139.
With reference to 'Priscianus' and 'Stomachus' and 'Hymn to Venus,' &c.,
two things are noticeable: (1) that earlier Crashaw was of the 'earth
earthy,' as much as any of his contemporary poets;--his 'Royal' and
other early poetry (as above) is heathenish almost--in strange and
suggestive contrast with his later, when every atom of him was
religious: (2) that he was not without humour or power of satire. It is
a man's loss to be without humour--he has a poorer nature if he be
without it; and for myself, I relish the human-ness of some of Crashaw's
earlier Verse, as distinguished from his after intensely-unearthly
spiritual Poetry.

[23] The following entry from the Admission-Book of Pembroke College
refers to Crashaw's Tournay: 'Mar. 1, 1620. Joannes Turney, Cantianus,
annos habens [blank] admissus est sizator sub custodia Mri Duncon.' In
another account of the Fellows of Pembroke by Attwood in continuation of
Bishop Wren is this: 'Joannes Tourney, Cantianus, scholaris Collegii Mro
Vaughan [_i.e._ 20 Oct. 1627] titulum obtinet eodem anno. An. 1632
Praedicator Academiae. An. 1634, Thesaurarius Junior et S. Theologiae
Baccalaureus. Thesaurarius Senior an. 1635, et Attornatus Collegii cum
Mro Vaughan in negotiis collegium quocunque modo spectantibus.'

[24] From the Admission-Book of Christ's College I get the following:
'Gulielmus Harris, Essexiensis, filius Gulielmi Equitis de Margret-Ing.
institutus in rudimentis grammaticis sub Mro Plumtrae Scholae publicae de
Brentwood Archididasculo, admissus Mar. 2, 1623, aetatis 16, sub Mro
Siddall.' The family of Harris, lords of the manor of Shenfield in the
parish of Margaret-Ing in Essex, occurs in Morant's 'Essex.' Sir William
Herrys married Frances Astley. From Attwood (as before) I glean these
farther entries: 'Gulielmus Herrys, Essexiensis, Colegii Christi
alumnus, Artium Baccalaureus; electus et ille Jan. 8, an. 1630. An. 1631
incipit in Artibus. Monitor autem illo anno, Oct. 15. Optimae spei
juvenis.' He may have died of the plague (cf. Cooper's 'Annals of
Cambridge,' iii. 243). (From Mr. Wright, as before.)

[25] Stanynough has also verses in the Univ. Collections of 1625 and
1633. He was buried in Queen's College Chapel, 5 March 1634-5 (St. Bot.
Regr.). I do not deem it necessary to record the college entries
concerning him, from his admission as pensioner, 30 April 1622, to
'leave to forbear to take orders,' Sept. 1631: renewed 22 July 1633.

[26] The whole Sec,, pp. 34-37, is full of anecdote and of rare interest,
and sorrowfully confirmatory of Crashaw's words.

[27] I find I cannot spare room for Cowley's own separate poem on Hope.
It is in all the editions of his Poems.

[28] Bishop Laud, in his Defence, pleads that he had retained many in
the Church of England, and names the Duke of Buckingham, spite of his
mother's and sister's influence (Works, _s.n._). Buckingham's mother was
a fervent Catholic, and here his 'sister,' _i.e._ Susan first Countess
of Denbigh, is placed with her as Roman Catholic. Other references go to
make the fact certain. I hope to be called on hereafter to give details
(as _supra_).

[29] The poems entitled 'Prayer: an Ode which was prefixed to a little
prayer-book given to a young gentlewoman,' and 'To the same Party:
covncel concerning her choise' (vol. i. pp. 128-137), have much of the
sentiment and turn of wording of the Verse-Letters to the Countess of
Denbigh; but I have failed to discover who is designated by their 'M.R.'
It is clear she was a 'gentle'-born Lady. 'Mrs.' does not necessarily
designate a married person. She may have been a 'fair young Lady.'

[30] The 'Epiphanie' has some of the grandest things of Crashaw, and
things so original in the thought and wording as not easily to be
paralleled in other Poets: _e.g._ '_Dread Sweet_' (l. 236), and the
superb 'Something a _brighter shadow_, Sweet, of thee' (l. 250). The
most Crashaw-like of early 'Epiphany' or Christmas Hymns is that of
Bishop Jeremy Taylor, from which I take these lines:

    'Awake, my soul, and come away!
          Put on thy best array;
          Least if thou longer stay,
    Thou lose some minitts of so blest a day.
          Goe run,
    And bid good-morrow to the sun;
    Welcome his safe return
          To Capricorn;
    And that great Morne
    Wherein a God was borne,
    Whose story none can tell,
    But He whose every word's a miracle.'

  (Our ed. of Bp. Taylor's Poems, pp. 22-3.)

_En passant_, since our edition of Bishop Taylor's Poems was issued we
have discovered that a 'Christmas Anthem or Carol by T.P.,' which
appeared in James Clifford's 'Divine Services and Anthems' (1663), is
Bishop Taylor's Hymn. This we learn from 'The Musical Times,' Feb. 1st,
1871, in a paper on Clifford's book. Criticising the words as by an
unknown T.P.--ignorant that he was really criticising Bp. Jeremy
Taylor--the (I suppose) learned Writer thus appreciatively writes of the
grand Hymn and these passionate yearning words: 'Who, for instance,
could seriously sing in church such stuff as the following Christmas
Anthem or Carol, by T.P.? which Mr. William Childe (not yet made Doctor)
had set to music.' Ahem! And so on, in stone-eyed, stone-eared
stupidity.--Of modern celebrations I name as worthy of higher
recognition than it has received the following 'Hymn to the Week above
every Week,' by Thomas H. Gill; Lon., Mudie, 1844 (pp. 24). There is no
little of the rich quaint matter and manner of our elder Singers in this
fine Poem.

[31] Cf. vol. i. p. 143.

[32] Like Macaulay in his History of England (1st edition), Dr.
Macdonald by an oversight speaks of Crashaw as 'expelled from _Oxford_,'
instead of Cambridge (cf. our vol. i. p. 32).

[33] The Letter of Pope to Mr. Henry Cromwell is in all the editions of
his Correspondence. Willmott (as before) also gives it _in extenso_. Of
The Weeper Pope says: 'To confirm what I have said, you need but look
into his first poem of The Weeper, where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21st
stanzas are as sublimely dull as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th,
and 23d stanzas of the same copy are soft and pleasing. And if these
last want anything, it is an easier and more unaffected expression. The
remaining thoughts in that poem might have been spared, being either but
repetitions, or very trivial and mean. And by this example one may guess
at all the rest to be like this; a mixture of tender gentle thoughts and
suitable expressions, of forced and inextricable conceits, and of
needless fillers-up of the rest,' &c. &c. 'Sweet' is the loftiest
epithet Pope uses for Crashaw, and that in the knowledge of the
'Suspicion of Herod.' In The Weeper he passes some of the very finest
things. In his Abelard and Eloisa he incorporates felicities from
Crashaw's 'Alexias' within inverted commas; but elsewhere is not very
careful to mark indebtedness.

[34] He also quotes, as complete in themselves and 'best alone,' these
two lines from No. LI.:

    'This new guest to her eyes new laws hath given;
    Twas once _look up_, 'tis now look down to heaven.'

Dr. Robert Wilde in his Epitaph upon E.T. has the same idea, and puts it
quaintly:

    'Reader, didst thou but know what sacred dust
    Thou tread'st upon, thou'dst judge thyself unjust
    Shouldst thou neglect a shower of tears to pay,
    To wash the sin of thy own feet away.
    That actor in the play, who, looking down
    When he should cry 'O heaven!' was thought a clown
    And guilty of a solecism, might have
    Applause for such an action o'er this grave.
    Here lies a piece of Heaven; and Heaven one day
    Will send the best in heaven to fetch't away.'

  (Hunt's edition, p. 30.)

[35] The 'conceit' is found in Vida's Christiad, lib. ii. 431, iii. 984:
also in a Hymn of St. Ambrose. Cf. too Psalm lxvii. 16. Victor Hugo has
adapted it as follows: 'Here is a whimsical explanation of the miracle
of the wedding at Cana in Galilee:

    La nymphe de ces eaux apercut Jesus-Christ,
    Et son pudique front de rougeur se couvrit.'

    The nymph of these waters perceived Jesus Christ,
    And her modest brow was dyed with shame.

(Victor Hugo: a Life, 1863, i. 269). Whence the brilliant Frenchman
fetched his 'whimsical explanation' is not doubtful. In the last line of
Crashaw's epigram the reading in Poemata Anglorum Latina is

    'Vidit et erubuit nympha pudica Deum.'

'Lympha' is inferior, and a (mis)reading for 'nympha.'

[36] From _Prolusiones_ of Strada.

[37] Gifford here has one of his many singular notes, because he could
think of no other meaning than 'merriment' for 'mirth,' which, as 'joy'
or 'gladness,' is quite in place, and indeed accurately descriptive of
the combined gladness and sadness of the pathetic contest.

[38] Professor M'Carthy, who finds the influence of Crashaw in Shelley,
has suggested one line from the 'Suspicion' as a motto for Hood's 'Song
of the Shirt,' viz. in st. xliii.

    'They prick a bleeding heart at every stitch.'

(N. and Q. 2d S. v. 449-52.)

[39] I place here a copy of the document that had gone astray (Vol.
I. p. xxxv.): 'It results from a Papal Bull dated 24th April 1649,
that Richard Crashaw, an Englishman, was admitted to a benefice
('Beneficiato') of the Basilica-Church of our Lady of Loreto, through
strong interest in his favour by Cardinal Pallotta, then Protector of
the so-called Holy House of Loreto, and in whose service Richard Crashaw
was. But as it appears from another Bull dated 25th August 1649, that a
successor was named to Richard Crashaw, it is evident that he was a
Beneficiary in Loreto for only about three months--too short a time to
furnish sufficient materials for the illustration of his
biography.--N.B. A Beneficiary in ecclesiastical hierarchy is a grade
under a Canon, and his duty in church is more assiduous than that of the
Canon; but it is not necessary to be a Beneficiary before becoming a
Canon.'

[116] See notice of Dr. Mansell in note to the translation. The present
poem is printed by Mr. Searle in his 'History of the Queen's College
&c.' 1871, pp. 448-9. G.

[117] 'John Mansel or Mansell was of the county of Lincoln, and was
entered at the college (Queen's) as a sizar 29th March 1594, under
Clement Smith, nephew of Sir Thomas Smith. He was B.A. 1597-8, was made
scholar in 1598, and elected fellow of the college 31st June 1600.
Romney and Bilsington, priories in Kent, were founded in 1257 by John
Maunsell, provost of Beverley, treasurer of York, rector of Maidstone,
Kent, and of Wigan, Lancashire; he was also Chief-justice of England. "I
have seen a pedigree of the Mansels, from Philip de Mansel, who came in
with the Conqueror, untill our times. Of this name and familie is that
orthodoxall sound Divine and worthy Master of Queen's Colledge in
Cambridge, _John Mansel_, Doctor of Divinitie, and a generall schollare
in all good literature." (Weever, _Fun. Mon._ 273-4.) He commenced M.A.
in 1601, and was B.D. in 1609. From the year 1604 to the year 1617 he
seems to have been in residence, as he held various college offices and
college lectureships in every year of that period. He was senior bursar
for the two years 1609-10 and 1610-11. He was vicar of Hockington from
2d September 1614 to May 1616. He vacated his fellowship in the course
of the year 1616-17, receiving his stipend for three and half weeks in
the third quarter, so that he ceased to be fellow towards the end of
July 1617. He became D.D. in 1622. He was elected president [of Queen's
College] 29th April 1622.... Dr. Mansel died 7th October 1631.' (From
Mr. Searle's 'History of the Queen's College &c.,' as before, pp.
447-8.) Agreeably to the heading, Dr. Samuel Brooke died September 1631
(MS. Baker xxvi. 167; Wood's Fasti (Bliss), pt. i. p. 400. Crashaw
celebrated Brooke, as did Dr. Donne. See English Poems in vol. i., and

[118] See notice of Heath in note to the translation. G.

[119] 'Lord' is titular, not of the peerage. Doubtless Crashaw
celebrates Sir Robert Heath, Kt., who was successively Recorder of
London, Solicitor-General, Attorney-General, and finally, 26th October
1631, Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas. From this post he appears to
have been dismissed three years later; but in 1641 he was appointed a
Judge of the King's Bench, and in 1643 Chief-Justice of that court, when
he would be commonly called '_Lord_ Chief-Justice of England.' Being a
Royalist, he fled into France in 1646, and died at Calais 30th August
1649. His remains were brought to England and buried at Brasted, Kent,
in which church there is a fine monument. His age was seventy-five. G.

[120] That is, from the Scotch trip of 1663. This appeared in the

Randolph, Waller, and Henry More. G.

some obscurity in the 'ad vesperas legit.' The intransitive use seems
unusual, unless it means as above = the Anglican Church performs the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
