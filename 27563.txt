[Illustration: Flowers]


Happiness is perfectly hollow unless there is a
meaning behind it, unless it tells of intention
somewhere, unless it means love.  "Eat and drink
and be merry" is not the end of it all.


[Illustration: Flowers]


Whoever, by a Christian word he speaks or by a
Christian life he lives, brings a new soul to see
the perfect life and take the perfect grace, has
poured out of his full hands a blessing on his
brother that leaves utterly out of sight any gift
that riches can bestow on poverty.

We want a faith, a truth, a grace to help us
_now_, ... and we can have it.  One who was man,
yet mightier than man, has walked the vale before
us.

Every attempt to do right has a tendency to
reveal to us more spiritual ways of doing right,
and our need of spiritual helps in doing it.

The thought of life is like that untouched line
we call the "sky," but which, when we try to
reach it, proves to be not one single line, but
an infinite depth ... stored with what strange
uses and benefactions we dare not say.

Some men's faith only makes itself visible; other
men's lightens everything within its reach.


[Illustration: Flowers]


There is positive proof in the single sunbeam of
the existence of the sun.

Strike God's iron on the anvil, see God's goods
across the counter, put God's wealth in
circulation, teach God's children in the
school,--so shall the dust of your labor build
itself into a little sanctuary where you and God
may dwell together.

Make truth your friend and guide in all your
hourly business,--truth of plan, and purpose, and
labor...  Whoever will not bow before this
monarch you have crowned, let him be rebel to you.

If you are not spiritually minded, do not wait
for mysterious light and vision.  Go and give up
your dearest sin.  Go and do what is right.  Go
and put yourself thoroughly into the power of the
holiness of duty.

All the world is an utterance of the Almighty.


[Illustration: Cherubs, flowers]


It seems so far off, that Cross of Jesus, and it
really is so near!  For it is lifted up so high
that the waves of time roll unheeded and
unmeaning at its foot.  It is the power of
perfection for us to-day.


Each high achievement is a sign and token of the
whole nature's possibility.  What a piece of the
man was for that shining moment, it is the duty
of the whole man to be always.

May we not daily tread the same paths of holiness
and sorrow, joy and love, that Christ has
trodden, and see His footsteps on them still?

Even if you have to force yourself to your
duty,--still, _do it_.  Do your duty, even if
duty be wearisome and hard, for then you are in
the place where it can become joyous and easy to
you.

We must answer for our actions; God will answer
for our powers.


[Illustration: Graveyard scene]


Some day certainly the fog shall rise, the clouds
shall scatter, and in the perfect enlightenment
of the other life the soul shall see its Lord,
and be thankful for every darkest step that we
took towards Him here.

Devotion is like the candle which Michael Angelo
used to carry stuck on his forehead in a
paste-board cap, and which kept his own shadow
from being cast upon his work when he was hewing
out his statues.

David's pilgrims, going through the vale of
misery, "use it for a well." ...  When they grew
thirsty they looked not merely farther on into
the heart of the future, but deeper down into the
bosom of the present.

The sense of evil in life does not _deny_, but
implies the noblest capacities in men.

Man must be a ray of the great sunshine under
whose touch some special flower may open, and
some special fruit fill itself with healthy and
nutritious juice, some little corner of the field
grow rich.

Any honest task is capable of being so largely
conceived that he who enters into it may see,
stretching before him, the promise of things to
do and be, that will stir his enthusiasm and
satisfy his best desires.

Your life cannot be frivolous or vulgar unless
you are frivolous or vulgar.  He who complains of
his circumstances really complains of himself,
and is his own accuser.

God is as willing that you should read your
lesson in the sunlight as in the storm.

Heaven at last will be the perfect sight of
Christ.


[Illustration: Flowers]


A life with no intention of God in it _must be_
shallow.

The thoughtful trader believes that Trade, in its
ideal, is generous and beautiful.  It is the
reality that he makes of it, by the way in which
he does it, that seems to him sordid.

Character is the divinest thing on earth.  It is
the one thing that you can put into the shop or
into the study, and be sure that the fire is
going to burn.

Never does human nature seem so glorious and so
wicked all at once as when we stand before the
cross of Jesus!  The most enthusiastic hopes, the
most profound humiliation, have found their
inspiration there.

The only way to run from God is to run to Him.
The Infinite Knowledge is also the Infinite Pity.


[Illustration: House and yard]


[Illustration: Stream and flowers]


Not simply His coming and His going, not simply
His birth, or death, but the living, total life
of Jesus is the world's salvation.  And the Book
in which His life shines orbed and distinct is
the world's treasure.

Remember we are debtors to the Good by birth, but
remember we may become debtors to the Bad by
life; and both debts--of service and
allegiance--must be paid alike.

Not merely a Voice to be heard, but a Friend to
be loved, a Shepherd to be followed, a Bread to
be eaten,--so does the Christ of the Gospels
present Himself in word and sacrament and every
presentation of His personality.

The tent-life is the true life until the building
of God, the "house not made with hands," is
reached.


[Illustration: Flowers]


The visionary is the man who has no present; the
drudge is the man who has no future.  To be saved
from being either,--that can come only by joining
a clear, sharp, solid work to large hopes and
great ambitions.

Does not the soul, finding the heart of its
suffering full of joy, forget the mere rough
outside in which that heart of joy was folded?

Ideality, magnanimity and bravery--these are what
make the heroes.  The materialist, the sceptic
and the coward--he cannot be a hero.

To believe is the true glory of existence.  To
disbelieve is to give ourselves into the power of
death, and just so far to cease from living.

It is only in poor men and in the lower things
that success increases self-conceit.  In every
high work and in men worthy of it, success is
always sure to bring humility.

Our strength is measured by our plastic power...
Bricks and mortar are mortar and bricks until the
architect can make them into something else.

A man who lives right, and is right, has more
power in his silence than another man by his
words.

Oh! believe me that no man lives at his best to
whom life is not becoming better and better,
always aware of greater and greater forces,
capable of diviner and diviner deeds and joys.


[Illustration: Sunset and pond]


God is omnipotent, and man is immortal.
Therefore be patient and work.  The end shall
certainly be joy, not sorrow.  The stone shall
roll away and the dead come forth.

Optimism is a belief in a great purpose
underlying the world for good, absolutely certain
to fulfil itself somewhere, somehow.  That must
have been what God saw when He looked upon the
world and called it "good."

A hundred men stand on the shore and say: "There
is no land beyond."  One brave and trustful man
like Columbus, believes that the complete world
is complete, and sails for a fair land beyond the
sea, and finds it.

Put your faith where it will be safe; and the
only place where a faith ever can be safe is in
the shrine of an action.


[Illustration: Flowers]


I must have some notion in general of what I am
alive for, or I cannot live rightly from hour to
hour this evening and to-morrow morning.

Give our lives room to grow to truth, and they
will grow to symmetry; give them leave to ripen,
and they will richen too.

The only real way to "prepare to meet thy God" is
to live with thy God so that to meet Him shall be
nothing strange.

It is not good for a man to devote himself to
preparation for dying.  It is preparation for
living that you need.

Our virtue should not be a deed, or a work, but a
growth--a growth like a tree's, always rising
higher from its own inward strength and sap.

The moment that the face is turned away from the
dead past, and looks toward the living future, a
new power comes.  Hope is awake, and hope is
infinite.


[Illustration: Flowers]


The gracious mercy that binds Omnipotence a
willing servant to every humble prayer!

Self-restraint and honesty and independence, if
they are the crown upon the head of a benignant
despotism, are the very lifeblood in the veins of
a self-governing republic.

To be calm and serene, and yet to be full of
energy and hope of higher things,--this comes to
him whose life aims at the absolute.

If you cannot argue, live!  Be true and pure and
lofty and devout, and He who ever seeks the souls
of men shall find His way to some of them through
you.

When a man means to be honest solely because
honesty is right, and not because honesty is
profitable, there is a perpetual and beautiful
tendency of his honesty to refine and deepen
itself.

Dependence upon God makes the independence of men
in which are liberty and courage.


[Illustration: Flowers]


[Illustration: Flowers]


There is a type of universal human life in
harmony with the best life of all the ages, in
tune with the sublimest and finest spiritual
music of the universe, which you can live in your
parlor and your shop.

No beauty is really beautiful which in any way
hinders righteousness or weakens spiritual life.

To every heart's experience comes its time of
desert-journeyings....  It eats its manna in the
wilderness.

You can know nothing which you do not reverence.
You can see nothing before which you do not veil
your eyes.

Repentance for safety, even for cleanness, is not
complete.  The true motive is that God may be
glorified in us.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
