  _To every Child-flower that Blooms
     Within the Glorious Garden
         That we Call Home
         This Little Book
               is
        Lovingly Dedicated._




FOREWORD


  A flower, a child, and a mother's heart--
  These three are never so far apart.
  A child, a flower, and a mother's love--
  This world's best gifts from the world above.

ALL children are flowers in the garden of God's love. A flower is
the mystical counterpart of a child. To the understanding heart a
child is a flower and a flower is a child. God made flowers on the day
that He made the world beautiful. Then He gave the world children to
play amid the flowers. God has implanted in the breasts of children a
natural love for flowers--and no one who keeps that love in his heart
has entirely forsaken the land of childhood.

In preparing this book the author and the artist have attempted to
show the kinship of children and flowers--and it is their hope that
the little ones into whose hands this volume comes will find herein the
proof that their knowledge of what flowers really are is true and that
their love for the friendly blossoms is returned many-fold.

To you, then, little child-flowers, this book is lovingly offered as an
expression of thankfulness to children for the joy and sweetness with
which they have filled my life.

  --ELIZABETH GORDON

  SAID CROCUS: "My! this wind is cold!
  Most wish I had not been so bold;
  Here the fields are still all brown;
  Glad I wore my eider-down."


[Illustration:]

  TRAILING ARBUTUS, you know,
  Loves to grow beneath the snow.
  Other folks would find it chilly,
  She says that's absurdly silly.


[Illustration:]

  EAGER little Daffodil
  Came too soon and got a chill;
  Jack Frost pinched her ear and said,
  "Silly child, go back to bed."


[Illustration:]

  HYACINTH, the pretty thing,
  Comes to us in early spring;
  Says she always loves to hear
  Easter bells a-ringing clear.


[Illustration:]

  LADY TULIP, stately dame,
  From across the ocean came;
  Liked this country very much,
  Although she only spoke in Dutch.


[Illustration:]

  LILY-OF-THE-VALLEY said
  She guessed she was a sleepy-head;
  But she got up and dressed for town
  In her new green tailored gown.


[Illustration:]

  PUSSY WILLOW said, "Meow!
  Wish some one would tell me how
  Other kittens get around
  And roll and frolic on the ground."


[Illustration:]

  PRIMROSE is the dearest thing--
  She loves to play out doors in spring;
  But if a little child is ill,
  She's happy on the window sill.


[Illustration:]

  GRANDFATHER Dandelion had such
    pretty hair,

  Along came a gust of wind and left his
    head quite bare;

  Young Dandelion generously offered hint
    some gold,

  To buy a cap to keep his dear old head
    from being cold.


[Illustration:]

  WIND-FLOWER on an April day,
  Came along and said she'd stay;
  Wore her furs snug as you please,
  Said she liked the nice, cool breeze.


[Illustration:]

  ANEMONES and Bluets grew,
  All the woodland pathway through;
  Came along one day together,
  Didn't mind the April weather.


[Illustration:]

  LILAC wears a purple plume,
  Scented with a sweet perfume;
  Very high-born lady she,
  Quite proud of her family tree.


[Illustration:]

  TRILLIUM said "Why, deary me,
  I'm just as freckled as can be,"
  Her cousin Tiger-Lily said,
  "Well, look at me, I'm almost red."


[Illustration:]

  PANSIES like the shaded places;
  With their little friendly faces,
  Always seem to smile and say:
  "How are all the folks to-day?"


[Illustration:]

  JOHNNIE-JUMP-UP made a bet,
  That he could pass for Violet.
  What spoiled the little rascal's game?
  The scent he used was not the same.


[Illustration:]

  LADY'S-SLIPPER in the wood,
  Said she really wished she could
  Have a pretty dress and go
  With sister to the flower show.


[Illustration:]

  MODEST little Violet
  Was her loving Mother's pet;
  Did n't care to go and play,
  Rather stay at home all day.


[Illustration:]

  COWSLIP dearly loves to romp
  Around the bottom of the swamp;
  She comes along in early spring,
  Before the grass, or anything.


[Illustration:]

  FRAGRANT little Mignonette,
  In a shower got quite wet;
  Laughed and said she did n't care--
  It looked like jewels in her hair.


[Illustration:]

  APPLE BLOSSOM is a fairy,
  Swinging in a tree so airy;
  By and by the little sprite
  Sprinkles the ground with pink and white.


[Illustration:]

  LITTLE golden-hearted Daisy
  Told the sun that she felt lazy;
  Said the earth was quite too wet,
  She thought she would n't open yet.


[Illustration:]

  LAUGHING, lucky Four-Leafed Clover
  Is a most atrocious rover;
  Does n't stay long in one place,
  Goes and never leaves a trace.


[Illustration:]

  THIRSTY little Buttercup
  Caught the dew and drank it up,
  Said cool water was so good,
  She did n't seem to care for food


[Illustration:]

  SWEET little maid Forget-Me-Not,
  She 's such a darling little tot;
  A blue-eyed child with modest ways,
  She 's never spoiled a bit by praise.


[Illustration:]

  COMMON little Garden Pink,
  Went away to school--just think!
  When she came home for vacation,
  Made them call her Rose Carnation.


[Illustration:]

  BOUNCING BETTY stood all day
  In the hedge row by the way;
  By-and-by she crept outside,
  And got so scared she nearly cried


[Illustration:]

  MORNING-GLORY thought she'd look
  Through the window at the cook;
  Did n't know 't was impolite
  To give a body such a fright.


[Illustration:]

  HONEYSUCKLE, pretty vine,
  Loved about the porch to twine.
  Thought't was just too sweet for words
  To visit with the humming-birds.


[Illustration:]

  WILD ROSE runs round everywhere,
  Likes to breathe the nice fresh air;
  Even her high-bred connection
  Cannot match her pink complexion.


[Illustration:]

  COLUMBINE's a happy sprite,
  Dances with fairies every night;
  She feeds them honey when they go,
  That's why the fairies love her so.


[Illustration:]

  CUNNING LITTLE Blue-eyed Grass,
  Smiles up at you as you pass;
  Looks as if a bit of sky,
  Had fallen down from 'way up high.


[Illustration:]

  NASTURTIUM grew so big and tall,
  He climbed up on the garden wall;
  His little sister could n't go--
  Dear child, she never seemed to grow.


[Illustration:]

  PANSY SAID she wished she knew
  What made Lark-spur look so blue;
  Larkspur smiled and said 't was only
  'Cause she felt a little lonely.


[Illustration:]

  OH, HAVE you seen the sweet Briar-Rose?
  She wears the very dearest clothes,
  A hat the sweetest ever seen,
  And dainty frock all shades of green.


[Illustration:]

  BLUEBELL softly, gently sways
  Through the long hot summer days;
  Lives where nothing else can grow,
  That 's why we all love her so.


[Illustration:]

  GERANIUM wears a scarlet gown,
  With trimmings shading into brown;
  Her cousin is a dainty sprite,
  She dresses modestly in white.


[Illustration:]

  SWEET ALYSSUM plays around
  On any little piece of ground;
  Takes up hardly any room,
  And sheds a very sweet perfume.


[Illustration:]

  SIMPLE LOOKING Blue-eyed Flax
  Helped the farmer pay his tax;
  Was busy all the season through;
  Said it was n't hard to do.


[Illustration:]

  BLEEDING HEART, against the wall,
  Told her woes to one and all.
  Live-Forever said, "Forget it;
  Life treats you the way you let it."


[Illustration:]

  SWEET PEA said she thought they might
  Give her a dress that was n't white;
  So Mother Nature chose for her
  All the colors that there were.


[Illustration:]

  SNAP-DRAGON is so very bold,
  He plays his tricks on young and old;
  Hides behind the old stone wall,
  And shoots his pop-gun at us all.


[Illustration:]

  RAGGED ROBIN on a lark
  Stole inside of Central Park;
  There they treated her so well,
  She soon looked like a city Belle


[Illustration:]

  YARROW PINK and Yarrow White,
  Stole in on the lawn one night;
  Gardener said they had no sense,
  But they did n't take offense.


[Illustration:]

  IRIS in a country garden,
  Politely said, "I beg your pardon,
  But I'm from sunny France you see
  And my real name is Fleur-de-Lis."


[Illustration:]

  PEONY'S a charming lady,
  She does n't like a spot too shady;
  Likes to live out in the light,
  Dressed in red or pink or white.


[Illustration:]

  ONCE THEY LOST sweet Babe Verbena,
  Mother said, "Oh, have you seen her?"
  But pretty soon the dear was found
  Creeping on the nice soft ground.


[Illustration:]

  DAINTY LITTLE Maidenhair
  Lost her way and did n't care;
  Played all day, the naughty child,
  With common ferns, who run quite wild.


[Illustration:]

  YOUNG Sweet William, sad to tell,
  Rang the Canterbury's Bell,
  "Just for that," his father said,
  "William, come out in the shed!"


[Illustration:]

  NAUGHTY little Four-O'Clock
  Gave her mother quite a shock;
  Stayed awake till nearly six,
  Oh, she's always up to tricks.


[Illustration:]

  IF YOU'RE very, very good
  When you 're walking in the wood,
  Twin-Flower babies you may see,
  Sheltered by some old pine tree.


[Illustration:]

  ALL THE SUMMER, Milkweed played,
  Like a dear, good little maid;
  But on a bright October day,
  She found some wings and flew away.


[Illustration:]

  CANDYTUFT and Marigold
  Live outdoors until it's cold;
  Sturdy maids with glowing faces
  Blooming in the bleakest places.


[Illustration:]

  JACK ROSE said, ambitiously,
  He would grow to be a tree;
  But his Dad said, "Better far
  Be contented as you are."

[Illustration:]

  YOUNG COCKS-COMB was so very vain,
  Hated to stay out in the rain;
  Said he would n't so much care,
  If he had other clothes to wear.


[Illustration:]

  ON THE BORDER of the wood
  All alone the Ghost-Flower stood,
  Like a moonbeam dressed in white,--
  Such a very pretty sight.


[Illustration:]

  GOLDEN-ROD, the lucky chappy,
  Grew up strong and tall and happy.
  Slept out doors, if you 'll remember,
  All those cold nights in September.

  She liked the sunshine on her head,
  Though her friends might think her foolish,
  Thought this country rather coolish.


[Illustration:]

  CORN FLOWER, Bachelor Button's sister--
  Gay young dog, he never missed her--
  Went to live with Mrs. Corn,
  So she would not be forlorn.


[Illustration:]

  CAT-TAIL, growing in the marsh,
  Thought his Mother very harsh,
  Because she wouldn't let him play
  With Blue Flag-lilies all the day.


[Illustration:]

  PRINCE'S FEATHER, straight and tall,
  Grew against the garden wall;
  Did n't care to play, said he
  Came of a royal family.


[Illustration:]

  CRIMSON RAMBLER one day said,
  He did n't like the old homestead;
  Thought he 'd travel, so he went
  Over the wall on mischief bent.


[Illustration:]

  GRANDDAD SAGE, the dear old man,
  Says it is a splendid plan
  For all young children to obey;
  Says they did so in his day.

[Illustration:]

  Covered up the place completely.


[Illustration:]

[Illustration:]

  She guessed she 'd toddle off to bed.


[Illustration:]

  NIGHTSHADE has a purple berry,
  But he is very naughty, _very;_
  Little children never should
  Play with one who isn't good.


[Illustration:]

  Bending low to get a look

  He was Irish, very humble;
  Still he was a jolly fellow,
  With his funny head all yellow.


[Illustration:]

  SIR THISTLE is a Scotchman bluff,
  His manners are a trifle rough;
  You find him everywhere you go;
  He travels on the wind, you know.


[Illustration:]

  WILD CUCUMBER said he guessed,
  He' d take a little trip out West,
  Thought he' d stay a year or two,
  And maybe he 'd see something new.

[Illustration:]

  The proper thing, and wear a queue;

  He 'd better cut his hair instead.


[Illustration:]

  About the time Thanksgiving 's here.

  And good fellow-ish as Holly?
  Makes no difference what's the weather,
  He and Christmas come together.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
