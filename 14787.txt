Worker in Brass.]

_Wednesday._--WAGNER. Vainly the Daughters of the River, representing
the floating capital of the Banks of the Rhine, cry "Woa! Woa!" The
orchestra, under the direction of Herr MAHLER, takes no notice of
them, but goes on Wagnerianly, inexorably. Thus swimmingly we reach
Walhall--where the fire-god _Loge_ has a _logement_ with very heavy
insurance. _Wotan_ and _Loge_ in search of the gold. Then we meet
the _Nibelungs_ and the _Nibelights_, all livers under a water-cure
system; and then--it's like a musical nightmare--_Alberich_ changes
himself into a toad and is towed off as a prisoner. _Fafner_ settles
_Fasolt_ by a drum-head Court Martial, so that _Fafner_ gets the
golden honey, and _Fasolt_ gets the whacks--and--please, Sir, I don't
know any more--but some of the music is running river-like and lovely,
more is puzzling, and much of it must remind Sir DRURIOLANUS of the
rum-tum-tiddy-iddy-iddy-um-bang-whack of a great Drury Pantomime.
House full; Duke and Duchess of EDINBURGH, with Princess MARIE
and Crown Prince of ROUMANIA, enjoying themselves Wagnerially and
Rou-manically.

_Saturday.--Le Prophete._ JOHN DE RESZKE not up to his usual form as
the Sporting Prophet; but his little Brother EDWARD, and Messieurs
MONTARIOL and CASTELMARY, first-rate as the three conspiring
undertakers. Madame DESCHAMPS-JEHIN, as _Fides_, very fine. "House,"
also, very fine, and large.

Dear _Mr. Punch_,--When writing to a Journal of light and leaders--or
misleaders--last Friday, I kept "a little bit up my sleeve," so to
speak, for the Brightest, Lightest, and Leadingest of all papers
yclept the one, Sir, that bears your honoured name. After quoting from
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN at Holloway (not _in_ Holloway) on June 17, 1885,
as a gentle reminder to Mr. GOSCHEN--_their_ "Mr. G."--I observed,
"Perhaps, however, there are reasons why the 'Egyptian Skeleton'
prefers to forget the speeches of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN in 1885." It struck
me that, having already an Egyptian Skeleton, we might have as its
companion a Brummagem Skeleton, which everyone can see through, and
this sketch I beg to submit to you, _pro bono publico_. Always, _Mr.
Punch_, your most obedient "subject" (artistically),

THE FETE OF FLORA.

[Illustration: First Prize--Love among the Roses.]

Were it not that the salutation were infelicitous, we should have
said, "Hail, all hail!" to the _Fete_ at the Botanical Gardens,
Regent's Park, last Wednesday. Besides, they have always an Aquarius
of the name of WATERER on the premises, whose Rhododendrons are
magnificent. So we didn't say "All hail!" and there was not a single
drop, of rain, or in the attendance, to damage a charming show which
has so often been spoilt by the drop too much that has floored many a
_Fete_ of Flora. Nothing could have been prettier. Flowers of speech
are inadequate to describe the scene. "Simply lovely!" is the best
epitome of praise.

LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.

_The Look-out, Sheepsdoor, Kent_.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,

Ascot has been too much for me! What with the excitement of racing all
day, and bezique half the night--(another sign of the times; women no
longer "play for love," but "love to play!")--to say nothing of the
constant strain on one's nerves as to what the weather was going
to do to one's gowns, I have had a severe attack of overwork, with
complicating symptoms of my old enemy, idleness!--so that, on my
return to town, my Doctor--(he's a _dear_ man, and prescribes just
what I suggest)--insisted that I should at once run down to the
Seaside to recuperate. Hence my retirement to the little fishing
village of Sheepsdoor in Kent, "far from the gadding crowd;" a most
delightfully rural and little-known resort, where we all go about in
brown canvas-shoes--(russia-leather undreamt of!)--and wear out all
our old things, utterly regardless of whether we look "_en suite_"
or not. The only precaution _I_ take is to carry in my pocket a thick
veil, which I pop on if I see anybody with evidences of "style" about
them coming my way; fortunately, this has only happened once, when
I met a certain well-known "Merry Duchess" and her charming little
daughter, who both failed to penetrate my disguise!

I am sorry that my selected horse for the Windsor June Handicap did
not run--though the word of command was given, "_Macready_!"--he was
not told to be "present!"--being presumably short of a gallop or two,
and therefore lacking "fire!" This little series of jokes is proudly
dedicated to the _Military_, and _Civilians_ are "warned off!"--which
is another turf expression. The much-needed rain has come at last,
and the Heath should be in fine condition, which was more than its
namesake at Ascot was, and all for want of a little attention--I am
told that the far end was all in lumps, which caused the "_Lover_" to
come down in his race--though that was hardly a surprise, as we know
that "the course of true love never _did_ run smooth!"

Now--dear _Mr. Punch_, if you want a few hours' fresh air, command the
special train, which I am told, is kept in readiness for you at every
London Terminus, to transport you--(not for your _country's_ good,
but _your own_)--to Sheepsdoor, Kent, where you shall receive a
hearty welcome--Lord ARTHUR is not with me, but my French maid will
_chaperon_ us--_if necessary_.

Yours devotedly,
  LADY GAY.

_Whereto a Brummagem Bard hath set these Spenserian Stanzas._

    has co-operated with the Conservative Government in order to
    maintain the Union between Great Britain and Ireland.]

  The lyon would not leave her desolate,
  But with her went along as a strong gard
  Of her chast person, and a faithfull mate
  Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard;
  And over her he kept both watch and ward,
  With the assistance of two valiant knightes,
  Prince ARTHURE, and the Red Crosse Paladin,
  A pair of brotherlie and doughtie wightes,
  Though erst had they indulged in mutual flouts and spites.

  For loe! a divelish dragon didde infest
  That region, and fair UNA strove to slay.
  Her to protect from that prodigious pest,
  The Red Crosse Knight--who lived out Midland way--
  Didde, with Prince ARTHURE, travel day by day,
  And prodded up that lyon as they strode,
  With their speare pointes, as though in jovial play,
  To holde fair UNA, who her safety owed,
  Unto the puissant beaste whereon she proudlie rode.

  Anon they heard a roaring hideous sound
  That all the ayre with terror filled wyde,
  And seemed uneath to shake the stedfast ground;
  Eftsoones that dreadful dragon they espyde,
  Where stretcht he lay upon the sunny side
  Of a great hill, himself like a great hill:
  But, all so soone as he from far descryde
  Those glistering knights banded in right good will,
  He rous'd himselfe full blyth, and hastned them untill.

  Then badd those knightes fair UNA yede aloof,
  Whiles they attacked that dragon side by side,
  And put the issue to stern battaille's proof;
  "We'll give this Big Green Bogey beans!" they cryde,
  That Red Crosse Knight of Brummagem in his pride,
  And brave Prince ARTHURE of the shining crest.
  But if victoriously their blades they plied,
  Or, baffled by the dragon, gave him beste,--
  Why, that the barde will sing _after_ the battaille's teste!

POLITICS.

(_BY A CONFUSED CITIZEN._)

  What a state we'll soon be in!
  Such a clamour, such a din,
    Raised from Kew to Dalston,
  Cork to Cromer, Wight to Wick!
  Seeking votes through thin and thick,
      GLADSBURY and SALSTONE!

  Talk and chatter, speech and cry!
  Some assert, then some deny
    In a near or far shire;
  Call each other names and laugh,
  Jeer and chuckle, joke and chaff--
      DEVONCOURT and HARSHIRE!

  Still they come and still they go;
  Up and down, and high and low,
    Many more than those four.
  Speak in Council, speak in House,
  Think not yet of golf or grouse,
      BALBERY and ROSEFOUR.

  Rush and canvass up and down,
  Village, hamlet, city, town,
    Stately street or poor lane;
  Start committees, advertise,
  Think of rousing party cries,
      CHAMBERLEY and MORLAIN!

  Such a fidget, such a fuss!
  There is no escape for us;
    We shall have it shortly.
  How I wish that both would go
  Off to Bath or Jericho,
      SALFOURLAIN, GLADCOURTLEY!

"Cave Kanem!"--"If," Dr. KANE is reported to have said at the Ulster
Appeal Meeting in St. James's Hall, last Wednesday, "If they (the
Ulster Irishmen) had to choose between arbitrary oppression and an
appeal for justice to the God of battles, he (Dr. KANE) had no more
doubt than he had about his existence, that that appeal would be made,
and that God would defend the right." With the saving clause adroitly
introduced into the last sentence, everyone, except an Atheist, will
agree; and, but for this, this speech reads as an incentive to Civil
War, intended to stir up brother against brother to fight to the
death. Such sentiments may, in the future, be remembered as marked
with "the brand of KANE."

A Difficulty.--_Mr. Dick_ was unable to keep, "King Charles the
First's head" out of his literary work. So Our OSCAR, it is said, has
been unable to keep the head of St. John the Baptist out of his play,
_Salome_, accepted by SARAH. Hence difficulty with licenser. The real
truth, we believe, is that the head, according to received tradition,
should be brought in by _Salome_ "on a charger," and SARAH protests
against this, as she is not an equestrian.

A New Songstress.--Mr. CUSINS, on Wednesday last, accompanying
SCHUMANN, RUBINSTEIN, & Co., may fairly be described as "CUSINS
German." A very successful Concert, musically notable, among many
notable things, for the _debut_ of Miss GWLADYS WOOD, who, being
vociferously encored, gave a Tyrolean Volkslied, or "VOKES' Family"
dance and song, playing the accompaniment herself. "She ought to do
well."--I quote SHAKESPEARE, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, the Musician, who
sang a _duo_ with Mme. VALDA. The Concert commenced with a "Septette
(By DESIRE)." This is a new Composer.

An Afternoon with Those who "Entertain" More than Anyone in
London.--"_Charity Begins At Home_" or rather it begins at the GERMAN
REEDS,' _after_ CORNEY GRAIN has finished his amusing "Vocal Recital."
Then it is that never-failing Charity begins, and goes as well as
ever. ALFRED REED is immensely funny, especially when disguised as a
Charity Girl. On no account miss the Grain of Chaff's capital French
version of CHEVALIER's Coster song about "_'Arry 'Awkins_." It's
lovely! Excellent entertainment for everybody at St. George's Hall.

THE HORSE-EDUCATOR.

(_A SKETCH AT SYDENHAM._)

    SCENE--_An Arena at North End of Crystal Palace.--The Arena is
    thickly covered with sawdust, and occupied solely by a light
    American waggon. There is a small steam-engine at one side,
    with an escape-pipe and valve projecting into the Circus,
    and a bundle of parti-coloured stuff is fluttering overhead
    opposite. From loose-boxes, three or four horses are examining
    these ominous preparations with apprehensive eyes. Enter
    a Portly Gentleman in a tall hat and frock-coat, who bows
    to the audience, and is but faintly applauded, owing to a
    disappointed sense that the ideal Horse-trainer would not
    tame in a tall hat. However, he merely appears to introduce
    Professor NORTON B. SMITH, who, turning out to be a slender,
    tall man, in a slouch hat, black velveteen coat, breeches, and
    riding boots, is received with enthusiasm._

_The Professor_ (_with a slight Transatlantic accent_). The first
animal On my list, Ladies and Gentlemen, is a vurry bad shyer, afraid
Of strange Objects, Fireworks, Music, Paper. Almost _anything_, in
fact. Bring out Number One, boys. (_To a tall Groom and a short one,
who rush to the loose-boxes, the short Groom falling over a drum, to
the general delight. The horse who is afraid of almost anything is
brought in, and begins to plunge at once, as though defying any_
Professor _to cure_ him.) Now, this animal is not Vicious, he's only
Nervous.

[Illustration: "The short Groom falling over a drum."]

    [_The Horse appears to resent this description of himself, and
    lashes out by way of contradiction._

_Paterfamilias, in audience_ (_who has a spoilt horse at home_). Just
what I always say about _Tartar_--it's nerves, not vice.

_His Eldest Daughter._ Shall you send him here to be cured, Father?

_Paterf._ No, my dear; quite unnecessary. When I see how it's done, I
shall able to take _Tartar_ in hand myself, I have no doubt.

_The Prof._ (_instructively_). It is natural For a Horse when
frightened at anything in Front of him, To jump Backwards, and when
frightened at anything Back of him, To jump Forwards. (_Applause, in
recognition of the accuracy and observation of this axiom._) Now I
will show you my method Of correcting this Tendency by means Of
my double Safety Rope and driving Rein, without Cruelty. Always Be
Humane, Never causing any Pain if you Possibly can Help it. Fetch that
Harness. (_The short Groom trips again, but so elaborately as to be
immediately recognised as the funny man of the performance, after
which his awkwardness ceases to entertain. The Professor shouts,
"Woa!" and, as the horse declines to accept this suggestion,
emphasises it by pulling the double rope, which, being attached to
the animals forelegs, promptly brings him on his knees, much to his
surprise and indignation_.) Never use the word "Woa!" Only when
you mean your horse To stop. Woa! (_horse down again, intensely
humiliated_.) If you mean him just To go quiet, say "Steady!" and
teach him The difference Of the words. Never afterwards Deceiving him.
(Paterf. _makes a note of this on Tartar's account._) Steady ...
Woa! (_Same business repeated; horse evidently feeling that he is the
victim of a practical joke, and depressed. Finally, Professor says
"Woa!" without pulling, and horse thinks it better to take the
hint._)

_Paterf._ Wonder where I could get that apparatus--just the thing for
_Tartar_!

_His Daughter_. But you would have to lay down such a lot of sawdust
first. And it might teach him to kneel down whenever you said "Woa!"
you know, and _that_ wouldn't do!

_Paterf._ Um! No. Never thought of that.

_Prof._ I will now introduce To his notice the Bass Drum. (_The two
Grooms dance about the horse, banging a drum and clashing cymbals, at
which he shies consumedly. Gradually he appears to realise that his
lines have fallen among lunatics, and that his wisest policy is to
humour them. He does so, even to the extent of suffering the big drum
to be beaten on his head with patient disgust._)

_The Daughter_. You might try _that_ with _Tartar_, Father. You could
have the dinner-gong, you know.

_Paterf._ (_dubiously_). H'm, I'm not at all sure that it would have
the same effect, my dear.

_Prof._ (_who has vaulted on the horse's back_). I will now make him
familiar With an umbrella. (_Opens it suddenly; horse plunges_.) Now,
Sir, this is nothing but an umbrella--vurry good one too--it isn't
going to hurt you; look at it!

    [_He waves it round the animal's head, and finally claps it
    over his eyes, the horse inspects it, and tacitly admits that
    he may have been prejudiced._

_Daughter._ It would be quite easy to do that, Father. We could hide
in the shrubbery with parasols, and jump out at him.

_Paterf._ Not while _I'm_--Well, we must see what your _Mother_ says
about that. [_Begins to wish he had come alone._

_Prof._ (_introducing another horse_). This animal is a confirmed
Kicker. We'll give him a little tinware, just to amuse him. (_Some tin
pans and bells are attached to the animal's tail, but, perceiving
that kicks are expected from him, his natural contrariness makes him
decline to make sport for Philistines in this manner._) Hang on more
tinware, boys! Some persons here may feel Disappointed that he Doesn't
kick. Remember--that is not My Fault. They can't be too vicious
to please me. (_The Horse sees his way to score, and after bearing
various trials in a spirit of Christian resignation, leaves the Arena,
consoled by the reflection that no one there got much fun out of_ him,
_at all events. A Jibber is brought in; the Professor illustrates
his patent method of teaching him to stand while being groomed, by
tying a rope to his tail, seizing the halter in one hand and the rope
in the other, and obliging the horse to perform an involuntary waltz,
after which he mounts him and continues his discourse._) Now it
occasionally happens To some riders that when they want To go down G.
Street, their horse has a sort of idea he'd like to go up E. Street,
and he generally _does_ go up it too!

_A Sister_ (_to her Brother_). ROBERT that's just like the horse _you_
rode that last time, isn't it?

    [_ROBERT doesn't answer, fervently hoping that his Sister's
    Pretty Friend has not overheard this comment._

_The Prof._ Well, the way to overcome that is just to turn the animal
round--so--several times till he gets dizzy and forgets where E.
Street is, and then he says to himself, "I guess I'd better go
wherever the gentleman wants!"

_The Sister._ ROBERT's horse turned round and round like
that--_didn't_ he, ROBERT? [ROBERT _turns rather red and grunts._

_Her Pretty Friend._ And then did he go where your brother wanted him
to?

_The Sister._ Oh yes, at last. (_ROBERT breathes more freely._) Only
without ROBERT. [_ROBERT wonders bitterly why on earth a fellow's
Sisters should try to make him out a regular muff like this._

    [_Two more horses are brought out, put in double harness
    in the light waggon, and driven round the Arena by the
    Professor. A steam whistle is let off over their heads,
    whereupon they rear and plunge, and back frantically, the
    Professor discoursing unperturbed from the waggon. After a
    few repetitions of this, the horses find the steam-whistle out
    as a brazen impostor, and become hardened sceptics from that
    moment. They despise the Comic Groom when he prances at them
    with a flag, and the performance of the Serious Man on the
    cymbals only inspires them with grave concern on his account.
    The bundle of coloured rags is let down suddenly on their
    heads, and causes them nothing but contemptuous amusement;
    crackers bang about their heels--and they pretend to be
    pleased; the Funny Groom (who is, by this time, almost
    unrecognisable with sawdust), gets on the near horse's back
    and bangs the drum on his head, but they are merely pained by
    his frivolity. Finally he throws an armful of old newspapers
    at them, and they exhibit every sign of boredom. After this,
    they are unharnessed and sent back to their boxes--a pair
    of equine Stoics who are past surprise at anything on this
    earth._]

_The Prof._ (_concluding amidst loud applause_). Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have only To say that I don't carry any horses About with me, and
that if anyone here has a vicious Or nervous animal, and likes to send
him to me, I will undertake to handle him free of all charge.

_Paterf._ I shall have _Tartar_ sent here--less trouble than trying
the methods myself--and safer.

_Prof._ And after I have treated the animal as you have seen, the
Proprietor will only have to repeat the process himself for a week or
so, and I guarantee he will have a thoroughly broke horse.

_The Daughter_. There, you see, Father, some of the taming will _have_
to be done at home!

_Paterf._ (_who doesn't quite see himself dancing about_ Tartar _with
a drum, or brandishing an umbrella on his back_). Well, TOPPIN will
take the horse over, and he'll be here and see how it's done. I can't
be bothered with it myself. I've too much to do!

_The Daughter_. I wish you would. I'm sure _Tartar_ would rather _you_
tamed him than TOPPIN!

    [_Paterf. while privately of opinion that this is not
    unlikely, sees no necessity to consider his horse's
    preferences in the matter_.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

_House of Commons, Monday, June 20_.--Black Rod got up little joke
to-night by way of relieving the weight of these mournful parting
moments. As soon as House met, word went round that, in absence of
Mr. G., and other Leaders of the Opposition, SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE
intended to take Prince ARTHUR in hand, and insist on his making clean
breast of date of Dissolution. A Royal Commission arranged in other
House. Black Rod despatched to summon Commons to assist at ceremony.
"The SAGE wants the House of Lords abolished, does he?" said Black
Rod, to his friend the White Elephant. "Very well; but before
it's done, I'll bet you 100 to 1, as JOHN MORLEY says, that I, as
representative of the Lords, will make him shut up, and pretty sharp
too. He little knows there's a Rod in pickle for him, and a Black 'un,
too."

Everything worked out as it was planned. On Motion for Third Reading
of Appropriation Bill, SAGE, in his most winning way, invited Prince
ARTHUR to name the happy day. Black Rod, getting tip, hurried across
Lobby; reached the door just as SAGE was in middle of a sentence.
"Black Rod!" roared Doorkeeper, at top of his voice. SAGE paused,
looked with troubled glance towards door, stood for a moment as if he
would resist the incursion, and catching sight of sword by Black Rod's
side, abruptly sat down amid general titter.

[Illustration: "Stopped on the threshold."]

Still winding-up business. GEORGE CURZON explained Indian Budget to
PLOWDEN, and Rev. SAM SMITH, who thought it very good. So it was,
comprehensive, lucid, here and there brightened with felicitous
touches of eloquence.

"Pity," said GRAND CROSS, when I mentioned to him the depressing
circumstances attendant upon delivery of speech; "CURZON's a clever
youth. When he's been with me a month or two, he'll brighten up
considerably. Great advantage for a young man to have such guidance,
coming into almost daily contact with a person like his present Chief.
The fact is, TOBY, I am really responsible for the state of the House
to-night. The country, England and India alike, are so satisfied
with my rule over what I may, perhaps without offence, call our dusky
Empire, that people do not think it worth while to go down to House
to hear the affair discoursed on by my Under-Secretary. Amongst
the natives in India, I'm told, I'm regarded as a sort of Fetish.
Travellers in remote regions bring home stories of finding, set up in
humble cottages, little images, more or less resembling me. GORST told
me they have a saying there, which he was good enough to translate.
His knowledge of Hindustanee is extensive, peculiar, and acquired with
remarkable rapidity. These are the lines:

  If you'd never make a loss,
  Put your money on GRAND CROSS.

A free translation, GORST says, but gives you the swing and the spirit
of the distich. Rather hard on CURZON that my popularity should spoil
his speech, but a good thing for the country."

_Business done_.--Budget brought in.

_Tuesday_.--Wonderfully good muster in Lords to-night. Every man upon
his mettle. As the MARKISS says, with that epigrammatic style that
makes him so delightful, "The first duty of a Peer is to appear."
Those Radicals been protesting that talk about necessity for
prolonging Session over week all a flam. Simply meant to make it
impossible for our delicate friend, the British Workman, to get

regularity and despatch.

[Illustration: "All over at last!"]

Appeal to patriotic feelings nobly answered; nearly a hundred Lords
in place to-night. CHELMSFORD, walking down with his umbrella, just
about to add a unit to the number; stopped on the threshold by strange
sight; looking in from room beyond the Throne, sees DENMAN standing
at Table, shaking his fist at Prime Minister. DENMAN is wearing
what CHELMSFORD, who is short-sighted, at first took to be red Cap
of Liberty. But it's nothing more dangerous than a red skull-cap,
designed to resist draughts. Needn't be red, but it is. Business
before House, Third Reading of Small Holdings Bill Occurs to DENMAN
to move its rejection; talks for ten minutes; difficulty to catch his
remarks; understood from fragmentary phrases to be extolling someone
as a luminous Statesman; seeing measure before the House is Small
Holdings Bill, noble Lords naturally conclude he's talking about
CHAPLIN. MARKISS interposes; says, "Noble Lord not speaking to Bill
before House."

It was at this moment CHELMSFORD arrived. Saw DENMAN draw himself up
to full height, shake his fist at the MARKISS, and this time at full
pitch of quivering voice cry, "Ha! ha! you wish to _cloture_ me again,
do you? I'm very much obleeged to you. I have a right to refer in a
hereditary assembly to the best man that ever stood in it."

Then noble Lords knew it couldn't have been CHAPLIN. Not yet.

_Business done_.--Still winding it up.

_Tuesday, June 28_.--Parliament prorogued and dissolved. "All over
at last," says ROSCOE, putting it in another and more original way.
Few to part where (six years ago) many met. Still some, chiefly
Metropolitan Members, remain to see the last of the old Parliament.

"Good-bye, TOBY," Prince ARTHUR says, after we've shaken hands with
the SPEAKER. "Shall see you again in August. _You_'re all right. One
of those happy fellows who are returned unopposed. As for me, I have
to fight for my seat, and my life."

"You'll come back too," I said; "but you'll be sitting on the other
side of House. What'll you do when you're in Opposition?"

"I'll go to the Opera every Wednesday night," said Prince ARTHUR, with
a gleam of joy lighting up his face.

_Business done_.--Parliament dissolved.

THE POLITICAL JOHNNY GILPIN.

    (_Lately-discovered Fragments of a Grand Old Ballad, the
    Sequel to which may--or may not--turn up later on._)

  JOHN GILPIN was a patriot
    Of credit and renown;
  A Grand Old Leader eke was he,
    Of famous London town.

  JOHN's Liberal Lady said, "Oh, dear!
    Out in the cold we've been
  These seven tedious years, and have
    No chance of Office seen.

  "To-morrow is Election Day,
    And we may then repair
  Our Party-split a little bit,--
    That is--if you take care!

  "Our Sisters, and the Labour lot,
    Need soothing, you'll agree;
  If we can all together ride,
    I think we'll have a spree."

  He soon replied, "I do admire
    Of Liberal Dames but one,
  And you are she, my dearest dear;
    Therefore it shall be done!

  "I am a Programme-rider bold,
    As all the world doth know,
  And my good friend the Party 'Whip'
    Will teach me how to go."

  Quoth the good dame, "Liquor we'll want,
    The 'Union Tap' is queer;
  We'll furnished be with our own 'Blend,'
    Scotch-Irish bright and clear."

  JOHN GILPIN kissed his partner shrewd;
    O'erjoyed was he to find
  That, though on conquest she was bent,
    She had a prudent mind.

         *       *       *       *       *

  JOHN GILPIN, at his horse's side,
    Seized fast the flowing mane,
  And up he got, in haste to ride,
    But soon came down again.

  For saddle-tree scarce reached had he,
    His journey to begin.
  When, turning round his head, he saw
    Queer customers come in.

  So down he came; for loss of time,
    Although it grieved him sore,
  Yet loss of Votes, full well he knew,
    Would trouble him much more.

  'Twas long, ere these queer customers
    Were suited to their mind,
  When SCHNADDY, shouting, came down stairs,
    "The tipple's left behind!"

  "Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
    My leathern belt likewise,
  In which I bear my trusty blade
    When foes I 'pulverise.'"

  His Liberal Lady (careful soul!)
    Had two big bottles found,
  To hold the liquor that she loved,
    And keep it safe and sound.

  Each bottle had a curling ear,
    Through which the belt he drew,
  And hung a bottle at each side,
    To keep his balance true.

  Then, over all, that he might be
    Equipped from top to toe,
  His long green cloak, well-brushed and neat,
    He manfully did throw.

  Now see him mounted once again
    Upon his docile steed,
  Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,
    With caution and good heed.

  It might have been a smoother road,
    Nor was it nice to meet
  First off, a Pig, who GILPIN bold
    With stubborn grunt did greet.

  So fair and softly! JOHNY cried,
    But--

TIP FROM OUR OWN BOOKING-OFFICE.--Persons about to go to the Country,
whether to defend their own seat or attack someone else's, can't do
better, my Baronite says, than take with them P.W. CLAYDEN's _England
Under Coalition_, just published by FISHER UNWIN. It's not much to
carry, but it's worth the trouble of packing up; also of unpacking,
and reading. It tells the story of two Parliaments and three
Governments. A pretty story it is, more interesting than most novels,
and in one volume too. A marvel of condensation and lucid narrative.
Only one thing lacking to a work likely to be constantly used for
reference, and that is an index. "But you can't have everything," as
_Queen Eleanor_ said to _Fair Rosamond_ when, having swallowed the
contents of the poisoned chalice, she asked for a dagger.

ELECTION NOTES.

(_BY MR. PUNCH'S SPECIAL COMMISSIONER._)

DEAR SIR,--I am glad you consented eventually to the terms I
proposed. After all, L100 a-week (_and expenses_) is a mere trifle
for the arduous work I expect to do for you. According to your
instructions, I arrived three nights ago in the ancient borough of
Bunkham-on-the-Marsh, and at once took steps to pursue those inquiries
which are necessary for a satisfactory estimate of the political
situation. My experience as a lightning change _artiste_ is quite
invaluable. I visit the Liberal Committee-rooms, and attend Liberal
meetings in a complete suit of corduroys and horny hands. Five minutes
afterwards I find myself in a military moustache, a frock coat,
and patent leather boots at the Conservative head-quarters. In the
former disguise I enthusiastically advocate the Newcastle Programme,
and denounce the base minions of Coercion. In the latter I rouse
Conservative partisans to frenzy by my impassioned appeals on behalf
of one Queen, one Flag, one Empire, and a policy of enlightened
Conservative progress. I can highly recommend my two perorations, in
one of which I consign Mr. GLADSTONE to eternal infamy, while in the
other I hold up Lord SALISBURY to the derision of mankind.

I send you herewith extracts from the two newspapers published in
Bunkham. The _Bunkham News_ is the organ of the Liberals; the _Bunkham
Standard_ (with which are incorporated the _Bunkham Messenger_ and the
_Bunkham Guardian and Mangelhire Express_) expresses the views of the
Conservatives in this important district.

_The Bunkham News._

At last! The period of subterfuges and evasions is past. Fraud and
dishonesty have had their day, Coercion has done its worst, and the
time has come when the most scandalous and disgraceful Government
of which history bears record, will have to submit itself for
judgment to the opinions of those who are dishonoured by being its
fellow-countrymen. We can have no doubt whatever as to what the result
of the contest will be in this enlightened constituency. The men of
Bunkham have been at all times noted for their love of freedom and
justice, and for their hatred of those who base themselves upon
oppression and iniquity. The Liberal Candidate, Mr. HENRY PLEDGER,
has now been before the Constituency for more than a year. Wherever
he has gone he has been received with unparalleled demonstrations
of enthusiasm by the immense majority of our fellow-townsmen. His
eloquence, combined with his engaging manners, have won all hearts.
The fight will be short, but severe. Men of Bunkham, will you lag in
the rear? The issue is to those who work from now to the polling day.
If you only make a united effort, triumph is assured.

       *       *       *       *       *

_The Bunkham Standard._

The date of the Dissolution has been fixed, and by making it
impossible for the Elections to be held on a Saturday, the Government
have given one more proof of their deep and sincere devotion to the
highest interests of the working-classes. There never has been any
Ministry, we make bold to say, whose record will better bear the
fierce light of public investigation. Grievances have been redressed,
moderate reforms, such as the country desired, have been passed into
law, and turbulence and outrage have been repressed. No body of
men ever deserved more fully what they now possess, and are sure to
retain--the confidence and gratitude of their fellow-citizens. Our
Member, Mr. TUFFAN, has borne a not unimportant part in assisting
the Government by his presence in the House of Commons. His manly,
straightforward integrity, and his universal generosity, have
endeared him to all classes in Bunkham. We look forward with absolute
confidence to his return by an immense majority. From the disorganised
ranks of our adversaries there is little to fear. Let us stand
shoulder to shoulder, and leave no stone unturned to win a victory
which is even now within our grasp.

       *       *       *       *       *

I have had interviews with prominent politicians on both sides,
and have been assured on both sides, that victory is certain. Both
Candidates are constantly occupied in driving all over the borough
in pair-horse carriages, lavishly decorated with the party colours,
orange for the Liberals, blue for the Conservatives. Mrs. PLEDGER is
magnificent in an orange silk dress; Mrs. TUFFAN overwhelms me with
blue ribbons. Master PLEDGER waves an orange banner in every street;
Miss TUFFAN distributes blue cards in all the shops. The Liberal
Committee-rooms are ablaze with pictures of Mr. GLADSTONE; the
Conservative Office flames with Union Jacks, and other Imperial
devices. Eight meetings are to be held in different parts of the
Constituency to-night. Immense efforts are being made to capture the
votes of the Association of Jam Dealers, which has its chief factory
here. Master PLEDGER has just gone by in a Victoria, with a huge pot
of "Bunkham Jam" on the seat in front of him. He had a spoon, and was
apparently enjoying himself. This manoeuvre has much depressed the
Conservatives, who consider it disgraceful. More next week.

Yours always, THE MAN IN THE MOON.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
