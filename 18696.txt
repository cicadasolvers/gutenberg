LITERARY CURIOSITIES.


THE following humorous lines well describe the difficulty that editors
find in pleasing the public. They are expected to know everything, and
to be able to satisfy all tastes and capacities. No imperfections can be
excused in conductors of newspapers; they are not even allowed to be
unfortunate.


               THE EDITOR.

    That editor who wills to please,
    Must humbly crawl upon his knees,
      And kiss the hand that beats him;
    Or, if he dare attempt to walk,
    Must toe the mark that others chalk,
      And cringe to all that meet him.

    Says one, Your subjects are too grave,
    Too much morality you have,--
      Too much about religion;
    Give me some witch and wizard tales
    Of slip-shod ghosts with fins and scales,
      Of feathers like a pigeon.

    I love to read, another cries,
    Those monstrous, fashionable lies,--
      In other words, those novels,
    Composed of kings and queens and lords,
    Of border wars, and gothic hordes
      That used to live in hovels.

    No, no, cries one, we've had enough
    Of such confounded love-sick stuff,
      To craze the fair creation;
    Give us some recent foreign news
    Of Russians, Turks, the Greeks, or Jews,
      Or any other nation.

    The man of dull scholastic lore
    Would like to see a little more
      In scraps of Greek or Latin;
    The merchants rather have the price
    Of southern indigo and rice,
      Of India silks, or satin.

    Another cries, I want more fun,
    A witty anecdote or pun,
      A rebus or a riddle;
    Some long for missionary news,
    And some, of worldly, carnal views,
      Would rather hear a fiddle.

    The critic, too, of classic skill,
    Must dip in gall his gander quill,
      And scrall against the paper:
    Of all the literary fools
    Bred in our colleges and schools,
      He cuts the greatest caper.

    Another cries, I want to see
    A jumbled-up variety,
      Variety in all things,--
    A miscellaneous, hodge-pod print,
    Composed (I only give the hint)
      Of multifarious small things.

    I want some marriage news, says miss:
    It constitutes my highest bliss
      To hear of weddings plenty;
    For in a time of general rain
    None suffer from a drought, 'tis plain,--
      At least, not one in twenty.

    I want to hear of deaths, says one,
    Of people totally undone
      By losses, fire, or fever:
    Another answers full as wise,
    I'd rather have a fall and rise
      Of raccoon skins and beaver.

    Some signify a secret wish
    For now and then a favorite dish
      Of politics to suit them.
    But here we rest at perfect ease,
    For should they swear the moon was cheese,
      We never should dispute them.

    Or grave or humorous, wild or tame,
    Lofty or low, 'tis all the same,
      Too haughty or too humble;
    And every editorial wight
    Has nought to do but what is right,
      And let the grumblers grumble.

In "old times" almost all the young ladies upon their marriage were
"amiable" and "agreeable"; at least they are so represented in most of
the announcements. The "maiden aunt" could not speak plainer in writing

Editors were formerly very fond of curious matter for their lists of
marriages and deaths. In the "Massachusetts Centinel" for 1789 the
marriage of Pork and Hogg has a doubtful look, although it used to be

    female beauty, with a determined resolution,

    Mr. JACK DALAND, a very worthy black man, aged 65. He was
    brought from Africa to the West Indies at about 11 years of
    age; but instead of being _eaten_, as he expected, by the
    white men, he was transferred by purchase to a happy asylum
    in this place, where he has spent upwards of 50 years of his
    life, respected by the whole town, as a faithful,
    industrious, pleasant-tempered, intelligent man. His honest
    industry was rewarded by the acquisition of a comfortable
    property, which he has left for the enjoyment of his family.
    The long train of white people who followed his remains to
    the grave, testify to the esteem in which he was held.

The following is a notice of a "distinguished merchant" and "literary"
character of Newburyport, Mass. In the appendix to "Lord" Dexter's great
production--where all the stops are placed together on the last page,
so that "people can salt and pepper as they please"--we find these
lines:

                 "All men inquire, but few can tell
                  How thou in Science doth excel!"

    TIMOTHY DEXTER. The subject of the present sketch, according
    to his own account, was born in Malden, Massachusetts. "I
    was born," says he (in his celebrated work, "A Pickle for
    the knowing ones"), "1747, Jan. 22; on this day in the
    morning, a great snow storm in the signs of the seventh
    house; whilst Mars came forward Jupiter stood by to hold the
    candle. I was to be a great man."

    Lord Dexter, after having served an apprenticeship to a
    Leather dresser, commenced business in Newburyport, where he
    married a widow who owned a house and a small piece of land,
    part of which, soon after the nuptials, were converted into
    a shop and tanyard.

    By application to his business his property increased, and
    the purchase of a large tract of land near Penobscot,
    together with an interest which he bought in the Ohio
    Company's purchase, afforded him so much profit, as to
    induce him to buy up Publick Securities at forty cents on
    the pound, which securities soon after became worth twenty
    shillings on the pound.

    His Lordship at one time shipped a large quantity of
    _warming pans_ to the _West Indies_ where they were sold at
    a great advance on prime cost, and used for molasses
    ladles. At another time, he purchased a large quantity of
    _whalebone_ for _ship's stays_; the article rose in value
    upon his hands, and he sold it to great advantage.

    Property now was no longer the object of his pursuit; but
    popularity became the god of his idolatry. He was charitable
    to the poor, gave large donations to religious societies,
    and rewarded those who wrote in his praise.

    His lordship about this time acquired his peculiar taste for
    style and splendour; and to enhance his own importance in
    the world, set up an elegant equipage, and at great cost
    adorned the front of his house with numerous figures of
    illustrious personages.

    By his order, a tomb was dug under the summer house in his
    garden, during his life; which he mentions in 'A Pickle for
    the knowing ones,' in the following ludicrous style:--

    "Heare will lie in box the first Lord in Americake the first
    Lord Dexter made by the voice of hampsher state my brave
    fellows Affirmed it they give me the titel and so Let it
    goue for as much as it will fetch it wonte give me Any
    breade but take from me the Contrary fourder I have a grand
    toume in my garding at one of the grasses and the tempel of
    Reason over the toume nand my coffen made and all Ready I
    emy house painted with white Lead an side and outside
    touched with green and bras trimmings Eight handels and a
    good Lock, I have had one mock founrel it was so solmon and
    there was so much Criing about 3000 spectators I say my
    house is Euqal to any mansion house in twelve hundred miles
    and now for sale for seven hundred pounds weight of Dollars
    by me

                                               TIMOTHY DEXTER."

    Lord Dexter believed in transmigration sometimes; at others
    he was a deist. He died on the 22d day of Oct. 1806, in the
    60th year of his age.

                               _Salem Observer,_ Dec. 17, 1825.

From what we have heard and read of Mr. Dexter, it is a matter of
surprise to us how such eccentricities could have attracted the
attention they evidently did. It is doubtful if so much folly and
conceit could now interest many people for any length of time.

Curious old almanacs.

    AN OLD ALMANACK. A friend has handed us an almanack one
    hundred and fifty years old, which is quite a curiosity in
    its line. The following is the title:

    "The New-England Almanack for the Year of our Lord MDCCIII.
    Being Third after Leap-year, and from the Creation, 5652.
    Discovery of America by Columbus, 211. Reign of our Gracious
    Queen Anne, (which began March 8, 1702,) the 2 year. Wherein
    is contained, Things necessary, and common in such a
    Composure. As the Quarters of the Moon, Aspects of the
    Planets and Weather set down Exactly according to the
    Aspects, Courts, Spring Tides, Rising and Setting of the
    Sun, Sun and Moons place, time of Full Sea at Boston, the
    Eclipses, High Ways, &c., with several other Curiosities.
    Calculated for the Meridian of Boston, the Metropolis of
    New-England, Lat. 42, 24, but may serve any part of the
    Country, (even as far as New-York,) without sensible Error.
    By Samuel Clough.

        The Heavens to us, God's Glory do make known,

    Licensed by His Excellency the Governour. Boston: Printed by
    B. Green and J. Allen, for the Booksellers, and are to be
    Sold at their Shops. 1703."

    Then follows a short address "To the Readers" of the
    Almanack. The figure of "Man's Body" with the "Twelve Signs
    of the Zodiack," is headed with the following lines:

        The Anotomy must still be in,
        Else th' Almanack's not worth a pin:
        For Country-men regard the Sign
        As though 'Twere Oracle Divine.
        But do not mind that altogether,
        Have some respect to Wind and Weather.

    The months of the year are introduced as follows:

                    _January._

    Cold Weather now 'gins to be fierce,
    And Norwest Winds our bodys pierce.

                    _February._

    The Weather still continues cold,
    Therefore warm cloaths are good we hold.

                    _March._

    'T is the best Month of all the year,
    Wherein to brew good napping Beer.

                    _April._

    Now Leaves on Trees begin to spring,
    And Birds on Hedges sit and sing.

                    _May._

    To walk Five Miles in his own Farm,
    Will do a Husbandman no harm.

                    _June._

    Now Countrymen each Sun shine day,
    Mow down their Grass, and make it hay.

                    _July._

    If Mildew now blasts English Grain,
    'Twill make poor Husbandmen complain.

                    _August._

    But if from Blasting it be free,
    The Farmers then should thankful be.

                    _September._

    The Leaves from Trees now fall away,
    And sweetest Flowers do decay.

                    _October._

    If Barns are full, though Fields be empty,
    It doth prognosticate a plenty.

                    _November._

    One day this Month each Fruitful year,
    Give thanks to GOD, and Eat good chear.

                    _December._

    The Weather now 'gins to be cold,
    Which makes to shrink both young and old.

    ANOTHER OLD ALMANACK. In our last we gave an account of an
    old Almanack for the year 1703. Since then we have seen
    another some sixteen years older, printed for the year 1687.
    It was bound in with an old account book that formerly
    belonged to the Rev. Thomas Barnard, a minister of Andover,
    from 1682 to 1718,--the great-grandfather of the Rev. Thomas
    Barnard, D.D., the first minister of the North Church in
    this city, who died Oct. 1, 1814, in the sixty-seventh year
    of his age, also an ancestor of Capt. Edward Barnard, of
    this city. We insert the title page and other extracts
    therefrom, which we trust will impart the same interest to
    our readers as we derived from its perusal.

    It is prefaced by the following:

    Novemb. 24th, 1686. I have Perused the Copy of an Almanack
    for the Ensuing Year, Composed by John Tulley, and find
    nothing in it contrary to His Majesties Laws, and therefore
    Allow it to be Printed, and Published by Benjamin Harris,
    Book-Seller in Boston.

                                         EDWARD RANDOLPH, Secr.

    The following is the title:

    Tully 1687. An Almanack for the Year of Our Lord MDCLXXXVII.
    Being the third after Leap-year, and from the Creation 5636.
    The Vulgar Notes of which are Prime 16--Epact 26--Circle of
    the [Symbol: Sun] 16--Domin: Letter B. Unto which is annexed
    a Weather Glass, whereby the Change of the Weather may be
    foreseen. Calculated for and fitted to the Meridian of
    Boston in New-England, where the North Pole is elevated 42
    gr. 30 m. By John Tulley. Boston, Printed by S. Green for
    Benjamin Harris; and are to be Sold at his Shop, by the Town
    Pump near the Change. 1687.


    Then follows "A Table of Kings," from William the Conqueror,
    1066, to James 2d, 1685, closing with the lines--

        Now may we look on Monarchy and sing,
        In health and peace long live great JAMES our King.

    And concluding with the "Weather Glass," &c., &c., which
    follow:

    _Prognostica Georgica_: Or the Country-man's Weather-Glass.

    Prognosticks of Tempests. The obscuring of the smaller stars
    is a certain sign of Tempests approaching, the oft changing
    of the Winds is always a forerunner of a storm.

    Of Winds. The resounding of the Sea upon the shore, and
    murmuring of the Winds in the Woods without apparent Wind,
    shew wind to follow; shooting of stars (as they call it) is
    an usual sign of wind from that quarter the star came from,
    Redness of the Skie in the morning is a token of Winds, or
    Rain, or both: if the circles that appear about the Sun, be
    red and broken, they portend wind: if thick and dark, Winds,
    Snow, or Rain: The like may be said of the Circles about the
    Moon.

    Of Rain. If two Rainbows appear, they are a sign of Rain: If
    the Sun or Moon look pale, look for Rain: if a dark Cloud be
    at Sun-rising, in which the Sun soon after is hid, it will
    dissolve it, and Rain will follow: if the Sun seem greater
    in the East than commonly, it is a sign of Rain, if in the
    West about Sun-setting there appear a black Cloud, you may
    expect Rain that night, or the day following, if in the
    winter time thick white Clouds appear in the South-east near
    the Horizon at Sun rising, they portend Snow, a day or two
    after: If black Clouds appear there, it is a sign of Rain.

    Of Fair Weather. If the Moon look bright and fair, look for
    Fair Weather. Also the appearing of one Rainbow after a
    storm, is a known sign of Fair Weather. If Mists come down
    from the Hills, or descend from the heavens, and settle in
    the valleys, they promise fair hot weather: Mists in the
    Evening shew a fair, hot day on the morrow: The like when
    mists rise from the waters in the evening. Much more might
    be added, but I would not tire the reader.

    It appears by the following that the first form of
    government, under the King, was accepted by the people in
    1686.

    May 14, 1686. Arrived from England, His Majesty's Commission
    to divers worthy Gentlemen, to be a President and Council
    for the management of his Majesty's Government here, and
    accordingly on the 25th of May, '86, the President and
    Council being assembled in Boston, the exemplification of
    the Judgment against the Charter of the Late Governour and
    Company of the Massachusetts-Bay in N E together with His
    Majesty's Commission of Government were publickly read, and
    received by persons of all conditions with general
    Acceptance.

    It will appear by the following advertisement that a market
    was then first appointed by authority to be kept in Boston.

    Advertisement. There is Appointed by Authority a Market to
    be kept in Boston, and a Committee is ordered to meet and
    state the place, and days, and other circumstances relating
    to the good settling thereof: Of which a more particular
    Account may be speedily expected.

    This Almanack was published only 67 years from the
    settlement at Plymouth, and 59 from that of Salem.

In the eyes of the old New England people the almanac stood next to the
Bible in importance. Almost the only knowledge we have of many events of
those early days has been obtained from diaries kept in interleaved
almanacs. It is true, important facts are often found recorded in
connection with trifling or quite unimportant matters.

The venerable Dr. Holyoke, of Salem, president of the Massachusetts
Medical Society, who died in March, 1829, at the age of one hundred
years and eight months, wrote a letter, a few months before his death,
in answer to a request that he would furnish some particulars of his
mode of living. Dr. Holyoke was through life noted for being remarkably
temperate in all things. After his death it was reported that some
physician said (perhaps in fun) that if Dr. H. had not been in the
habit of using intoxicating liquors he might have lived to a _good old
age._

We give here a copy of this interesting letter.

                             Salem.

                SATURDAY MORNING, AUGUST 1, 1829.

    DR. HOLYOKE. The Medical Society of this District have
    rendered an appropriate tribute of respect for the memory of
    their venerated associate, the late Dr. E.A. HOLYOKE, by
    publishing an elegant little volume, containing a memoir of
    the deceased, prepared by a Committee of the Society, and a
    few of his writings. We have selected from the latter the
    following articles, which will interest the reader. The
    first is an account of Dr. Holyoke's habits of life, diet,
    &c., furnished by him in a letter to one of his friends; the
    others are a historical memorandum and a fragment of the
    Doctor's poetical effusions.

    _To ---- ---- ---- Williamsville, Person County, North
    Carolina._

                                            SALEM, Oct'r--1828.

    SIR,--I received yours of the 20th ult. on ye 30th, wherein
    you wish me to give you some Account of my Mode of Life,
    &c.--In answer to which I would first mention that I was
    providentially blessed with an excellent Constitution--that
    I never injured this constitution by Intemperance of any
    kind--but invigorated it by constant Exercise, having from
    my 30th to my 80th Year walked on foot (in the Practice of
    my Profession)--probably as many as 5 or 6 miles every day,
    amounting to more than a _million_[A] of miles, and tho'
    sometimes much fatigued, the next Night's refreshing Sleep,
    always completely restored me. In early life, between 20 and
    30, I used to ride on Horse back, but being often pestered
    by my Horses slipping their Bridles I found it more
    convenient to walk.

    As to my Diet, having been taught to eat of any thing that
    was provided for me, and having always a good Appetite, I am
    never anxious about my food, and I do not recollect any
    thing, that is commonly eaten, that does not agree with my
    Stomach, except fresh roasted Pork, which tho' very
    agreeable to my Palate, almost always disagrees with me; for
    which however I have a remedy, in the Spirit of Sal Amoniac.
    Eight or Ten drops of Aqua Ammonia pura in a wine glass of
    Water, gives me relief after Pork, and indeed after anything
    else which offends my stomach. As to the Quantity, I am no
    great Eater, and I find my appetite sooner satisfied now
    than formerly;--there is one peculiarity in my Diet which as
    it may perhaps have contributed to Health I would mention; I
    am fond of Fruit, and have this 30 or more years daily
    indulged in eating freely of those of the Season, as
    Strawberries, Currants, Peaches, Plums, Apples, &c., which
    in summer and winter I eat just before Dinner, and seldom at
    any other time, and indeed very seldom eat any thing
    whatever between meals.--My Breakfast I vary continually.
    Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, with toasted bread and butter, Milk
    with Bread toasted in hot weather, but never any meat in my
    Life--seldom the same Breakfast more than 2 or 3 days
    running. Bread of Flour makes a large portion of my Food,
    perhaps near 1-2. After Dinner I most commonly drink one
    glass of Wine--plain boiled rice I am fond of--it makes
    nearly 1-2 of my Dinner perhaps as often as every other
    Day--I rarely eat Pickles or any high seasoned
    Food--Vegetable food of one kind or other makes commonly 2-3
    or 3-4 of my nourishment--the condiments I use are chiefly
    Mustard, Horse radish and Onions. As to Drinks, I seldom
    take any but at meal times and with my Pipe--in younger Life
    my most common draft was Cider, seldom Wine, seldom or never
    Beer or Ale or distilled Spirits--But for the last 40 or 50
    years, my most usual drink has been a Mixture, a little
    singular indeed, but as for me it is still palateable and
    agreeable, I still prefer it--The Mixture is this, viz. Good
    West India Rum 2 Spoonfuls, Good Cider whether new or old 3
    Spoonfuls, of Water 9 or 10 Spoonfuls--of this Mixture
    (which I suppose to be about the strength of common Cider) I
    drink about 1-2 a Pint with my Dinner and about the same
    Quantity with my Pipe after Dinner and my Pipe in the
    Evening, never exceeding a Pint the whole Day; and I desire
    nothing else except one glass of Wine immediately after
    Dinner the whole day. I generally take one Pipe after Dinner
    and another in the Evening, and hold a small piece of
    pigtail Tobacco in my mouth from Breakfast till near Dinner,
    and again in the Afternoon till tea; this has been my
    practice for 80 years--I use no Snuff--I drink tea about
    sunset and eat with it a small slice of Bread toasted with
    Butter--I never eat any thing more till Breakfast.

    I have not often had any complaint from indigestion, but
    when I have, abstinence from Breakfast or Dinner, or both,
    has usually removed it; indeed I have several times thrown
    off serious Complaints by Abstinence.--As to Clothing, it is
    what my Friends call thin; I never wear Flannel next my Skin
    tho' often advised to it, and am less liable to take cold,
    as it is called, than most people--a good warm double
    breasted Waist-Coat and a Cloth coat answers me for winter,
    and as the season grows warmer I gradually conform my
    Covering to it. As to the Passions, Sir, I need not tell you
    that when indulged, they injure the Health; that a calm,
    quiet self-possession, and a moderation in our Expectations
    and Pursuits, contribute much to our Health, as well as our
    happiness, and that Anxiety is injurious to both.

    I had a good Set of Teeth, but they failed me gradually,
    without Pain, so that by 80 I lost them all.

    Thus, Sir, you have, blundering and imperfect as it is, an
    answer to your Requests, with my best wishes that it may be
    of any service to the Purpose for which it was made--But
    must rely upon it that Nothing I have written be made public
    in my Name.[B] Wishing you long Life and many happy Days,

                           I am Yours, &c.
                                        E.A. HOLYOKE.

    P.S. I forgot to speak of my repose. When I began the
    practice of Physick, I was so often call'd up soon after
    retiring to Rest, that I found it most convenient to sit to
    a late Hour, and thus acquired a Habit of sitting up late,
    which necessarily occasioned my lying in bed to a late Hour
    in the Morning--till 7 o'cl'k in Summer and 8 in Winter. My
    Business was fatiguing and called for ample repose, and I
    have always taken care to have a full proportion of Sleep,
    which I suppose has contributed to my longevity.

           _Recollections & Memorandums of Past Events._

    The first thing that I entirely remember was the funeral of
    Aunt Oulton, which was on July 18, 1732.

    The first Aurora Borealis I ever saw, the Northern or rather
    Northeast Sky appeared suffused by a dark blood-red colored
    vapour, without any variety of different colored rays. I
    have never since seen the like. This was about the year
    1734. Northern lights were then a novelty, and excited great
    wonder and terror among the vulgar.

    In 1737, Square Toed Shoes were going out of fashion; I
    believe few or none were worn after 1737. Buckles instead of
    Shoe Strings began to be used about the same time, but were
    not universal in the country towns till 1740 or 1742. Very
    broad brim'd Hats were worn as early as I remember. My
    father had a beaver whose Brims were at least 7 inches;
    which when he left off, I remember I used to wear in the
    Garden, or in a shower, by way of Umbrella. They were all
    cock'd triangularly. And pulling them off by way of
    salutation was invariably the Fashion by all who had any
    Breeding.

    Boots were never worn except on horseback, or snowy or rainy
    weather. They frequently had large broad Tops that reach'd
    full half way up the Thigh. But Boots did not come into
    general use till the close of the revolutionary war.

    Funerals were extravagantly expensive. Gold Rings to each of
    the Bearers, the Minister, the Physician, &c., were
    frequently given when the family could but ill afford it.
    White gloves in abundance, burnt wine to the company, &c.,
    &c. This extravagance occasioned the enacting sumptuary
    laws, which though they check'd did not entirely suppress
    the complaints till the commencement of the revolutionary
    war.

    In 1749, it was reported the train band list of the town of
    Marblehead was equal to that of the town of Salem. The
    difference is now very great. I suppose Salem has at least
    twice the number of Marblehead.

    [1749.][C] The Houses (in Salem) were generally very
    ordinary. The first handsome house was built by Mr. Jno.
    Turner, then Col. Pickman, then Mr. J. Cabot, &c.

    There was but one ropewalk, and that was on the neck, inside
    the gate. But one tavern of any note, and that was an old
    house at the corner now occupied by Stearns' brick store.
    The Houses for public worship were only the old (first)
    church--the eastern parish--the secession from the first
    church--the Friends' meeting house, and the Episcopal
    church.

    The number of Inhabitants was estimated at between 5 and
    6000.

    The Commerce of this town was chiefly with Spain and
    Portugal and the West Indies, especially with St. Eustatia.
    The Cod fishery was carried on with success and advantage.
    The Schooners were employed on the fishing banks in the
    summer, and in the autumn were laden with Fish, Rum,
    Molasses, and the produce of the country, and sent to
    Virginia and Maryland, and there spent the winter retailing
    their cargoes, and in return brought Corn and Wheat and
    Tobacco. This Virginia voyage was seldom very profitable,
    but as it served to keep the crews together, it was
    continued till more advantageous employment offered.

    There were a few Chaises kept by gentlemen for their own
    use, but it was no easy matter to hire one to go a journey.

    _Salem Observer._

[A] This seems to have been a slip of the pen; the following is his own
calculation, made in 1823, and which from his great degree of
exaggeration falls short of half the actual amount. "If from my age of
20 to 80 years I have walked 5 miles a day, which is a moderate
calculation, I must have gone in that 60 years,

                                           109,500 miles.
    And in the first 20 & last 15 years,    38,325

    In 95 years probably, Total,           147,825


[B] This prohibition could only have regard to the period of his life
time and was occasioned by that extreme modesty which always rendered it
painful to the Doctor to be held up to the public notice.

[C] These remarks refer to the period of Dr. Holyoke's residence in
Salem, preceding the revolution.

Dr. Holyoke during his whole life, it is said, was never fifty miles
distant from the spot where he was born. He was the first person to
receive the degree of M.D. from Harvard College; was the first president
of the Massachusetts Medical Society; and he made in the course of his
life three hundred and twenty-four thousand professional visits.

    ANTIQUITY OF NURSERY RHYMES.--Many of these productions have
    a very curious history, if it could only be traced. Some of
    them probably owe their origin to names distinguished in our
    literature; as Oliver Goldsmith, for instance, is believed
    in his earlier days to have written such compositions. Dr.
    E.F. Rimbault gives us the following particulars as to some
    well-known favorites: "Sing a Song of Sixpence," is as old
    as the sixteenth century. "Three Blind Mice" is found in a
    music-book dated 1609. "The Frog and the Mouse" was licensed
    in 1580. "Three Children Sliding on the Ice" dates from
    1633. "London Bridge is Broken Down" is of unfathomed
    antiquity. "Girls and Boys come out to play" is certainly
    old as the reign of Charles II.; as is also "Lucy Locket
    lost her Pocket," to the tune of which the American song of
    "Yankee Doodle" was written. "Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, where
    have you been?" is of the age of Queen Bess. "Little Jack
    Horner" is older than the seventeenth century. "The Old
    Woman Tossed in a Blanket" is of the reign of James II., to
    which monarch it is supposed to allude.

Some British opinions of Benedict Arnold.

    "The good whigs of America," says a late paper, "may be
    assured, that the infamous BENEDICT ARNOLD'S mansion is the
    very next to TYBURN,--a well chosen habitation for such an
    abandoned traitor: A step or two conveys him to that fatal
    spot, where the most guilty of all the miserable beings who
    have ever suffered, was perfectly innocent compared with
    him.--He lives despised by the nobility and gentry, and
    execrated by the people at large--countenanced by none
    excepting their Britannic and Satanic Majesties, and such of
    their adherents, respectively, who are looking for promotion
    under their royal masters."

    By a gentleman from the southward we learn that it is
    expected Congress will fix their permanent residence at
    Philadelphia.

    By very recent accounts from St. John, Nova-Scotia, we are
    informed that _Benedict Arnold_, having attempted to JOCKY
    some of the inhabitants out of their property, but being
    detected, and the people being much exasperated, offered to
    deliver him up to the Americans for ten dollars; but alas!
    before the bargain was firmly agreed on, he made his escape
    to Halifax, and there got protection from the populace.


    We are informed that Benedict Arnold lately sailed from
    New-Brunswick for London. It is said that his residence in
    America, even among the provincial Loyalists, was rather
    uncomfortable; he therefore wisely preferred being
    enveloped in the atmosphere of London to residing on a
    continent which had been the theatre of his traitorous acts,
    and consequently the occasion of more frequent reflections
    on the infamy of his crimes.

                    _Nugaeque canorae._                      Hor.

    I LOOK upon it as the greatest happiness of my life, that
    fortune has given me _a name_ that corresponds with my
    nature and constitution. Patriotism is the strongest
    passion; and I glory in being a _Yankee_.--A _Yankee_ is any
    man born in New-England--and New-England contains the three
    northern States, and a certain _little, pestiferous, pseudo
    Island_. My countrymen generally have the credit of being a
    good-natured, psalm-singing, religious kind of men, very
    honest, but plaguy hard in their dealings--insomuch that a
    _Carolinian_ or a _Georgian_ frequently swear that the very
    _Satan_ himself could never get to windward of them.

    This puts me in mind of a story.--A certain Boston sea
    Captain, of a sloop of 60 tons burthen, coming with a cargo
    of New-England rum, shoes, cheese, potatoes, and other
    valuable commodities, into _Broadway_, which you must know
    is a very _narrow_ passage in the _Appomatax_, a branch of
    _James River_ in _Virginia_.--Before I proceed I must
    acquaint the serious reader--and who is there but must be
    serious in reading the solemn truths I am about to
    declare--that every _iota_ of what I shall delineate in in
    these sacred depositories of facts, is TRUTH.----I am now
    about to elucidate the psalm-singing, religious character of
    _Yankees_, by a TRUE STORY, _never before
    published_.----When our Boston sea Captain, therefore, came
    into Broadway, a Virginian comes a-board of him--and as he
    goes down into the cabbin, had to stoop a little, because
    the cabbin was low--for, as I said before, the sloop was 60
    tons, although our religious sea-captain _entered_ but 40
    tons at the Naval-Office: Howsomever he had a reserve of
    conscience, for the Naval-Officer charged him for _light
    money_, when there was not one light-house in all the
    ancient dominion.--But this is nothing to my story.

    _N.B._ I mean to give the good-natured reader a whole
    chapter on _the art of_ STORY-TELLING.

    Well, as I was saying, the Virginian being obliged to
    stoop--the _stooping_ caused his head to be bowed down; and
    looking down, he saw a _book_ lying upon the starboard
    locker.--Well, says he, and what the d----l--but I think it
    expedient to omit the _Virginian_ oath; for this man, not
    being a moral man, swore consumedly, and did not know a
    _bible_ by sight, but only by _hearsay_.--And Captain, cried
    the _Virginian_, will you sell this bible of yours: I hear
    it's a mighty clever book for children.--And why not for
    grown people? cried the Captain, taking up the _book_. Why,
    quoth the _Virginian_, because I mean my three boys, who are
    from 11 to 14 years old, shall be good _scholards at their
    larning_--they can all say their letters already, and the
    youngest can spell.--The Boston sea Captain opening the
    bible found these words: "_Search the scriptures_;" and
    without saying any thing himself, pointed out the passage to
    the _Virginian_.--Pugh! said the _Virginian_, and walked
    upon deck.--Now, to explain this mystery, you must know the
    Yankee sea Captain shewed him the passage to denote that he
    would sooner sell his soul to the d----l, than his bible to
    a _Virginian_;--and the _Virginian_ said pugh! and walked
    upon deck, because he could not read.

    LONGEVITY. Since we published the examples of longevity,
    collected by the editor of the Medical Adviser, we have seen
    another list, which is _supposed_ to comprise all, which can
    be found from the year 66 to 1799. The number of those who
    lived from _one hundred_ and _seventy_ to _one hundred_ and
    _eighty-five_ years is 3; from _one hundred_ and _sixty_ to
    _one hundred_ and _seventy_, 2; from _one hundred_ and
    _fifty_ to _one hundred_ and _sixty_, 3; from _one hundred_
    and _forty_ to _one hundred_ and _fifty_, 7; from _one
    hundred_ and _thirty_ to _one hundred_ and _forty_, 26; from
    _one hundred_ and _twenty_ to _one hundred_ and _thirty_,
    84; from _one hundred_ and _ten_ to _one hundred_ and
    _twenty_, 277; from _one hundred_ to _one hundred_ and
    _ten_, 1310. Total of those who survived a century,
    _Seventeen hundred and twelve_.----This writer could not
    have included in his list the examples of longevity which
    Russia furnished, for we frequently find in the bills of
    mortality of this country for a single year, twice the
    number of centenarians. We have before us the table of
    deaths for 1813, which gives the following remarkable ages.
    One 165;--three 135;--one 130;--fifteen 125;--thirty-three
    from 115 to 120;--fifty-three from 110 to 115;--one hundred
    and twenty-seven from 100 to 105;--fourteen hundred from 95
    to 100;--two thousand eight hundred and forty-nine from 90
    to 95;--four thousand four hundred and fifty-one from 85 to
    90. Whole number of deaths 971,338.

Boston shop-signs in 1789.

    To read the signs in this town is a delicate, sentimental
    repast.--I hope _Bostonians_ will never complain of want of
    amusement, while there is one sign standing. If I had time,
    I would certainly consult _Milton_, to see how he has
    _arranged_ matters in his description of _chaos_.--I doubt
    not I could there get a _hint_ for two whole chapters. I had

                       A CURIOUS WOMAN.

We have often heard it said that men are curious, and we can well
believe it; but now we find it recorded that there has been at least
_one_ curious woman. Read the following extract from the "Salem Gazette"
of 1795:--

In our opinion the oft-repeated words "awfully good," "jolly fine," and
similar expressions, which sound so "charmingly sweet" from the lips of
interesting young ladies, are quite cast into the shade by language used
in the following extract from the Portsmouth, N.H., "Oracle of the

    A FEW years since, a young gentleman at the University in
    _Cambridge_ asked of a Collegian the loan of his _W_irgil.
    The inelegant pronunciation of the word _Virgil_ was
    burlesqued by the young Collegian in the following story,
    with which his invention readily supplied him:--_Lately_
    (says he) _I set out on a woyage to Wersailles, with one
    Captain Winal, in a British wessel called the Wiper; but we
    soon met with a wiolent storm, which drove us into a port in
    Wirginia; where one Capt. Waughn, a wery wicious man,
    inwited us aboard his wessel, and gave us some weal and
    wenison, with some winegar, which made me wery sick; so I
    did womit like wengeance;_ (and added, reaching out the
    book) _You may have my Wirgil, and welcome_. This humor had
    the desired effect; the young gentleman saw the absurdity of
    doing such w_iolence_ to the letter V, and has ever since
    spoke like other people.

What Mr. Welby, an English gentleman, saw when he was in the United
States in 1821. A very flattering picture of the West.

                       More Travellers' Stories.

                     _From the National Gazette._

    A new book of Travels in America has been recently issued in
    London which rivals the volumes of our old friends Weld,
    Ashe, Fearon, &c. It is entitled "A Visit to North America
    and the English Settlements in Illinois, with a winter
    residence in Philadelphia; solely to ascertain the actual
    prosperity of the Emigrating Agriculturist, Mechanic, and
    Commercial Speculator"--by Adlard Welby, _Esquire_, of South
    Rauceby, Lincolnshire. This esquire has said enough, should
    he be believed, to settle ultimately the point of the truth
    or falsehood of Godwin's notable doctrine, that we owe the
    increase of our numbers chiefly to emigration. No sane
    European would venture among us after having read Mr.
    Welby's book. He discovered that, in Philadelphia, living
    was _very dear_, comfort _very uncommon_, and good manners
    still more rare. Throughout his journey he found in the
    taverns "a system of impertinence, rudeness, rascality, and
    filth, rendered more intolerable by an antipathy to the
    English, in the brutal manifestation of which most of the
    Colonel, Doctor, and Squire, keepers of the taverns, were
    pleased to indulge." When he asked an hostler to call him
    early in the morning, he was answered that--he might call
    himself and be d----d. In the Western country he found no
    symptoms of hospitality--witnessed only idleness and
    licentiousness, and experienced every where brutal rudeness
    and unbounded extortion. The western people usually combine
    in cheating all travellers, and sometimes "_rifle_," that is
    _shoot_ residents among them who do not choose to descend to
    their own level. In Illinois "a party proposed to each other
    _coolly_ to go and shoot neighbour *****, who had behaved
    ill to them sundry times; it was agreed upon; they went to
    his field, found the old man at plough, and, with unerring
    aim, laid him dead." And Mr. Welby adds that the country
    would be desirable to live in, did not the folks _shoot_
    each other thus, and were they not half savages. The
    _shooting_ case reminds us of a traveller's story which we
    heard at a dinner table abroad. A gentleman and esquire of
    strict veracity, like Mr. Welby, related, in order to shew
    how common was the calamity of the _coup de soleil_, or
    stroke of the sun, in the Island of JAVA, that sitting once
    in the house of an opulent merchant of Batavia, drinking a
    _cool_ glass of Madeira after dinner, with the merchant's
    wife in the room, the lady was, in the twinkling of an eye,
    _reduced to a heap of ashes_ by a _coup de soleil_; when the
    husband observed to his guest, "don't be alarmed--we are
    accustomed to this;" then rang the bell with great
    composure, and on the appearance of the servant, _coolly_
    said--"Boy--sweep your mistress out, and _bring us clean
    glasses._"

    In the neighborhood of Mr. Birbeck's settlement in Illinois,
    Mr. Welby could obtain neither eggs, milk, sugar, salt, nor
    water; and when he and his party sent a request to Mr.
    Birbeck for some water, the answer returned was, he made it
    a general rule to refuse every one. Mr. Birbeck is
    represented as having deceived and disappointed most of the
    English who were lured to his settlement by his "Journal."
    Mr. W. could discover none of "the snug cottages, with
    adjoining piggeries, cowsteads, gardens and orchards," which
    Mr. B. had introduced into his canvass. He found nothing but
    the primitive log building, that served the whole
    family--"for parlour, for kitchen, and hall." "The strange
    heterogeneous mixture of characters," says Mr. W. "which are
    collected here by the magic pen of Morris Birbeck, is truly
    ludicrous. Among many others, a couple now attend to the
    store at Albion who lately lived in a dashing style in
    London, not far from Bond-street; the lady brought over her
    white satin shoes and gay dresses, rich carpets, and
    everything but what in such a place she would require--yet
    I have understood that they have accommodated themselves to
    their new situations, hand out the plums, sugar, whiskey,
    &c., with tolerable grace, and at least 'do not seem to mind
    it.'"

    In one of the principal literary journals of London, Mr.
    Welby's book is recommended as "carrying on its front the
    stamp of plain dealing, _truth_ and candor, and entitled,
    from internal evidence, to the highest authority amid the
    conflicting statements and opinions respecting emigration to
    America." The reviewer adds:--"From a country so destitute
    of moral beauty as the author depicts it, so disgusting in
    its human externals, and so low in the scale, not merely of
    refinement, but of good principles, we are happy to
    withdraw." As Mr. Welby spent a winter in Philadelphia, and
    had acquaintance here, it is probable that such of the
    latter as have not seen his book will be pleased to know the
    complexion of its contents.

In the "Essex Register" of July 18, 1833, may be found the following
notice of two well-known American authors:--

    DISCOURSE ON GENIUS. The Richmond Compiler speaks in terms
    of great praise of a discourse delivered recently in
    Richmond, before a Young Men's Society, by Joseph Hulbert
    Nicholas. A number of extracts are also given in the
    Compiler, as specimens of the performance, from which we
    take the following notices of two of our
    fellow-townsmen.--_Boston Courier._

    Of Charles Sprague, of Massachusetts, no language can be
    spoken but that of unqualified praise. Forsaking the modern
    school of writing, he is contented with being simple and
    natural. Sublimity, tenderness, wit, elegance, and
    beneficial satire characterise his muse.--The only complaint
    I have ever heard made of him is that _he does not write
    more_.

    Of Nathaniel Parker Willis, a native of Massachusetts, and a
    fellow-student with myself at Yale College, I come now to
    speak. Of him I shall speak familiarly, as of an intimate
    friend; and impartially and justly, as one who wishes him
    well. Willis, I venture to pronounce the most remarkable
    genius our country has yet produced. I do not call him
    remarkable merely for his unusual precocity of song, but
    remarkable for the possession of that rare genius, which by
    any man, young or old, in our land, I do not think has ever
    been displayed. Nature has done wonderful things for him;
    but alas! he has thus far done but little for himself. The
    great pieces he has sometimes given us have cost him but
    little effort, and he has thrown out his productions, in
    prose as well as poetry, with a profusion and a variety that
    seem miraculous; and yet, of all our bards, he has met with
    the most severe and merciless censures. In some measure he
    has deserved the treatment. In College he would not
    condescend to study, and charity only for his high genius
    enabled him to gain a degree. Besides, he gained his first
    and best reputation by pieces founded upon scriptural
    subjects, and he stood committed to the world as a
    _religious_ man. Many who had never seen aught of him but
    his productions, and had formed the loftiest estimate of his
    personal character from the pure tendency of his effusions,
    were astonished and grieved when introduced to the
    author.--His head made giddy by the praises of young and
    old, he forgot himself, and possessing most shrewd good
    sense, he would talk the reverse. He became fantastic in
    apparel, as he did likewise in his style of writing; made
    himself too common, and almost broke a pious father's heart
    by deserting the altar of that divine Jesus upon whose Bible
    he had founded the fairest fabric of his fame. My friend, of
    whom I so sternly speak, is now in Italy; and should these
    remarks, per chance, ever meet his eye, I beseech him by our
    past friendship, by our walks "by moon or glittering
    star-light," through the Eden groves and avenues of
    New-Haven, by the love he bears to his parents, and above
    all, by the love he bears that Saviour, upon whose image and
    the scenes of whose mortal pilgrimage he is rapturously
    gazing, in the matchless pictures of the Italian masters, I
    beseech him, when he returns to his native land, to wear no
    longer a ridiculous mask, but to appear in his own native
    strength, dignity, and surpassing loveliness.

In the "Salem Observer," March 8, 1834, are to be found the following
references to well-known young ladies of the day. Miss Silsbee is
supposed to be the daughter of the Hon. Nathaniel Silsbee, of Salem,
Massachusetts senator in Congress. She afterwards married Jared Sparks,
the well-known historian, president of Harvard College, etc.

    HIGH LIFE AT WASHINGTON. The Washington Correspondent of the
    Boston Morning Post, in describing Gov. Cass's soiree, thus
    notices some of the young ladies who were present:--

    Miss Keyser of Baltimore, uniting youth and beauty,
    possesses an eye as dark as the absence of all light,
    beaming with a lustre that eclipses all. I never saw a
    countenance betoken such perfect happiness; it was like a
    star-lit lake, curling its lips into ripples in some dream
    of delight, as the west wind salutes them with its balmy
    breath and disturbs their placid slumber. I never before
    realised Byron's idea of

        "Music breathing o'er the face;"

    till Miss Keyser's brought it home to the business and
    bosom.

    Miss Silsbee, of Salem, with a form of great symmetry,
    possesses a countenance not only beautiful, but entirely
    intellectual--the most so of any you have met with either
    here or elsewhere; it is of the Italian model; and should
    have basked beneath an Italian sky. She is very easy,
    graceful and modest in her deportment, and dresses 'rich not
    gaudy;' the cameo necklace that graced her person was only
    the foil that set off the diamond.

    Miss Harper of Baltimore, with a fine face and form, is
    particularly unrivalled for a bust of unrivalled symmetry;
    it would furnish a model for a Canova; and reminds me of
    Greenough's Medora.

    Miss M'Lane of this city, with many separate charms that
    could not fail of attraction, unites with them the finest of
    fine forms.

    And last, not least, the younger Miss Cass possesses the
    most perfect _Madonna_ countenance I have ever seen clothed
    in living lustre. It was one of the first that attracted my
    attention when I entered the saloon, and the last that
    received my parting glance when I retired; it seemed to be--

        "While in, above the world;"

    I am told it is entirely characteristic; that she is in
    heart and thought, what you behold in her
    countenance--happy, but not gay; serious but not sad;
    devout, yet not a devotee.

In the "Salem Gazette" of 1815 is the following curious information
about Scott's novels, which shows how easy it is for people to be
mistaken.

    William Erskine, Esq. is said to be the author of the new
    and interesting Novel, "_Guy Mannering_."--Walter Scott had
    been pronounced the author.

    WAVERLY.--It is not yet decided to whom this very
    interesting novel belongs. It came into the world with all
    the advantage that the name of Walter Scott could give it;
    but Guy Mannering's appearance seems to have dissolved that
    connection. An article in our first page attributes the work
    to Wm. Erskine; but in the last North-American Review we
    read the following:--"An English Magazine says, the author
    of Waverly and Guy Mannering is a young gentleman of the
    name of FORBES, the son of a Scotch baronet." The Review
    remarks, that the extract in the title page of the latter,
    from the _Lay of the Last Minstrel_, was a delicate way of
    informing the public that they were under a mistake in
    attributing the former to Walter Scott.

On the 16th June, 1806, there was a total eclipse of the sun. The
following is all the "Salem Gazette" of the 17th has to say of such a
remarkable event.

    Yesterday the great Solar Eclipse took place, agreeably to
    the calculations which had been made. The day was very
    favourable to viewing it. The air was remarkably clear, and
    there was not a cloud in the hemisphere. As the sun shut
    in, the stars appeared, and many were visible at the time of
    total darkness. A considerable alteration in the temperature
    of the atmosphere was felt during the continuance of the
    Eclipse.

In the "Boston Palladium" of 1819, copied from a London paper, is Lord

Samuel Sewall, whose remarkable "Diary" has within a few years been
printed by the Massachusetts Historical Society, appears to have been
the successor of John Foster, who printed the first book ever issued
from the press in Boston,--namely, "Hubbard's Election Sermon,"--in
1676. All previous printing in the colony had been executed at
Cambridge. Mr. Hubbard was the minister of Ipswich.

                        SAMUEL SEWALL.

    When John Foster (the first who carried on printing in
    Boston) died in 1681, the town was without the benefit of
    the press; but a continuance of it being thought necessary,
    _Samuel Sewall_, not a printer but a magistrate, and a man
    much respected, was selected as a proper person to manage
    the concerns of it, and as such was recommended to the
    general court. In consequence of this recommendation, the
    court, in Oct. 1681, gave him liberty to carry on the
    business of printing in Boston. The _license_ is thus
    recorded: "Samuel Sewall, at the instance of some Friends,
    with respect to the accommodation of the public, being
    prevailed with to undertake the Management of the Printing
    Press in Boston, late under the command of Mr. John Foster,
    deceased, liberty is accordingly granted to him for the same
    by this court, and none may presume to set up any other
    Press without the like Liberty first granted."

    Sewall became a bookseller.--Books for himself and others
    were printed at the press under his management; as were
    several acts and laws, with other works for government.
    Samuel Green, jun., was his printer. In 1682 an order passed
    the general court for the treasurer to pay Sewall ten pounds
    seventeen shillings, for printing the election sermon,
    delivered that year by the Rev. Mr. Torrey.

    In 1684, Sewall, by some means, was unable to conduct the
    press, and requested permission of the general court to be
    released from his engagement. This was granted; the record
    of his release is in the words following.

    "Samuel Sewall by the providence of God being unable to
    attend the press, &c., requested leave to be freed from his
    obligations concerning it, which was granted, with thanks
    for the liberty then granted."

    In 1684, and for several subsequent years, the loss of the
    charter occasioned great confusion and disorder in the
    political concerns of the colony. Soon after Sewall resigned
    his office as conductor of the press in Boston, he went to
    England, and he returned in 1692. He was undoubtedly the
    same Samuel Sewall who, when a new charter was granted by
    king William, was for many years one of the council for the
    province, and who, in 1692, was appointed one of the Judges
    of the Superior Court; in 1715 Judge of Probate; and in
    1718, Chief Justice of Massachusetts. He died Jan. 1, 1729,
    aged 78 years.--_Boston News Letter._

Knowledge of natural history at the Isles of Shoals in the early part of
the last century.

    A CENTURY AGO. The N. York Gazette relates that when Rev.
    Mr. Tuck, in the early part of the last century, was
    ordained minister of Star Island, one of a cluster called
    the Isles of Shoals, his parish offered him, beside the
    usual parsonage house, a quintal of fish each family, but no
    money, as a salary. It is well known that the fish cured at
    these islands are called dun fish, and have the highest
    reputation for excellence wherever known. They are caught in
    the depth of winter, and are fit for market before the hot
    weather. They derive the name of _dun_ from the color which
    they assume. There were at the period of which we speak,
    about fifty families in the cluster, giving him fifty
    quintals per year. The average price of a dun fish is about
    ten dollars, and the worthy pastor always procured a ready
    sale for them, thereby realizing his five hundred dollars
    per annum. With this stipend he flourished, and brought up
    a family, whom he educated himself, and fitted one of his
    sons for entrance into Harvard College. The lad had never
    been away from the Shoals till he reached Long wharf on his
    way to Cambridge. He had never seen a horse, nor heard a
    church bell. On landing, he saw many horses attached to
    various vehicles; and speaking to his father, said, "Only
    see what queer cows they have in Boston! they are not shaped
    like ours, and are all without horns." In passing by the Old
    South, in Cornhill, the big bell of that church struck up a
    peal, the effect of which nearly drove the young man mad.

What Captain Hall, R.N., thought of a Salem gentleman.

    _From Capt. Basil Hall's Travels in America--just
                     published._

    We reached the town of Salem in good time for dinner; and
    here I feel half tempted to break through my rule, in order
    to give some account of our dinner-party, chiefly, indeed,
    that I might have an opportunity of expatiating--which I
    could do with perfect truth and great pleasure--on the
    conversation of our excellent host. For I have rarely, in
    any country, met a man so devoid of prejudice, or so willing
    to take all matters on their favorable side, and withal, who
    was so well informed about every thing in his own and in
    other countries, or who was more ready to impart his
    knowledge to others.

    To these agreeable attributes and conversational powers he
    adds such a mirthfulness of fancy, and genuine heartiness of
    good-humour, to all men, women, and children who have the
    good fortune to make his acquaintance, that I should have no
    scruple--if it were not too great a liberty--in naming him
    as the person I have been most pleased with in all my recent
    travels.

    After dinner, we repaired to the Museum, the rich treasures
    of which have been collected exclusively by captains or
    supercargoes of vessels out of Salem, who had doubled one or
    other of the great southern promontories,--the Cape, and the
    Horn, as they are technically called by seamen. As my eye
    fell on numberless carefully cherished objects, which I had
    often seen in familiar use on the other side of the globe,
    my imagination revelled far and wide into regions I may
    never live to see again.

Mrs. Trollope avers that pigs are caressed by the ladies and gentlemen
of New York.

                        "REFUGEE IN AMERICA."

    NEW-YORK AND BOSTON. Mrs. Trollope, in her new work, called
    the Refugee in America, introduces some queer comparisons
    between the manners of the two cities. We quote for
    example:--"In Boston, there are no persons allowed to vote
    at the elections of President or Governor of that province
    but native born yankees; while at New-York, emigrants are
    forced from the ships in which they arrive directly to the
    hustings, which are kept open the first two weeks of every
    month at Mason's lodge, Broadway, where they are allowed to
    jostle off the sidewalks the most respectable inhabitants.
    If they are reproved for such conduct, the answer invariably
    is,--'Isn't this a land of liberty?' I was one forenoon
    myself stopped at the lodge and offered a vote, with the
    preliminary question,--'Are you a Clay or a Jackson man?' In
    Boston, a person seen with a segar in his mouth in the
    street, is counted a blackguard; but in New-York no
    gentleman makes his promenade without one. In Boston, a
    housekeeper would be placed at the Sessions dock for
    suffering the refuse of his mansion to be thrown into the
    street; while in N. York he would be fined $1 if he allowed
    it to be thrown elsewhere near his premises. Swine is a
    Bostonian's bane, and a N. Yorker's antidote,--indeed this
    animal is as much caressed by the ladies and gentlemen of
    the latter city, as a lap-dog in London or Paris. The
    Governor and his twenty chosen ministers have made it a
    capital offence to molest one of these interesting
    quadrupeds while roaming the streets!"--[Oh! what a lying
    jade!]

    EARLY ACCOUNTS OF NEW-ENGLAND. The first settlers of

    vision. One of them speaks of lions in Cape Ann: another
    (Josselyn), who arrived at Boston in 1663, and resided in
    this Colony about eight years, says of our frogs, "some,
    when they sit upon their breech, are a foot high, and some
    as long as a child one year old." He likewise says "old
    barley frequently degenerates into oats" in New-England.

"Enthusiasm" is described as a nervous disorder by Dr. Douglass, author
of the Historical Summary.

    DR. DOUGLASS'S NOTICE OF SALEM. In looking over Dr.
    Douglass' historical summary, we found the following note on
    Salem. The author formerly lived in Boston, and after his
    removal to England, published his work in 1749. As he was a
    physician, he probably considered himself authorized to
    broach new theories. He certainly showed his ingenuity in
    imputing to our soil a tendency to produce the diseases of
    which he makes mention. It is perhaps fortunate for us that
    the Doctor did not live in our day, as he would have found
    in the excitement which has recently prevailed here in
    relation to the Mill Dam, Theatre, &c., new proofs of the
    correctness of his hypothesis.

    "In Salem and its neighborhood _Enthusiasm_ and other
    _nervous disorders_ seem to be _endemial_. _Hypochondriack_,
    _hysterick_, and other _maniack_ disorders prevail there,
    and Ipswich adjoining, to this day."

    AS sound as a nut o'er the plain,

      As happy as happy could be.

    As plump as a partridge I grew,

    My slumbers were calmer than dew,
      My body was fatter than pork.

      My peace that would trouble so soon,
    And thought not of danger nor harm,
      Any more than the man in the moon.

    But now to my sorrow I find
      Her heart is as hard as a brick,
    To my passion forever unkind,
      Though of love I am full as a tick.

    I sought her affection to win,
      In hope of obtaining relief;
    Till I like a hatchet grew thin,
      And she, like a haddock, grew deaf.

    I late was as fat as a doe,

A new way to cure insanity.

                         _A CURIOUS IDEA._

    KNOWLEDGE is attained with the greatest difficulty; we have
    it not by intuition, but acquire it by many unsuccessful
    trials and long experience. One gives a hint, and the other
    improves it; but prejudice and ignorance too often stand in
    the way: "_That cannot be,_" or "_I cannot believe that,_"
    has crushed many an useful project. How incredible did the
    recovery of drowned persons appear at first! When the report
    reached England, that many abroad had been brought again to
    life, after laying under water some time, who gave it
    credit? But experience has since convinced us of its
    possibility.

    Now, from the great success attending the recovery of
    drowned persons, I would offer a hint to the public, and
    leave it to be improved by them, respecting the recovery of
    those who are mad, and given up as incurable.

    When madness breaks forth, the first care of the physician
    is to reduce and keep his patient low, in order to check the
    velocity and whirl of his thoughts; and if possible to
    procure sleep, by quieting the internal turbulency. If all
    his skill and efforts fail, such a person is as much lost to
    society as if he were dead. Now if such an one were plunged
    into water, and there kept until he was apparently dead, and
    was then recovered by the usual methods (and of which
    recovery we have now a moral certainty) I am apt to believe
    we should behold a perfect cure. There is, I own, something
    shocking to nature in the experiment; but if the patient be
    already lost, and dead to society, why should we hesitate a
    moment to make the trial, when the probability of succeeding
    is so flattering?

    Its house each acre, every mile its town;
    With gilded spire the frequent church is seen,
    Sacred to him that taught them to be keen;
    Eternal squabblings grease the lawyer's paw,
    All have their suits, and all have studied law;
    With tongue that art and nature taught to speak,
    Some rave in Latin, some dispute in Greek;
    Proud of their books, in ancient lore they shine,
    And one month's study makes a learn'd divine;
    Fond to converse, with deep designing views,

    Fond of his wit, but fonder to be paid,

    While he that comes, as surely hears them praise

    In learning's walks explore the mazy way

In an old Salem paper we find the following:

    --> We understand the number of deaths in this town the past
    year was 234, of which 15 died abroad.

This reminds us of the curious jumble made in the first edition of
Morse's "American Gazetteer," published in Boston in 1797. In the
description of Albany, N.Y., it says: "This city and suburbs, by
enumeration in 1797, contained 1,263 buildings, of which 863 were
dwelling-houses and 6,021 inhabitants. Many of them are in the Gothic
style with the gable end to the street, which custom the first settlers
brought from Holland."

    The earliest American writer of whom we have any information
    was Peter Bulkley, who was born in England in 1583 and died
    in 1659 in Massachusetts, and wrote Latin Poetry and
    Sermons. The earliest poetic volume written in this country
    was by Anne Bradstreet, of Boston, born 1612, died 1672.

    WHEN Oliver Cromwell first coined his money, an old cavalier
    looking upon one of the new pieces, read this inscription on

Two different ways of telling a story.

    _Anecdote_. A CLERGYMAN, who in the Matrimonial Lottery had
    drawn much worse than a _blank_, and, without the patience
    of Socrates, had to encounter the turbulent spirit of
    Xantippe, was interrupted in the middle of a _Curtain
    Lecture_, by the arrival of a pair, requesting his
    assistance to introduce them to the _blessed_ state of
    Wedlock. The poor Priest, actuated at the moment by his own
    feelings and particular _experience_, rather than a sense of
    canonical duty, opened the book, and began: "_Man, that is
    born of a Woman, hath but a short time to live, and is full
    of trouble, &c., &c.,_" repeating the _burial_ service. The
    astonished Bridegroom exclaimed, "Sir! Sir! you mistake, I
    came here to be _married_, not _buried_!" "Well (replied the
    Clergyman), if you insist on it, I am _obliged_ to marry
    you--but believe me, my friend, you had _better_ be
    _buried_."

    ANECDOTE. It is doubtless recollected that Dean Swift,
    though a great favorite among the ladies, was (no doubt for
    good and substantial reasons) nevertheless a bachelor. His
    opinion of the married state seemed to be not very much
    exalted. On one occasion, he had been called upon to marry a
    couple, and after getting them properly arranged, commenced
    as follows: "Man, that is born of a woman, hath but a short
    time to live, and is full of misery," &c. "My dear sir,"
    interrupted the bridegroom, "you are reading the burial
    service, instead of the matrimonial." "Never mind, friend,"
    whispered the Dean, "_you had better be buried than
    married_."

    No common anguish prompts the falling tear--
      No common virtues those she now deplores.

    Dear hapless girl, was there no saving power?
      Where was your guardian angel--where your friend?
    Could nought prevent the fatal destin'd hour?
      Nor pitying Heaven would hear or succour lend.

    Then, if nor Heaven _would_ hear--nor friends _could_ save,
      Be still, my heart, nor breathe another sigh;
    Drop the last tear upon her early grave,
      And let it teach you--that _the best must die_.

    On deck flew every gallant tar,

    Within a hammock's narrow bound,

      The first was he, of all the crew,
    On deck to spring--to trim the sail--
      To steer--to reef--to furl or clue.

      Which nature cast in finest mould;
    The midwatch bell now smote his heart,
      His last, his dying knell it toll'd.

    _Origin of the word_ DUN.--Dunny, in the provincial dialect
    of several countries, signifies deaf: to dun, then, perhaps
    may mean, to deafen with importunate demands. Some derive it
    from the word _donnez_, which signifies _give_; but the true
    original meaning of the word owes its birth to one Joe Dun,
    a famous bailiff of the town of Lincoln, so extremely active
    and so dexterous in his business, that it became a proverb,
    when a man refused to pay, "Why do you not _dun_ him?" that
    is, Why do not you set _Dun_ to arrest him?--Hence it became
    a cant-word, and is now as old as since the days of Henry
    VII. Dun was also the general name of hangman, before that
    of Jack-ketch.

        And presently a halter got,
        Made of the best strong hempen tear,
        And e'er a cat could lick her ear,
        Had tied it up with as much art,
        As Dun himself could do for 's heart.

                                   COTTON'S VIRGIL TRA. BOOK iv.

    It is curious to observe that _Dun_, who, as we said before,
    was _finisher of the law_ in the reign of Henry VII., had a
    son, who became a bailiff--This bailiff having scraped some
    money together, made his son an attorney, who changed the
    name of _Dun_ to _Dunning_--the rest of the genealogy are
    well known.

    _Biographical Correctness_.--As a specimen of the accurate
    way in which Biographical Dictionaries are made up, the
    Enquirer refers to Dr. Watkins' volume, in which he writes
    down that John Adams "died in 1803."--And yet for 23 years
    after this date, the old patriarch was living in health and
    happiness. A still more ludicrous blunder appeared a few
    years since in a French Biographical Dictionary, in which it
    was stated that the now venerable John Jay, who yet lives
    full of years and full of honors, was a Frenchman, who,
    after having framed the Constitution of the State of
    New-York, and witnessed the close of the American
    revolution, returned to France--became a member of the
    French Convention, and was finally brought to the
    guillotine!--_N.Y. Com. Adv._

    The works of John Paul Richter are almost unintelligible to
    any but Germans, and even to some of them. A worthy German,
    just before Richter's death, edited a complete edition of
    his works, in which one particular passage fairly puzzled
    him. Determined to have it explained at the source, he went
    to John Paul himself and asked him what was the meaning of
    the mysterious passage.--John Paul's reply was very German
    and characteristic: "My good friend," said he, "when I wrote
    that passage, God and I knew what it meant; it is possible
    that God knows it still; but as for me, I have totally
    forgotten."

    ORIGIN OF "FOOLSCAP" PAPER. It is known that Charles I. of
    England, granted numerous monopolies for the support of his
    government. Among others was the privilege of manufacturing
    paper. The water mark of the finest sort was the royal arms
    of England. The consumption of this article was great at
    this time, and large fortunes were made by those who had
    purchased the exclusive right to vend it. This, among other
    monopolies, was set aside by the parliament that brought
    Charles to the scaffold, and by way of showing their
    contempt for the king, they ordered the royal arms to be
    taken from the paper, and a fool, with his cap and bells, to
    be substituted. It is now more than an hundred and
    seventy-five years since the fool's cap and bells were taken
    from the paper, but still, paper of the size which the Rump
    Parliament ordered for the journals bears the name of the
    water mark then ordered as an indignity to Charles.

    A new version of "Yankee Doodle," from the "Salem Gazette,"
    July, 1811.

                             YANKEY SONG.

    [_The following song was composed a few years since by a
    gentleman then one of the officers of the Salem regiment, to
    be sung at the military celebration of the 4th of July. Its
    wit and pleasantry continues it a favorite with the Yankies,
    and it was again sung by the Military at Lynn Hotel, and by
    the Federalists at Washington Hall, on the late
    anniversary._]

                  I.

    Yankey Doodle is the tune
      Americans delight in;
    'Twill do to whistle, sing, or play,
      And just the thing for fighting.

                  CHORUS.

    _Yankey Doodle, Boys; Huzza!
      Down outside--up the middle--
    Yankey Doodle_, fa, sol, la,
      _Trumpet, Drum, and Fiddle._

                  II.

    Should Great Britain, Spain, or France
      Wage war upon our shore, sir,
    We'll lead them such a _woundy_ dance,
      They'll find their toes are sore, sir.
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  III.

    Should a haughty foe expect
      To give our boys a caning,
    We _guess_ they'll find our boys have _larnt_
      A _little bit_ of training.
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  IV.

    I'll wager now a _mug of flip_,
      And bring it on the table,
    Put Yankey boys aboard a ship,
      To beat them they are able.
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  V.

    Then if they go to _argufy._
      I _rather guess_ they'll find, too,
    We've got a set of _tonguey blades_,
      T'out talk 'em, if _they're mind to._
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  VI.

    America's a _dandy_ place;
      The people are all brothers;
    And when one's got a _pumpkin pye_,
      He shares it with the others.
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  VII.

    We work, and sleep, and pray, in peace--
      By industry we thrive, sir;
    And if a drone won't do his part,
      We'll scout him from the hive, sir.
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  VIII.

    And then, on _Independent Day_,
      (And who's a better right to?)
    We eat and drink, and sing and play,
      And have a dance at night, too.
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  IX.

    Our girls are fair, our boys are tough,
      Our old folks wise and healthy;
    And when we've every thing we want,
      We _count_ that we are wealthy.
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  X.

    We're _happy_, _free_, and _well to do_,
      And cannot want for knowledge;
    For, almost ev'ry mile or two,
      You find a _school_ or _college._
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  XI.

    The land we till is all our own;
      Whate'er the price, we paid it;
    Therefore we'll fight _till all is blue_,
      Should any dare invade it.
    CHORUS.--_Yankey Doodle_, &c.

                  XII.

    Since we're so bless'd, let's eat and drink
    With thankfulness and gladness:
    Should we kick o'er our cup of joy,
    It would be _sartin_ madness.

                  CHORUS.

    _Yankey Doodle, Boys; Huzza!
      Down outside, up the middle--
    Yankey Doodle_, fa, sol, la,

    "Going snacks."

    At the time of the plague in London, a noted body searcher
    lived whose name was _Snacks_. His business increased so
    fast that, finding he could not compass it, he offered to
    any person who should join him in his hardened practice half
    the profits; thus, those who joined him were said to go with
    _Snacks_. Hence going _snacks_, or dividing the spoil.

Many years ago there was published in Boston a small volume entitled
"Eliza Wharton, the Coquette. By a Lady of Massachusetts." It consisted
of a series of letters said to be founded on fact. A young woman died at
the Bell Tavern in Danvers in 1788, whose gravestone a few years ago
might be seen in the old Danvers (now Peabody) burial-ground. We copy
from the "Salem Mercury" of July 29, 1788, the following account:--

    Last Friday, a female stranger died at the Bell Tavern, in
    Danvers; and on Sunday her remains were decently interred.
    The circumstances relative to this woman are such as excite
    curiosity and interest our feelings. She was brought to the
    Bell in a chaise, from Watertown, as she said, by a young
    man whom she had engaged for that purpose. After she had
    alighted, and taken a trunk with her into the house, the
    chaise immediately drove off. She remained at this inn till
    her death, in expectation of the arrival of her husband,
    whom she expected to come for her, and appeared anxious at
    his delay. She was averse to being interrogated concerning
    herself or connexions; and kept much retired to her chamber,
    employed in needle-work, writing, &c. She said, however,
    that she came from Westfield, in Connecticut; that her
    parents lived in that State; that she had been married only
    a few months; and, that her husband's name was Thomas
    Walker;--but always carefully concealed her family name. Her
    linen was all marked E.W. About a fortnight before her
    death, she was brought to bed of a lifeless child. When
    those who attended her apprehended her fate, they asked her,
    whether she did not wish to see her friends: She answered,
    that she was very desirous of seeing them. It was proposed
    that she should send for them; to which she objected,
    hoping in a short time to be able to go to them. From what
    she said, and from other circumstances, it appeared probable
    to those who attended her, that she belonged to some country
    town in Connecticut: Her conversation, her writings and her
    manners, bespoke the advantage of a respectable family &
    good education. Her person was agreeable; her deportment,
    amiable & engaging; and, though in a state of anxiety and
    suspense, she preserved a cheerfulness, which seemed to be
    not the effect of insensibility, but of a firm and patient
    temper. She was supposed to be about 35 years old. Copies of
    letters, of her writing, dated at Hartford, Springfield, and
    other places, were left among her things.--This account is
    given by the family in which she resided; and it is hoped
    the publication of it will be a means of her friends'
    ascertaining her fate.

Elizabeth Whitman was the real name of the stranger, and the following
was the inscription on the stone:--

    "This humble stone, in Memory of Elizabeth Whitman, is
    inscribed by her weeping friends, to whom she endeared
    herself by uncommon tenderness and affection. Endowed with
    superior genius and acquirements, she was still more
    endeared by humility and benevolence. Let candour throw a
    veil over her frailities, for great was her charity to
    others.--She sustained the last painful scene far from
    every friend, and exhibited an example of calm resignation.
    Her departure was on the 25th of July, A.D. 1788, in the
    37th year of her age, and the tears of strangers watered her
    grave."

Although we recollect seeing the stone some years ago, when the whole
inscription could be read, we visited the spot in April, 1885, and found
only a small portion left,--a triangular piece, perhaps a foot and a
half high on one side, at the bottom of which we could only make out:
"A.D. 1788, ... the tears of strangers watered her grave." For years,
young persons of a romantic turn of mind have visited the grave and
chipped off small pieces of the freestone for relics. This modern habit
of chipping monumental stones for relics is inexcusable; for it is not
done by ignorant or otherwise lawless persons, but too often by the
educated, who carry their mawkish sentiment to such an extreme as to
deface and sometimes, as in the present case, entirely to ruin a
monument. It is in vain to urge that this was only a stranger's stone,
and that there were none to care. It was all the more an outrage, if
there were no friends to protect it. We are glad to learn that there
were people in the town who did what they could to prevent this
sacrilege.

The following account of this unfortunate lady we take from Hanson's
"History of Danvers:"--

    "Elizabeth Whitman came from a very respectable family in
    Connecticut, where her father was a clergyman. She was
    possessed of an ardent poetical temperament, an inordinate
    love of praise, and was gifted with the natural endowment of
    beauty and perfect grace, while she was accomplished with
    those refinements which education can bestow. She was lovely
    beyond words. But her natural amiabilities were warped and
    perverted by reading great numbers of romances, to the
    exclusion of almost all other reading. She formed her idea
    of men by the exaggerated standards she saw in the books to
    which she resorted; and thus when she looked around her she
    saw no one who realized her ideal. She subsequently became
    intimate with a lawyer, said to be the Honourable (?) Judge
    Pierpont Edwards."

We next hear of her in Danvers, "where the novelty of her situation,"
continues Hanson, "and her attractive beauty and manners during her
short sojourn, caused the entire village and many from the neighboring
towns to attend her funeral. A few weeks after her burial, an unknown
hand erected the gravestone with its eloquent inscription." The stone is
evidently Connecticut sandstone or freestone. Mr. Hanson says of the
volume "Eliza Wharton": "The catchpenny volume of letters which pretend
to give her history has but the figments of the imagination of its
authoress to recommend it."

In these sceptical and agnostic days it may sound a little strange, and
perhaps to some seem quite absurd, that the authorities of Harvard in
1791 felt obliged publicly to deny that Gibbon's History was used as a
text-book at the University. But with the exception perhaps of Tom
Paine, no one in this country had then ventured to assail the literal
interpretation of the Scriptures. Probably the masses of the people
then believed that "Joshua commanded the sun and moon to stand still,
and they obeyed him," that Jonah was swallowed by the whale, and that

    "In Adam's fall,
    We sinned all."

Of course there were exceptions. Therefore, although Gibbon might be an
able writer, it was not safe for young men to study his works, simply
because he had thrown doubt or derision on the Christian miracles. So
when it was reported that a growing liberality of sentiment was being
manifested at Cambridge, and that Gibbon's "Decline and Fall" was to be
used, doubtless no little excitement was roused; and hence the notice.
Before this time doubts concerning many cherished doctrines had been
openly expressed in Boston, Cambridge, Salem, and other places; but
Gibbon had rejected and attacked the whole Christian system as false,
which was a very different matter.

    A WRITER in the CENTINEL of the last _Saturday_, under the
    signature of _Christianus_, says, "that an abridgment of
    GIBBON'S history (if his information be true) is directed

    University." I now beg leave, through the channel of your
    paper, to acquaint that writer, as also the publick, that
    his information is _not true_. The system taught is MILLOT'S
    _Elements_ of _General History, ancient and modern_, and
    GIBBON'S history was never thought of for the purpose.

The character of Boston ladies in 1788 is set forth in a letter in the
"Herald of Freedom." The writer gives his observations on the error of
committing children too much to the care of nurses; also makes reference
to teaching the catechism, etc., showing the value of early religious
training. There can be no doubt, we think, that the old methods were in
some respects superior to the present, where in many cases young
children are left to Sunday-school teachers, or, as is often the case,
receive no religious instruction whatever, for fear, as we have often
heard it stated, that they might imbibe some false doctrinal notions at
an age when the deepest impressions are made.

                          LETTER IX.

     DEAR PIERRE,

    No moments glide away more agreeably than those that are
    employed in writing to a friend. Happy am I in having
    frequent opportunities of exhibiting my sentiments to you,
    and in return receiving yours, which palliates in some
    degree, the sorrow our separation occasions.----The glaring
    absurdities of the dress of the Boston ladies, occupied the
    greatest part of my two last letters. It is but just to say
    something of their more laudable qualities; amongst which,
    maternal affection deservedly claims precedence.--The
    barbarous customs of Europe, in this particular, have not as
    yet, and I hope never will be, practised here. Mothers in
    this country are so much attached to their tender offspring,
    as to forego all the pleasures of life (or rather what are
    so termed in Europe) in attending to their nurture, from
    which they derive the most superlative of all enjoyments,
    the heart-felt satisfaction of having done their duty to
    their God and country, in giving robust, healthy and
    virtuous citizens to the State. The effeminacy of exotic
    fashion has not at present extended its pernicious influence
    so far as to induce them to commit the rearing of their
    children to mercenary nurses, who are sometimes the very
    dregs of a people; and whose vicious habits of taking a drop
    of the _good creature to drown sorrow_, does not promise
    redundancy of health and vigour to those suckled by them--on
    the contrary, children thus unnaturally thrown from the arms
    of a parent into those of a nurse, are, almost without
    exception, weak and puny; of irrascible tempers and vicious
    inclinations.--Nor does the attention of the ladies expire
    with the infancy of their children--they still are unwearied
    in instructing them as they increase in years, and
    assiduously endeavour to inculcate principles of virtue into
    their young minds at a time when they are most liable to
    make a deep impression--to accomplish which, they never fail
    to teach them the catechism, Lord's prayer, &c. &c. all of
    which they oblige them to learn, because they are perfectly
    adapted to their comprehension, though many parts of the
    catechism are altogether incomprehensible to most
    adults.--Yet this is not strange to those who credit the
    scriptures; nor does it appear the least inconsistent--for
    there it says, "God hath chosen the foolish things of this
    world to confound the wise."--Therefore, the wonder that
    children should be able to _understand_ that, which is the
    _foundation_ of all polemical divinity, vanishes, when we
    try it by the touchstone of scripture, which is the
    criterion by which we ought to judge.--When they are thus
    instructed in the rudiments of virtue, they are seldom known
    to apostatize; so that for a native to become dissolute and
    abandoned, is very rare.--Indeed they have characters of
    this kind who emigrate from old countries; but they soon
    find employment for such gentry, by obliging them to labour
    for the publick good, and "work out their salvation by the
    sweat of their brow."--Thus the community is not only
    delivered from such pests, but experience beneficial effects
    from their confinement. Knavery, though rarely found in a
    native, is not entirely extirpated from the breasts of some
    among them.

Remarkable instances of longevity.

    LONGEVITY. Mafeus, who wrote the history of the Indies,
    which has always been a model of veracity as well as elegant
    composition, mentions a native of Bengal, named Numas de
    Cugna, who died 1566, at the age of 370. He was a man of
    great simplicity and quite illiterate; but of so extensive a
    memory, that he was a kind of living chronicle, relating
    distinctly and exactly what had happened within his
    knowledge in the compass of his life, together with all the
    circumstances attending it. He had four new sets of teeth;
    and the color of his hair and beard had been very
    frequently changed from black to grey, and from grey to

    another Portuguese author, Ferdinand Lopez Casteguedo, who
    was historiographer royal.

    What renders the last part of her life remarkable, is, that

                     DINNER IN "OLD TIMES."

It was an old custom in New England to begin dinner with pudding instead
of soup. Many persons of the last generation may remember, as the writer
distinctly does, seeing old people who still adhered to this practice as
late certainly as from 1850 to 1860. The writer was once at a dinner
where all the family began with soup except the father, a gentleman of
the old school, who had a piece cut from a fresh-baked plum-pudding. He
remarked to the company that such had always been his practice; and so
he excused himself for keeping to his own fashion of dining. The custom
of eating pudding before meat is still very common in Yorkshire,
England. The following extract from a Boston paper of 1819 shows that
John Adams, in 1817, kept up the old style of dinner, which, as might
perhaps be imagined, was not confined to the common people, so called.

In "old times" it was customary to say to children, "Those who eat the
most pudding shall have the most meat."

                          PRESIDENT ADAMS.

    The ex-president is a handsome old gentleman of eighty-four;
    his lady is seventy-six: she has the reputation of superior
    talents, and great literary acquirements. I was not
    perfectly a stranger here, as a few days previous to this I
    had received the honor of an hospitable reception at their
    mansion. Upon the present occasion the minister (the day
    being Sunday) was of the dinner party. As a table of a
    "_late king_" may amuse some of you, take the following
    particulars:--first course, a pudding made of Indian corn,
    molasses and butter;--second, veal, bacon, neck of mutton,
    potatoes, cabbages, carrots, and Indian beans; Madeira wine,
    of which each drank two glasses. We sat down to dinner at
    one o'clock; at two, nearly all went a second time to
    church. For tea, we had pound cake, sweet bread and butter,
    and bread made of Indian corn and rye, similar to our brown
    home-made. Tea was brought from the kitchen, and handed
    round by a neat white servant girl.

    The establishment of this political patriarch consists of a
    house two stories high, containing, I believe, eight rooms;
    of two men and three maid servants; three horses and a plain
    carriage. How great is the contrast between this individual,
    a man of knowledge and information--without pomp, parade,
    vitious and expensive establishments, as compared with the
    costly trappings, the depraved characters, and the
    profligate expenditure of ---- House, and ----! What a
    lesson _in this_ does America teach! There are now in this
    land no less than three Cincinnati!

    Hogs in New York streets.

    Yesterday forenoon, while in Broadway, we witnessed another
    instance of the impropriety of suffering Hogs to run at
    large in our streets. A highly respectable and most worthy
    young lady, was literally run down by a large Hog that was
    pursued by a dog. In her fall, her breast struck the curb
    stone, and she was considerably injured. After she had
    partially recovered, the gentleman at whose store she had
    made some purchases, kindly conveyed her to her father's
    house in a carriage. The reader may easily imagine the
    distressing effect produced on the mind of a fond parent, at
    the sight of a darling child, whose pale cheeks plainly
    indicated her situation. --> _What would not the citizens of
    Boston say of their Police, if Hogs were permitted to run
    loose in the streets_?

    SPECIMENS _of the_ IGNORANCE _and_ BLUNDERS _of_ English
    Geographers, Tourists, _&c. &c. with respect to_ AMERICA.

    THE Rev. R. Turner, who has published a book called
    Classical Geography, gives the following account of the
    cities of Philadelphia and Newyork. "Philadelphia, (says he)
    is the finest and _best situated_ city in America,
    containing _thirty thousand_ houses and one hundred and
    twenty thousand inhabitants, who are mostly
    quakers!!!"--"Newyork contains three thousand houses and
    twelve thousand inhabitants!"

    Another book, intitled Guthrie's improved Geography, after
    setting forth in the preface that their (the Editors)
    relation of America, will be found both satisfactory and
    complete, as they have not only carefully examined the works
    of the celebrated Morse, but likewise applied to several
    other authentic sources, which have enabled them to give the
    best information in the most satisfactory manner, states
    that "the city of Newyork contains five thousand
    inhabitants, chiefly of Dutch extraction." Here is pretty
    strong evidence of the diligence of these London bookmakers,
    as to applying to the most authentic sources of information,
    as they profess to have done. An imposition of this kind in
    any American publication, would afford a fine opportunity
    for an English Reviewer to rail against our national
    honesty.

    The very last edition of Guthrie's original work, describing
    the river Hudson, states that this river is navigable to
    Albany, which is "_six hundred miles from Newyork_."

    An English Tourist, whose name is not just now recollected,
    has published a volume of his travels through the United
    States, in which he speaks particularly of the orderly
    manner in which Elections are conducted in the city of
    Newyork. "On the appointed day, says he, all the citizens
    take care to be at home at a certain hour, at which time the
    inspectors of the election go through the city with ballot
    boxes in their hands, and call at every door for votes,
    whereupon the citizens step to their doors and deposit
    their ballots in these same small boxes, which are
    straightway carried to the City Hall; the votes are there
    examined, and thus the election is determined in a few
    hours, without uproar or inconvenience!!!"

    An English Editor of a work, called the _German Museum_, in
    his translation of some memoirs of Major Andre, records,
    that this unfortunate officer was taken and hanged "_at the
    west point of America_."

    A London paper some time ago made mention of certain
    improvements which were taking place in Newyork, with a view
    to promote the health of the city, and observed that our
    corporation were erecting a range of permanent wharves on
    one side of the city, which were to extend from Corlear's
    Hook to the Battery _along the Delaware River_!

           _From a very rare volume of old Poetry._

    The fountaines smoake, and yet no flame they shewe;
      Starres shine all night though undeserned by daye;
    And trees do spring yet are not seen to growe;
      And shadowes move although they seem to staye;
    In winters woe is buried summers bliss,
    And love loves most, when love most secret is.

    The stillest streame descries the greatest deepe;
      The clearest skye is subject to a shower;
    Conceit's most sweete, when as it seems to sleepe;
      And fairest dayes do in the morning lower:
    The silent groves, sweete nymphes theye cannot misse,
    For love loves most, when love most secret is.

    The rarest jewels hidden virtue yield.
      The sweete of traffique is a secret game;
    The yeere once old doth show a barren field
      And plants seeme dead, and yet they spring again.
    Cupid is blind; the reason why, is this,
    Love loveth most, when love most secret is.

    choice of rank or mind & with whom the subjects of
    conversation are only horses, drinking matches, bawdy
    houses, and in terms the most vulgar. The young nobility,
    who begin by associating with him, soon leave him disgusted
    with the insupportable profligacy of his society; and Mr.
    Fox, who has been supposed his favorite, and not over nice
    in the choice of his company, would never keep his company
    habitually.

President Stiles of Yale College on the public revenue.

       _Extract from President STILES's Election Sermon._


    BUT I pass on to another subject in which the welfare of a
    community is deeply concerned, I mean the publick
    _revenues_. National character and national faith depend on
    these. Every people, every large community is able to
    furnish a revenue adequate to the exigences of government.
    But this is a most difficult subject; and what the happiest
    method of raising it, is uncertain. One thing is certain,
    that however in most kingdoms and empires the people are
    taxed at the will of the prince, yet in _America_, the
    people tax themselves, and _therefore cannot tax themselves
    beyond their abilities_. But whether the power of taxing be
    in an absolute monarchy, a power independent of the people,
    or in a body elected by the people, one great error has, I
    apprehend, entered into the system of Revenue and Finance in
    almost all nations, viz. restricting the collection to
    money. Two or three millions can more easily be raised in
    produce, than one million in money. This collected and
    deposited in stores and magazines, would, by bills drawn
    upon these stores, answer all the expenditures of war and
    peace. In one country it has been tried with success for
    ages; I mean in _China_, the wisest empire the sun hath ever
    shined upon. And here, if I recollect aright, not a tenth of
    the Imperial revenues hath been collected in money. In rice,
    wheat and millet only are collected 40 millions of sacks, of
    one hundred and twenty pounds each, equal to 80 million
    bushels; in raw and wrought silk one million pounds. The
    rest is taken in salt, wines, cotton, and other fruits of
    labour and industry, at a certain ratio per cent. and
    deposited in stores over all the empire. The perishable
    commodities are immediately sold, and the Mandarins and army
    are paid by bills on these magazines. In no part of the
    world are the inhabitants less oppressed than there.

Meaning of the word.

    GENTLEMEN. How the signification of words alter in the
    course of a century. There was a time when all persons in
    England, below the rank of an _Esquire_, were divided into
    _Gentlemen_, Yeomen and _Rascals_. The former word is now
    used to signify the individuals of the first order--those
    whom you would take by the hand in the street, and sup with
    of an evening. The second term retains pretty nearly its
    original meaning. But to make an application of the latter
    appellative at this time, would operate as an invitation to
    be knocked down. 'Gentlemen,' is used in opposition among
    the old chronicles to 'simple man,' and neither in any very
    exalted sense. It is on record, that the French Princess, De
    La Roche Sur Yon, receiving a sharp reply from a Knight, to
    whom she gave the epithet of '_Gentilhomme_,' was told by
    the King, to whom she complained, that she deserved all she
    got, for so offending, herself, in the first instance. The
    lower people in England were commonly '_the
    Rascality_'--equivalent to the '_Canaille_' of the French,
    or our own significant _Rabble_ of the present day.

    In what sense do they use the word 'Gentlemen' in
    Congress--Eh?--_Charleston Gaz._

             _Professional_ ANECDOTE _of Dr._ FRANKLIN.

    WHEN he came to Philadelphia, in 1723, he was first employed
    by one Keimer, an eccentric genius, as a pressman, for he
    was then printing an elegy of his own composition, on the
    death of Aisquila Rose--and as he had but one small font of
    types, and used no copy, but composed the elegy in the
    press, he could not employ him in the composition. Keimer
    was a visionary, whose mind was frequently elevated above
    the little concerns of life, and consequently very subject
    to make mistakes, which he seldom took the pains to correct.
    Franklin had frequently reasoned with him upon the
    importance of accuracy in his profession, but in vain. His
    fertile head however soon furnished him with an opportunity
    to second his arguments by proof.--They soon after undertook
    an impression of a primer that had been lately published in
    New-England.--Franklin overlooked the piece; and when his
    master had set the following couplet--

Launching of the "Grand Turk."

    Thursday last being a very pleasant day, great numbers of
    people assembled to see the launching of the large and
    beautiful ship from Mr. DERBY'S wharf. They were, however,
    disappointed in the pleasure they expected, by her stopping
    when she had run about half her length: and all the efforts
    which could be made were ineffectual in getting her off at
    that time: the next day, however, with the aid of proper
    apparatus, and the assistance of the people assembled, she
    was again put in motion, and gained the water.--The name of
    _The Grand Turk_ is revived in this ship, heretofore borne
    by a ship belonging to Mr. DERBY, remarkably successful as a
    privateer in the late war, and which was some time since
    sold in India.

    The ingenious Mr. ENOS BRIGGS, from the North River, was the
    master-builder of the new ship Grand Turk.


                              A CARD.

    _Mr._ E.H. DERBY _requests his fellow-townsmen and others,
    to accept his sincere thanks for their ready and unwearied
    exertions to enable him to complete the launching of his
    Ship._                                           MAY 21.


    Mr. CUSHING,

    The following lines were addressed to the Ship GRAND TURK,
    while launching. They are at your service.

                      Your's,                        Z.

    _The swelling waves roll joyfully along,
    To greet thee, welcome to the azure main;
    The gaping multitude in anxious throng,
    Their ardent--vacant--tumult--scarce restrain._

    _Slow o'er the lubrick ways--immense--you move,
    High o'er the stern your flowing honours stand,
    In distant climes, on unknown seas to prove
    The matchless glory of your native land._

    _For thee--the lofty Cedar nods alone,
    The sturdy Oak its honours lopp'd deplores,
    The forest mourns its tallest beauties gone
    To waft Columbian treasure--to the Indian shores._

    _Doom'd to resist the rage of warring waves,
    Whilst rushing winds impel your foaming way:
    The firm built sides their utmost fury brave.
    The tempest mock--and in the whirlwind play._

    _Safe may you reach your distant--destin'd port,
    Nor rocks--nor treach'rous sands--oppose your fame,
    May gentle winds your swelling topsails court,
    And thousands shout you welcome home again._

Irish Litany.

                        DUBLIN, May 11.

            _To the Printers of the_ Rights _of_ Irishmen.

    GENTLEMEN,

    I am enabled by an invisible power to communicate to you, a
    Litany sanctioned by me, and to be adopted by the
    professors of the patriotic religion of Ireland; a Litany
    which breathes the spirit of that freedom which I professed
    when on earth, and has been here on eternal record; if its
    principle and doctrine tend to enlighten and emancipate your
    country, it will add (if possible) to that indescribable
    happiness enjoyed by him, whom, without vanity, I may now
    call the virtuous and patriotic

                                                       MIRABEAU.

    _Elysium, 5th Feb._ 1792.

                        _THE LITANY._

    1st. Let there be a free, equal, and general representation
    of your people in Parliament.

                             And all the people shall say amen.

    2d. Let there be a reform of your church, an abolition of
    tithes, and let each sect maintain its own pastor.

                                                   And all, &c.

    3d. Let the people of my terrestrial country be an example
    to your people, and let their freedom be your freedom.

                                                   And all, &c.

    4th. Let the fetters which the nobles of your land have
    forged, be broken asunder; and let those who earn,
    distribute the bread of Ireland.

                                                   And all, &c.

    5th. Let each man freely worship God according to the
    dictates of his conscience.

                                                   And all, &c.

    6th. Let christians be philosophers, and let philosophers be
    christians.

                                                   And all, &c.

    7th. Let the rich few no longer be supported by taxes on the
    many and unrepresented poor.

                                                   And all, &c.

    8th. Let all the sons of Hibernia be free--yea, even as free
    as the negroes[D] of Africa.

                                                   And all, &c.

    9th. Let truth never be deemed a libel, and let the Liberty
    of your Press be extended.

                                                   And all, &c.

    10th. Let the noble (tho enlisted) sons of Ireland never
    become the hired assassins of their countrymen.

                                                   And all, &c.

    11th. Let the army which eats the bread of Ireland, be her
    guardian and protector, and not the base invader of her
    rights and liberties.

                                                   And all, &c.

    12th. Let him who first proposed a mortgage on the revenues
    of Ireland, be accursed in the annals of your country.

                                                   And all, &c.

    13th. Let yourselves no longer be the slaves of religion, or
    sect, or party, but the united sons of freedom and
    philosophy.

                                                   And all, &c.

    14th. Let the majesty of your king reflect the majesty of
    your people.

                                                   And all, &c.

The novels of 1833; from the "Salem Observer," July 13.

    The decidedly bad moral tendency of some of the most popular
    novels of the times is forcibly depicted in a magazine
    recently established in England, by two of the sons of
    William Cobbett, in the following language:--

    "Would you seduce a wife? Falkland shall teach you to do it
    with gravity and dignity. Would you murder? Eugene Aram
    shall show you its necessity for the public advantage. Would
    you rob? Paul Clifford shall convince you of the injustice
    of security, and of the abominableness of the safety of a
    purse on a moonlight night.--Would you eat? Turn to Harry
    Bertram and Dandy Dinmont to the round of beef. Would you
    drink? Friar Tuck is the jolliest of companions. Would you
    dance, dress, and drawl? Pelham shall take you into tuition.
    Would you lie, fawn, and flatter? Andrew Wylie shall
    instruct you to crawl upward, without the slime betraying
    your path. Would you yawn, doze, sleep, or dream? Cloudesly
    shall do it for you, for the space of the first volume."

                           THOMAS MOORE.

    Hostile feelings to the Americans having been imputed to the
    poet MOORE in the first number of the (London) Westminster
    Review, the following paragraph appeared in the London Times
    of the 4th Feb., 1824.

    "In the first number of the Westminster Review, just
    published, there is an article upon a late work of Mr.
    Moore's, in which the writer says, 'Mr. Moore has resided in
    America, and, we understand, speaks of the Americans with
    unbounded dislike and contempt.' In this assertion we can
    confidently state, the writer is entirely mistaken. Whatever
    opinions Mr. Moore may have hastily formed, when a very
    young man, with respect to the character and institutions of
    the Americans, we know that he has long since learned to
    correct them, and to feel towards that people all the
    admiration and respect which the noble example they set to
    the other nations of the world demands."

    OLD TIMES.--Mr. Thatcher stated, in his Lecture before the
    Boston Lyceum, that the Old Latin School in this City was
    commenced two hundred years ago, according to the records of
    the Town, which begin at the same year. For a long time it
    was the only school; and there was no writing school among
    us until November, 1684, (just 150 years since.) Master
    Cheever presided over the Latin 38 years, till he died at
    93. He was the teacher of two of the Mathers, and the second
    Doctor said of him in an obituary essay, with his own
    peculiar felicity, that

                      ----to vast age he grew,
        _Till Time's scythe waiting for him rusty grew._

    Lovell was his second successor, and held on 92 years, till
    in 1776 he left the town a Loyalist. The old gentleman had a
    house furnished for him in School street, and a garden that
    reached nearly to Court street, which his best boys were
    allowed to till; and they had also the privilege as a reward
    of merit of sawing his wood and bottling his cider.--The
    Lecturer remarked that this was the first manual labor
    school he had heard of.

    LITERARY CURIOSITY. The following letter was written by a
    young gentleman to his "lady love," under the direction and
    eye of a rigid old father. The understanding, however,
    between the lovers, was, that she should read only every
    other line, beginning with the first. Love is full of
    expedients.

    MADAM,--

    The great love I have hitherto expressed for you
    _is false, and I find that my indifference, toward you_
    increases daily; the more I see of you, the more
    _you appear in my eyes an object of contempt._--
    I feel myself every way disposed and determined to
    _hate you. Believe me, I never had an intention to_
    offer you my hand. Our last conversation has
    _left a tedious insipidity, which has by no means_
    given me the most exalted idea of your character;
    _your temper would make me extremely unhappy,_
    and if we are united, I shall experience nothing but
    _the hatred of my parents, added to their everlasting dis-_
    pleasure in living with you. I have, indeed, a heart
    _to bestow, but I do not wish you to imagine it is_
    at your service; I could not give it to any one more
    _inconsistent and capricious than yourself, and less_
    capable to do honor to my choice and to my family.--
    _Yes, Madam, I trust you will be persuaded that_
    I speak sincerely; and you will do me a favor
    _to avoid me. I shall excuse your taking the trouble_
    to answer this. Your letters are always full of
    _impertinence, and you have not the least shadow of_
    wit or good sense. Adieu! Adieu! believe me, I am
    _so averse to you that it is impossible for me ever to be_
    your affectionate friend and ardent lover.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
