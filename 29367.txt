HUMPTY DUMPTY'S LITTLE SON.


    "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
    Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
    All the King's horses, and all the King's men,
    Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again."


After Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall and all the King's horses and all
the King's men could not put him together again, Little Dumpty
lived with his Mother, who was called Widow Dumpty, and went to school
every day. He set off in good time every morning--even if it was
_pouring_ with rain. He had a great many friends at school, and the boys
liked him because he always had plenty of marbles, and used to carry
sticky labels in his pocket; he got them out of his Mother's shop, and
gave them as prizes for racing and jumping in play time.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


Little Dumpty was a little bit like a _nice_ goblin, it was therefore
very interesting to his school fellows to have him for a chum, and the
funny part about him was that he never took his hat off. Of course no
one said anything about it, but they just remembered that his Father
was an egg, and got cracked and broken, and they thought that had
something to do with it.

Well, I will tell you how Little Dumpty used to spend his time. In
summer he used to get up quite early, because he had to feed his pets
before breakfast. He had a lot of pets in the yard at the back of the
house. He had guinea-pigs, of course, then he had three rabbits and a
pair of dormice and a canary; and he had some pigeons. They were rather
a bother to him, because they had a nasty habit of flying down the
parlour chimney, where sometimes they stuck for two or three days, and
at last flew out all black and sooty into the room. Widow Dumpty
used to be rather angry and spoke crossly when this happened, and then
Little Dumpty used to get up and go out and feed his rabbits, which is
what he generally did when he wasn't very happy. Well, then he had a
tame hen and some silkworms. Once he had a baby chicken, but it ate some
blue chalk, which Dumpty had dropped on the ground, and died. He did
all he could to keep it alive but it was no good. He was very sorry
about it, because he had often longed for a little chicken of his own;
besides his Mother had told him that when it grew up it would be a
swimming chicken. It was a pity too he dropped the chalk, because it got
trodden on and spoilt, and it had been his favourite chalk.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


Well, as I was saying, first he had to feed his pets and to water his
garden before the sun got too hot: and by then it was time for
breakfast. He and his Mother were always very happy at breakfast (except
when there was a pigeon in the chimney). Generally they talked about the
garden, and when the seeds were coming up Widow Dumpty used to send
Little Dumpty running out to chivvy off the sparrows and starlings who
wanted to eat all the young sprouts. In the spring they talked about
tadpoles, and wondered how long it would be before they lost their
tails; and in the summer time they wondered when Little Dumpty would
get a bath; and in the autumn they talked about the circus which was
coming; and in the winter about their "poetry" which they made up, or
about the bulbs in the pots at the window, which always looked like
blooming for Christmas, and never _did_ bloom till March. Oh, and lots
of other things!


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


Little Dumpty generally had bread and milk for breakfast and finished
up with honey--for Mrs. Dumpty kept dear little bees in her garden, so
there was always plenty of that:--but on Sundays Dumpty had a poached
egg for breakfast, for a treat. When he'd done his breakfast Dumpty used
to have to look sharp and open the shop for his Mother and sweep the
step, and by then it was time for school, so he got his books together
and trotted off.

He used always to meet his "chum" on the way; _his_ name was Binkie, and
he lived with his father at the Blacksmith's--his father _was_ the
Blacksmith, and there was no Mrs. Blacksmith because she was dead, but
Binkie's aunt, who was a very kind lady, used to take care of Binkie;
_her_ name was Miss Amelia Bloater.

Well, every morning Binkie and Dumpty trudged off to school together.
Dumpty's favourite lesson was writing, he simply _loved_ doing copies,
and once he got a prize for writing; he was quite delighted about it,
and often wished he could get another, and after being at school four
years, at last he did--that was for scripture.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


Dumpty used to stay at school all day and had dinner with the big boys;
in the afternoon there was "prep," and at four o'clock school was over
and all the boys were jolly glad.

On his way home from school Dumpty used to stop and get cow-parsley for
his rabbits, and when silkworms were "in" he used to have to go into
Binkie's garden to get mulberry leaves, because Binkie's father had a
mulberry tree in his garden and Dumpty's Mother hadn't. One day when
Dumpty got in from school he found that a horrid great rat had got into
the empty hutch where he kept all his grain for feeding his pets and had
eaten it all and bitten one of the baby pigeons! He was so sad about
it--but Binkie's father soon brought in his dogs and they caught the
nasty rat. Dumpty's Mother often said she didn't know what she would do
without her kind neighbour the Blacksmith.

Well, by the time Master Dumpty got in from school it was pretty well
tea time, and in the summer he and his Mother often had it in the
garden, not _too_ far from the house, so that if anyone came into the
shop they could hear, that is to say they _might_ hear if he banged on
the counter loud, or shut the shop door with a slam;--then Dumpty would
run fast and serve in the shop for his Mother. Sometimes the customers
were such a long time choosing a peppermint stick or a few glass
beads that Dumpty thought he should never get back to his tea;--and they
had radishes and lettuce out of their own garden. And directly after tea
Little Dumpty did _just_ what he liked till bed-time.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


I must tell you now about the things Little Dumpty _did_ like: there
were lots of things, and he liked them all in turn.

One thing he loved was ponding, which began as soon as the days were
warm enough. He used to go with a net and a little tin pail and catch
all kinds of fish and little insects out of the pond and put them in his
aquarium, but he called it his "acquair." His "acquair" was a glass
bell stood on its end and filled at the bottom with sand, and on top
with water for the things to swim about in. Minnows, and sometimes
sticklebats (but not _generally_ sticklebats, because, though they
looked nice they used to eat up the other things so), and of course
tadpoles (when they were "in") and water-snails with pointed shells and
caddis-worms and water boatmen, and "little reddies"--oh! and anything
he caught in his net. Little Dumpty used to bring them all home in his
pail and keep them in the "acquair."

That's what Little Dumpty and his Mother used to talk about at
breakfast, "how long before the tadpoles lost their tails."


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


Once when Mrs. Dumpty went away to see a sick friend and Dumpty was
left all to himself he thought he would have a lovely acquair in the
middle of his own garden, just like a real pond, so he dug a big hole
and planted ferns round it, and then he got a big bath and put it in the
hole he had dug, and filled it with water; and it looked grand, and
Dumpty thought some rocks in the middle of the pond would look grander
still, so he got some clinkers and with great trouble managed to push
them right out to the middle, he was just putting in the last one when
he toppled and fell splash-bash right into the water. He was in an awful
mess when he got out! And his Mother, who came home just at that minute,
was very angry with him. Poor Little Dumpty was very sad and ashamed of
himself.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


The CIRCUS always came to Eggy in the autumn, and as Little Dumpty's
birthday was on October 31st his Mother always let him go to it for a
birthday treat. He and Binkie used to go together. It was lovely fun
first of all to go round by the tents and see the men getting ready for
the Show. Little Dumpty felt that he knew quite a lot of what went on
behind the scenes, for one day a man who was putting up the tents let
him hold his hammer for him. Dumpty saw him afterwards playing in the
band and gave him a little nod, but the man was too busy to see him. It
disappointed Dumpty rather. The Circus was always a treat, but the
best part was when the clown with the performing pony said, "Now
Topsy"--that was the pony's name--"you just show me who you think would
make the finest soldier in all this audience," and the pony ran straight
across the ring and nodded its head at Dumpty! It pleased him, because
Dumpty always said he was going to be a soldier when he grew up, and he
often played at being one. That pony knew lots of things, it could say
what the time was, and could tell how many of the Kings of England had
been named Edward, but when the clown asked the pony "who was the
butcher's sweetheart?" Topsy made a great mistake and all the people
laughed, for he went and nodded at Binkie's grown-up sister, and she had
_always_ promised to marry Dumpty when he was big enough.

But I think Little Dumpty liked the winter evenings best of all, when he
and his Mother were so cosy in the little kitchen at the back of the
shop. They used to have great games together. Dumpty had his own
circus, and gave grand performances to his Mother. She used to sit in
the "Royal Box" (which was the corner with a shawl round it, and a
cushion for her feet). She dressed him a little doll, who was master of
the ring, and he had lots of animals in his procession. Two elephants
and a bear on hind legs, and a bear on four legs, a zebra, a tiger,
a big squirrel, some tin horses, and some lovely horses covered with
real hair, a set of performing frogs, and oh! heaps more.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


Then for the performance he would sing, and recite the pieces of poetry
which he and his Mother had made up (that's what I told you they talked
about at breakfast). For instance, there were two geese in a pen which
you wound up, and Dumpty would put on a quackie voice and say:--


    Some mischief sure will Satan find
      For idle hands--however sweet,
    So in your idle moments wind
      My little geese, and watch them eat.

    And as you wind, this lesson good
      Ma' rag-time geese would teach to thee;
    Never to grab or snatch your food,
      However hungry you may be.


Then he had some performing mice in a cage, with clockwork inside, and
as he wound them up he sang:--


    Oh, three performing mice are we,
    And when you wind us up you see,
    We twirl and twiddle round the cage,
    And play at leap-frog on the stage.
    And when the master of the ring,
    Commands us, we can also sing
    That story sad--though true to life,
    Of Blind Mice, and the Farmer's wife.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


And then Little Dumpty and his mother sang "Three Blind Mice" together,
very slowly and sadly:--


    Three Blind Mice!
      See how they run!
    They all ran after the Farmer's Wife,
      Who cut off their tails with the carving knife,
    Did you ever see such a thing in your life
      As three Blind Mice?


When he got all his horses on the stage (he put the skin ones in front
because they were the loveliest), he used to pretend they danced while
he whistled a tune on the penny whistle.

Then there was a china girl with a parachute; when she was on the stage
Little Dumpty recited the piece called "Isabella's Parachute" out of a
favourite book he had called "Cautionary Stories":--


    Once as little Isabella
    Ventured with a large umbrella,
    Out upon a rainy day
    She was nearly blown away.

    Sadly frightened then was she,
    For 'twas very near the sea,
    And the wind was very high,
    But, alas! no friend was nigh.

    Luckily her good mamma
    Saw her trouble from afar;
    Running just in time, she caught her
    Pretty little flying daughter.


And if he got an encore, which he often did for this piece, for he
_loved_ saying it, he used to tell the story of Robert:--


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


    When the rain comes tumbling down
    In the country or the town,
    All good little girls and boys
    Stay at home and mind their toys.

    Robert thought,--"No, when it pours,
    It is better out of doors."
    Here you see him, silly fellow,
    Underneath his red umbrella.

    Now look at the silly fellow,
    The wind has caught his red umbrella,
    Up he flies to the skies;
    No one hears his screams and cries.

    No one ever yet could tell
    Where he stopped, or where he fell:
    Only, this one thing is plain,
    Bob was never seen again!


And they always used to finish up with the black nigger girl on
horseback:--


    Dis yah am de niggah gal
      Come to say good night,
    Wishin' all de picanninies
      Dreams of fairies bright.
    Wishin' all de niggah boys,
      Plently laugh and fun,
    Wishin' dat this circus game
      Was only jus' begun,
    'Stead of bein' as 'tis now,
    Finished, when I've made my bow.


Then Little Dumpty made her jump up on the bareback horse and bow to his
Mother.

At half-past seven Dumpty had to "prepare," as he said, that is he had
to begin to think about bed, just so that bed-time shouldn't come when
he was in the middle of something _very_ interesting, and at a quarter
to eight he had to go. He gave his Mother a kiss, and often when he
had been very good and happy she gave him an acid drop to suck when he
was in bed.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]


Well, of course there were lots more things Little Dumpty used to do: I
can't tell them all because it would take too long if I were to tell you
all about his chalks and his paints and his stone bricks and his silver
paper ball and his kite--why it would fill ever so many books, but I
_must_ tell you one thing more and that is about his card houses. He was
better at that than at anything, and one night his Mother offered a
prize of a cake of new emerald green paint if he could build eight
houses. And he _did_. He tried ever so many times; and his Mother had
to let him sit up a little later because just as he had got to the sixth
storey safely, safely, after striving very much, the clock struck a
quarter to eight. It would have been too bad to send him off then, when
he longed to do it so. It quite made his fingers tremble to put on the
last card. It was a good thing he succeeded that once, for he never did
it again, and he _did_ want the green paint so!

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
