PREFACE.


The present text-book is a new-modeling and rewriting of Swinton's
_Word-Analysis_, first published in 1871. It has grown out of a large
amount of testimony to the effect that the older book, while valuable as a
manual of methods, in the hands of teachers, is deficient in practice-work
for pupils.

This testimony dictated a double procedure: first, to retain the old
_methods_; secondly, to add an adequate amount of new _matter_.

Accordingly, in the present manual, the few Latin roots and derivatives,
with the exercises thereon, have been retained--under "Part II.: The Latin
Element"--as simply a _method of study_.[1] There have then been added, in
"Division II.: Abbreviated Latin Derivatives," no fewer than two hundred
and twenty Latin root-words with their most important English offshoots. In
order to concentrate into the limited available space so large an amount of
new matter, it was requisite to devise a novel mode of indicating the
English derivatives. What this mode is, teachers will see in the section,
pages 50-104. The author trusts that it will prove well suited to
class-room work, and in many other ways interesting and valuable: should it
not, a good deal of labor, both of the lamp and of the file, will have been
misplaced.

To one matter of detail in connection with the Latin and Greek derivatives,
the author wishes to call special attention: the Latin and the Greek roots
are, as key-words, given in this book in the form of the _present
infinitive_,--the present indicative and the supine being, of course,
added. For this there is one sufficient justification, to wit: that the
present infinitive is the form in which a Latin or a Greek root is always
given in Webster and other received lexicographic authorities. It is a
curious fact, that, in all the school etymologies, the present indicative
should have been given as the root, and is explicable only from the
accident that it is the key-form in the Latin dictionaries. The change into
conformity with our English dictionaries needs no defense, and will
probably hereafter be imitated by all authors of school etymologies.

In this compilation the author has followed, in the main, the last edition
of Webster's Unabridged, the etymologies in which carry the authoritative
sanction of Dr. Mahn; but reference has constantly been had to the works of
Wedgwood, Latham, and Haldeman, as also to the "English Etymology" of Dr.
James Douglass, to whom the author is specially indebted in the Greek and
Anglo-Saxon sections.

WORD-ANALYSIS.




PART I.--INTRODUCTION.


I.--ELEMENTS OF THE ENGLISH VOCABULARY.

1. ETYMOLOGY[2] is the study which treats of the derivation of words,--that
is, of their structure and history.

2. ENGLISH ETYMOLOGY, or word-analysis, treats of the derivation of English
words.

3. The VOCABULARY[3] of a language is the whole body of words in that
language. Hence the English vocabulary consists of all the words in the
English language.

    I. The complete study of any language comprises two distinct
    inquiries,--the study of the _grammar_ of the language, and the study
    of its _vocabulary_. Word-analysis has to do exclusively with the
    vocabulary.

    II. The term "etymology" as used in grammar must be carefully
    distinguished from "etymology" in the sense of word-analysis.
    Grammatical etymology treats solely of the grammatical changes in
    words, and does not concern itself with their derivation; historical
    etymology treats of the structure, composition, and history of words.
    Thus the relation of _loves, loving, loved_ to the verb _love_ is a
    matter of grammatical etymology; but the relation of _lover, lovely_,
    or _loveliness_ to _love_ is a matter of historical etymology.

    III. The English vocabulary is very extensive, as is shown by the fact
    that in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary there are nearly 100,000 words.
    But it should be observed that 3,000 or 4,000 serve all the ordinary
    purposes of oral and written communication. The Old Testament contains
    5,642 words; Milton uses about 8,000; and Shakespeare, whose vocabulary
    is more extensive than that of any other English writer, employs no
    more than 15,000 words.

4. The PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS of the English vocabulary are words of
Anglo-Saxon and of Latin or _French-Latin_ origin.

5. ANGLO-SAXON is the earliest form of English. The whole of the grammar of
our language, and the most largely used part of its vocabulary, are
Anglo-Saxon.

    I. Anglo-Saxon belongs to the Low German[4] division of the Teutonic
    stock of languages. Its relations to the other languages of Europe--all
    of which are classed together as the Aryan, or Indo-European family of
    languages--may be seen from the following table:--

               / CELTIC STOCK..........................as Welsh, Gaelic.
               | SLAVONIC STOCK........................as Russian.
    INDO-      |                / Greek    / Italian.
    EUROPEAN  <  CLASSIC STOCK  \ Latin   <  Spanish.
    FAMILY.    |                           \ French, etc.
               |                / Scandinavian:.......as Swedish.
               | TEUTONIC STOCK<          / High Ger:.as Modern German.
               \                \ German <
                                          \ Low Ger....as Anglo-Saxon.


   II. The term "Anglo-Saxon" is derived from the names _Angles_ and
   _Saxons_, two North German tribes who, in the fifth century A.D.,
   invaded Britain, conquered the native Britons, and possessed themselves
   of the land, which they called England, that is, Angle-land. The Britons
   spoke a Celtic language, best represented by modern Welsh. Some British
   words were adopted into Anglo-Saxon, and still continue in our language.

6. The LATIN element in the English vocabulary consists of a large number
of words of Latin origin, adopted directly into English at various periods.

    The principal periods, during which Latin words were brought directly
    into English are:--

    1. At the introduction of Christianity into England by the Latin
    Catholic missionaries, A.D. 596.

    2. At the revival of classical learning in the sixteenth century.

    3. By modern writers.

7. The FRENCH-LATIN element in the English language consists of French
words, first largely introduced into English by the Norman-French who
conquered England in the eleventh century, A.D.

    I. French, like Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, is substantially
    Latin, but Latin considerably altered by loss of grammatical forms and
    by other changes. This language the Norman-French invaders brought with
    them into England, and they continued to use it for more than two
    centuries after the Conquest. Yet, as they were not so numerous as the
    native population, the old Anglo-Saxon finally prevailed, though with
    an immense infusion of French words.

    II. French-Latin words--that is, Latin words introduced through the
    French--can often be readily distinguished by their being more changed
    in form than the Latin terms directly introduced into our language.
    Thus--

    LATIN.        FRENCH.       ENGLISH.

    inimi'cus     ennemi        enemy
    pop'ulus      peuple        people
    se'nior       sire          sir

8. OTHER ELEMENTS.--In addition to its primary constituents--namely, the
Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and French-Latin--the English vocabulary contains a
large number of Greek derivatives and a considerable number of Italian,
Spanish, and Portuguese words, besides various terms derived from
miscellaneous sources.

    The following are examples of words taken from miscellaneous sources;
    that is, from sources other than Anglo-Saxon, Latin, French-Latin, and
    Greek:--

    _Hebrew_: amen, cherub, jubilee, leviathan, manna, sabbath, seraph.

    _Arabic_: admiral, alcohol, algebra, assassin, camphor, caravan,
    chemistry, cipher, coffee, elixir, gazelle, lemon, magazine, nabob,
    sultan.

    _Turkish_: bey, chibouk, chouse, janissary, kiosk, tulip.

    _Persian_: azure, bazaar, checkmate, chess, cimeter, demijohn, dervise,
    orange, paradise, pasha, turban.

    _Hindustani_: calico, jungle, pariah, punch, rupee, shampoo, toddy.

    _Malay_: a-muck, bamboo, bantam, gamboge, gong, gutta-percha, mango.

    _Chinese_: nankeen, tea.

    _Polynesian_: kangaroo, taboo, tattoo.

    _American Indian_: maize, moccasin, pemmican, potato, tobacco,
    tomahawk, tomato, wigwam.

    _Celtic_: bard, bran, brat, cradle, clan, druid, pony, whiskey.

    _Scandinavian_: by-law, clown, dregs, fellow, glade, hustings, kidnap,
    plough.

    _Dutch, or Hollandish_: block, boom, bowsprit, reef, skates, sloop,
    yacht.

    _Italian_: canto, cupola, gondola, grotto, lava, opera, piano, regatta,
    soprano, stucco, vista.

    _Spanish_: armada, cargo, cigar, desperado, flotilla, grandee,
    mosquito, mulatto, punctilio, sherry, sierra.

    _Portuguese_: caste, commodore, fetish, mandarin, palaver.

9. PROPORTIONS.--On an examination of passages selected from modern English
authors, it is found that of every hundred words sixty are of Anglo-Saxon
origin, thirty of Latin, five of Greek, and all the other sources combined
furnish the remaining five.

    By actual count, there are more words of classical than of Anglo-Saxon
    origin in the English vocabulary,--probably two and a half times as
    many of the former as of the latter. But Anglo-Saxon words are so much
    more employed--owing to the constant repetition of conjunctions,
    prepositions, adverbs, auxiliaries, etc. (all of Anglo-Saxon
    origin)--that in any page of even the most Latinized writer they
    greatly preponderate. In the Bible, and in Shakespeare's vocabulary,
    they are in the proportion of ninety per cent. For specimens showing
    Anglo-Saxon words, see p. 136.


II.--ETYMOLOGICAL CLASSES OF WORDS.

10. CLASSES BY ORIGIN.--With respect to their origin, words are divided
into two classes,--primitive words and derivative words.

11. A PRIMITIVE word, or root, is one that cannot be reduced to a more
simple form in the language to which it is native: as, _man, good, run_.

12. A DERIVATIVE word is one made up of a root and one or more _formative
elements_: as, man_ly_, good_ness_, run_ner_.

The formative elements are called prefixes and suffixes. (See Sec.Sec. 16, 17.)

13. BY COMPOSITION.--With respect to their composition, words are divided
into two classes,--simple and compound words.

14. A SIMPLE word consists of a single significant term: as, _school,
master, rain, bow_.

15. A COMPOUND word is one made up of two or more simple words united: as,
_school-master, rainbow_.

    In some compound words the constituent parts are joined by the hyphen
    as _school-master_; in others the parts coalesce and the compound forms
    a single (though not a _simple_) word, as _rainbow_.

III.--PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES.

16. A prefix is a significant syllable or word placed before and joined
with a word to modify its meaning: as, unsafe = _not_ safe; remove = move
_back_; circumnavigate = sail _around_.

17. A suffix is a significant syllable or syllables placed after and joined
with a word to modify its meaning: as, safeLY = in a safe _manner_; movABLE
= that may be moved; navIGATION = _act_ of sailing.

The word _affix_ signifies either a prefix or a suffix; and the verb _to
affix_ means to join a prefix or a suffix to a root-word.

IV.--RULES OF SPELLING USED IN FORMING DERIVATIVE WORDS.

Rule 1.--_Final "e" followed by a Vowel._

Final _e_ of a primitive word is dropped on taking a suffix beginning with
a vowel: as, blame + able = blamable; guide + ance = guidance; come + ing =
coming; force + ible = forcible; obscure + ity = obscurity.

    EXCEPTION 1.--Words ending in _ge_ or _ce_ usually retain the _e_
    before a suffix beginning with _a_ or _o_, for the reason that _c_ and
    _g_ would have the hard sound if the _e_ were dropped: as, peace + able
    = peaceable; change + able = changeable; courage + ous = courageous.

    EXCEPTION 2.--Words ending in _oe_ retain the _e_ to preserve the sound
    of the root: as, shoe + ing = shoeing; hoe + ing = hoeing. The _e_ is
    retained in a few words to prevent their being confounded with similar
    words: as, singe + ing = singeing (to prevent its being confounded with
    singing).

Rule II.--_Final "e" followed by a Consonant._

Final _e_ of a primitive word is retained on taking a suffix beginning with
a consonant: as, pale + ness = paleness; large + ly = largely.

    EXCEPTION 1.--When the final _e_ is preceded by a vowel, it is
    sometimes omitted; as, due + ly = duly; true + ly = truly; whole + ly =
    wholly.

    EXCEPTION 2.--A few words ending in _e_ drop the _e_ before a suffix
    beginning with a consonant: as, judge + ment = judgment; lodge + ment =
    lodgment; abridge + ment = abridgment.

Rule III.--_Final "y" preceded by a Consonant._

Final _y_ of a primitive word, when preceded by a consonant, is generally
changed into _i_ on the addition of a suffix.

    EXCEPTION 1.--Before _ing_ or _ish_, the final _y_ is retained to
    prevent the doubling of the _i_: as, pity + ing = pitying.

    EXCEPTION 2.--Words ending in _ie_ and dropping the _e_, by Rule I.
    change the _i_ into _y_ to prevent the doubling of the _i_: as, die +
    ing = dying; lie + ing = lying.

    EXCEPTION 3.--Final _y_ is sometimes changed into _e_: as, duty + ous =
    duteous; beauty + ous = beauteous.

Rule IV.--_Final "y" preceded by a Vowel._

Final _y_ of a primitive word, when preceded by a vowel, should not be
changed into an _i_ before a suffix: as, joy + less = joyless.

Rule V.--_Doubling._

Monosyllables and other words accented on the last syllable, when they end
with a single consonant, preceded by a single vowel, or by a vowel after
_qu_, double their final letter before a suffix beginning with a vowel: as,
rob + ed = robbed; fop + ish = foppish; squat + er = squatter; prefer' +
ing = prefer'ring.

    EXCEPTIONS.--_X_ final, being equivalent to _ks_, is never doubled; and
    when the derivative does not retain the accent of the root, the final
    consonant is not always doubled: as, prefer' + ence = pref'erence.

Rule VI.--_No Doubling._

A final consonant, when it is not preceded by a single vowel, or when the
accent is not on the last syllable, should remain single before an
additional syllable: as, toil + ing = tolling; cheat + ed = cheated; murmur
+ ing = murmuring.




PART II.--THE LATIN ELEMENT.


I.--LATIN PREFIXES.

Prefix.    Signification.    Example.           Definition.

A-                           a-vert             to turn _from_.
ab-        = _from_          ab-solve           to release _from_.
abs-                         abs-tain           to hold _from_.

AD-                          ad-here            to stick _to_.
a-                           a-gree             to be pleasing _to_.
ac-                          ac-cede            to yield _to_.
af-                          af-fix             to fix _to_.
ag-                          ag-grieve          to give pain _to_.
al-        = _to_            al-ly              to bind _to_.
an-                          an-nex             to tie _to_.
ap-                          ap-pend            to hang _to_.
ar-                          ar-rive            to reach _to_.
as-                          as-sent            to yield _to_.

NOTE.--The forms AC-, AF-, etc., are euphonic variations of AD-, and follow
generally the rule that the final consonant of the prefix assimilates to
the initial letter of the root.

III.--DIRECTIONS IN THE STUDY OF LATIN DERIVATIVES.

1. A LATIN PRIMITIVE, or root, is a Latin word from which a certain number
of English derivative words is formed. Thus the Latin verb _du'cere_, to
draw or lead, is a Latin primitive or root, and from it are formed _educe_,
_education_, _deduction_, _ductile_, _reproductive_, and several hundred
other English words.

2. LATIN ROOTS consist chiefly of verbs, nouns, and adjectives.

3. ENGLISH DERIVATIVES from Latin words are generally formed not from the
root itself but from a part of the root called the _radical_. Thus, in the
word "education," the _root-word_ is _ducere_, but the _radical_ is DUC-
(education = e + DUC + ate + ion).

4. A RADICAL is a word or a part of a word used in forming English
derivatives.

5. Sometimes several radicals from the same root-word are used, the
different radicals being taken from different grammatical forms of the
root-word.

6. VERB-RADICALS are formed principally from two parts of the verb,--the
first person singular of the present indicative, and a part called the
_supine_, which is a verbal noun corresponding to the English infinitive in
-ing. Thus:--

  _1st pers. sing. pres. ind._    duco (I draw)
  _Root_                          DUC-
  _Derivative_                    _educe_
  _Supine_                        ductum (drawing, or to draw)
  _Root_                          DUCT-
  _Derivative_                    _ductile_

I. In giving a Latin verb-primitive in this book three "principal parts" of
the verb will be given, namely: (1) The present infinitive, (2) the first
person singular of the present indicative, and (3) the supine--the second
and the third parts because from them radicals are obtained, and the
infinitive because this is the part used in naming a verb in a general way.
Thus as we say that _loved_, _loving_, etc., are parts of the verb "to
love," so we say that _a'mo_ (present ind.) and _ama'tum_ (supine) are
parts of the verb _ama're_.

II. It should be noted that it is incorrect to translate _amo_, _amatum_,
by "to love," since neither of these words is in the infinitive mood, which
is _amare_. The indication of the Latin infinitive will be found of great
utility, as it is the part by which a Latin verb is referred to in the
Dictionary.

7. NOUN-RADICALS and ADJECTIVE RADICALS are formed from the nominative and
from the genitive (or possessive) case of words belonging to these parts of
speech. Thus:--

NOM. CASE.                              ROOT.       DERIVATIVE.
iter (a journey)                        ITER-.      re_iter_ate

GEN. CASE.                              ROOT        DERIVATIVE.
itineris (of a journey)                 ITINER-     _itiner_ant
felicis (nom. _felix_, happy)           FELIC-      _felic_ity

    NOTE.--These explanations of the mode of forming radicals are given by
    way of general information; but this book presupposes and requires no
    knowledge of Latin, since in every group of English derivatives from
    Latin, not only the root-words in their several parts, but the
    _radicals actually used_ in word-formation, are given.

Pronunciation of Latin Words.

1. Every word in Latin must have as many syllables as it has vowels or
diphthongs: as _miles_ (= _mi'les_).

2. _C_ is pronounced like _k_ before _a_, _o_, _u_; and like _s_ before
_e_, _i_, _y_, and the diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_: as _cado_, pronounced
_ka'do_; _cedo_, pronounced _se'do_.

3. _G_ is pronounced hard before _a_, _o_, _u_, and soft like _j_ before
_e_, _i_, _y_, _ae_, _oe_: as _gusto_, in which _g_ is pronounced as in
_August_; _gero_, pronounced _je'ro_.

4. A consonant between two vowels must be joined to the latter: as _bene_,
pronounced _be'ne_.

5. Two consonants in the middle of a word must be divided: as _mille_,
pronounced _mil'le_.

6. The diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_ are sounded like _e_: as _caedo_, pronounced
_ce'do_.

7. Words of two syllables are accented on the first: as _ager_, pronounced
_a'jer_.

8. When a word of more than one syllable ends in _a_, the _a_ should be
sounded like _ah_: as _musa_, pronounced _mu'sah_.

9. _T_, _s_, and _c_, before _ia_, _ie_, _ii_, _io_, _iu_, and _eu_,
preceded immediately by the accent, in Latin words as in English, change
into _sh_ and _zh_: as _fa'cio_, pronounced _fa'sheo_; _san'cio_,
pronounced _san'sheo_; _spa'tium_, pronounced _spa'sheum_.

    NOTE.--According to the Roman method of pronouncing Latin, the vowels
    _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_ are pronounced as in _baa_, _bait_, _beet_,
    _boat_, _boot_; _ae_, _au_, _ei_, _oe_ as in _aisle_, _our_, _eight_,
    _oil_; _c_ always like _k_; _g_ as in _get_; _j_ as _y_ in _yes_; _t_
    as in _until_; _v_ as _w_. See any Latin grammar.




LATIN ROOTS AND ENGLISH DERIVATIVES.


DIVISION I.--METHOD OF STUDY.


1. AG'ERE: a'go, ac'tum, _to do_, _to drive_.

Radicals: AG- and ACT-.

1. ACT, _v._ ANALYSIS: from _actum_ by dropping the termination _um_.
DEFINITION: to do, to perform. The _noun_ "act" is formed in the same way.
DEFINITION: a thing done, a deed or performance.

2. AC'TION: act + ion = the act of doing: hence, a thing done.

3. ACT'IVE: act + ive = having the quality of acting: hence, busy,
constantly engaged in action.

4. ACT'OR: act + or = one who acts: hence, (1) one who takes part in
anything done; (2) a stage player.

5. A'GENT: ag + ent = one who acts: hence, one who acts or transacts
business for another.

6. AG'ILE: ag + ile = apt to act: hence, nimble, brisk.

7. CO'GENT: from Latin _cogens_, _cogentis_, pres. part, of _cog'ere_ (=
_co + agere_, to impel), having the quality of impelling: hence, urgent,
forcible.

8. ENACT': en + act = to put in act: hence, to decree.

9. TRANSACT': trans + act = to drive through: hence, to perform.

good-will.

3. AM'ICABLE: amic + able = disposed to be a friend: hence, friendly;

EXERCISE.

_In this and the following exercises, tell the roots of the words printed
in italic_: The _equator_ divides the globe into two _equal_ parts. Good
_agriculturists_ read _agricultural_ papers. In the _primeval_ ages the
_longevity_ of man was very great. The _pilgrims_ have gone on a
_pilgrimage_ to the Holy Land. The _subaltern_ had no _alternative_ but to
obey. To remove the stain a powerful _acid_ must be used. The _alimony_
which had hitherto been allowed was no longer considered _adequate_. The
discourse, though learned, was not _edifying_. God is an _eternal_ and
unchangeable being. The handsome _edifice_ was burned to the ground. The
plants and animals in the _aquarium_ were brought from abroad. Though the
style is _antiquated_, it is not inelegant. The _arbitrary_ proceedings of
the British Parliament _exasperated_ the Americans. God is the _bountiful_
Giver of all good. The President made a short _inaugural_ address. By
_combined_ effort success is sure. One of Scott's novels is called The
_Antiquary_. It is _barbarous_ needlessly to destroy life. George Peabody
was noted for his _benevolence_. The Romans were famous for their great
_aqueducts_.

EXERCISE.

The _decay_ of the tree was caused by the _incisions_ which had
_accidentally_ been made in the bark. The _captives_ will be set at
liberty, but the _precise_ time of their _emancipation_ has not been fixed.
The harbor is _capacious_, and can _receive_ vessels of the largest size.
The merits of the _candidates_ were _discriminated_ with great _candor_. We
were _enchanted_ with the _carnival_ at Rome. This _recitation_ is
satisfactory. Have you ever seen a _centigrade_ thermometer? Nothing is so
_successful_ as _success_. The number of _concentric circles_ in the trunk
marked the age of the tree. No _censer_ round our altar beams. The heat
being _excessive_, we took shelter in the _recesses_ of a _cave_.
_Precision_ is the _principal_ quality of good writing. Franklin's father
was a tallow _chandler_. Last _century_ there was great _carnage_ in
America. _Infanticide_ is much practiced in China. The _proclamation_ was
widely _circulated_. The president was _inaugurated_ on the 4th of March.

Pronunciation of Greek Words.

_Gamma_ has always the hard sound of _g_, as in _give_.

_Kappa_ is represented by _c_ in English words, although in Greek it has
but one sound, that of our _k_.

_Upsilon_ is represented by _y_ in English words; in Greek it has always
the sound of _u_ in mute.

_Chi_ is represented in English by _ch_ having the sound of _k_; as in
_chronic_.

In Greek words, as in Latin, there are always as many syllables as there
are vowels and diphthongs.

precedes that letter.

EXERCISE.

The _periods_ of _astronomy_ go far beyond any _chronology_. The
_phonograph_ and the _telegraph_ are both American inventions. By the aid
of a _diagram_ the _problem_ was readily solved. Dr. Holmes, the _Autocrat_
of the Breakfast Table, has written many _parodies_. In the struggle
between _monarchy_ and _democracy_ Mexico has often been in a state of
_anarchy_. His _antagonist_ suffered great _agony_ from the _disaster_ that
occurred. The _eulogy_ pronounced on the great _zooelogist_ Agassiz was well
deserved. What is the _etymological_ distinction between _geography_ and
_geology_? The _aeronaut_ took with him a _barometer_, a _thermometer_, and
a _chronometer_. I owe you an _apology_ for not better knowing your
_genealogy. Typography_ has been well called "the art preservative of all
the arts." Who is called the great American _lexicographer? Tautology_ is
to be avoided by all who make any pretence to _grammar_. One may be a
_democrat_ without being a _demagogue_. You cannot be an _architect_
without knowing _geometry. Zoology_ shows that there is great _symmetry_ in
the structure of animals. The pretensions of _astrology_ are now dissipated
into thin _air_. Many persons skilled in _physiology_ do not believe in
hydropathy. Longfellow's "Evangeline" is written in _hexameter_, and
Milton's "Paradise Lost" in _pentameter_.

ANGLO-SAXON ROOTS AND ENGLISH DERIVATIVES.

The pronunciation of Anglo-Saxon is much nearer to that of modern German or
the Continental pronunciation of Latin than of modern English.

The letters of the alphabet wanting in Anglo-Saxon are: _j_, _k_, _q_, _v_,
and _z_. _K_ is commonly represented by _c_; thus, _cyning_ (king) is
pronounced _kining_; _cyrtel_, _kirtle_; _qu_ is represented by _cw_, as
_cwic_, _quick_; _cwen_, _queen_; _cwellan_, to _quell_; _th_ is
represented by two peculiar characters, one of which in its reduced form
resembles _y_, as in _ye olden times_, where _ye_ should be pronounced
_the_, and not _ye_, as is often ignorantly done.

Long vowels should be carefully distinguished from short vowels. Long
vowels are _a_ as _far_, _ae_ as in _fare_, _e_ as in _they_, _i_ as in
_pique_, _o_ as in _bone_, _u_ as in _rule_, _y_ as in _i_ (nearly). Short
vowels are _a_ as in _fast_, _ae_ as in _man_, _e_ as in _men_, _i_ as in
_pin_, _o_ as in _God_, _u_ as in _full_, _y_ as in _i_ (nearly).

In the diphthongs _ea_, _eo_, and _ie_, the first element receives the
stress; the second is pronounced very lightly.

There are no silent letters in Anglo-Saxon as in modern English. The vowel
of every syllable is pronounced, and in difficult combinations of
consonants, as in _hlud_, loud, _cniht_, knight, _cnif_, knife, each
consonant has its distinct sound.

_E_ before _a_ and _o_ has the sound of _y_ as a consonant; _i_ before _e_
and _u_ has the same sound: thus, _Earl_ = _yarl_; _eow_ = _you_; _iett_ =
_yett_; and _iugoth_ = _yugoth_, youth.

Anglo-Saxon Element in Modern English.

That the young student may be made aware of the extent of the employment of
Anglo-Saxon in our present language, and that he may have some clue to
direct him to a knowledge of the Saxon words, the following extracts,
embracing a great proportion of these words, are submitted to his
attention. The words not Teutonic are marked in _Italics_.

MILTON.

    Of man's first _disobedience_, and the _fruit_
  Of that forbidden tree, whose _mortal taste_
  Brought death into the world, and all our woe,
  With loss of _Eden_, till one greater man
  _Restore_ us and _regain_ the blissful seat--
  Sing, heavenly _Muse_.

    With thee _conversing_, I forget all time,
  All _seasons_, and their _change_; all _please_ alike.
  Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
  With _charm_ of earliest birds; _pleasant_ the sun
  When first on this _delightful_ land he spreads
  His _orient_ beams on _herb_, tree, _fruit_, and _flower_,
  Glistering with dew; _fragrant_ the _fertile_ earth,
  After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
  Of _grateful_ evening mild; then _silent_ night
  With this her _solemn_ bird, and this fair moon,
  And these the _gems_ of heaven, her starry _train_.

SHAKESPEARE.

    To be, or not to be, that is the _question_;
  Whether 't is _nobler_ in the mind to _suffer_
  The stings and arrows of _outrageous fortune_,
  Or to take _arms_ against a sea of _troubles_,
  And, by _opposing_, end them? To die, to sleep;
  No more;--and by a sleep to say we end
  The heart_ache_ and the thousand _natural_ shocks
  That flesh is _heir_ to! 't were a _consummation_
  _Devoutly_ to be wished. To die; to sleep;
  To sleep?--_perchance_ to dream!

    All the world's a _stage_,
  And all the men and women _merely_ players.
  They have their _exits_ and their _entrances_,
  And one man in his time plays many _parts_;
  His _acts_ being seven _ages_. At first the _infant_,
  Mewling and puking in his _nurse's arms_.
  And then the whining _school_-boy, with his _satchel_
  And shining morning _face_, creeping like snail
  Unwillingly to _school_. And then the lover,
  Sighing like _furnace_, with a woeful _ballad_
  Made to his _mistress'_ eyebrow. Then a _soldier_,
  Full of _strange_ oaths, and bearded like the _pard_,
  _Jealous_ in _honour_, _sudden_ and quick in _quarrel_;
  Seeking the bubble _reputation_
  Even in the _cannon's_ mouth.

TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE.

In the beginning God _created_ the heaven and the earth. And the earth was
without _form_, and _void_; and darkness was upon the _face_ of the deep:
and the _Spirit_ of God _moved_ upon the _face_ of the waters. And God
said, Let there be light; and there was light. And God saw the light, that
it was good; and God _divided_ the light from the darkness. And God called
the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the
morning were the first day.--_Genesis_ i. 1-6.

And it came to _pass_, that when _Isaac_ was old, and his eyes were dim, so
that he could not see, he called _Esau_, his eldest son, and said unto him,
My son. And he said unto him, Behold, here am I. And he said, Behold now, I
am old, I know not the day of my death. Now therefore take, I _pray_ thee,
thy weapons, thy _quiver_ and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me
some _venison_; and make me _savoury_ meat, such as I love, and bring it to
me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. And _Rebekah_
heard when _Isaac_ spake to _Esau_ his son. And _Esau_ went to the field to
hunt for _venison_, and to bring it. And _Rebekah_ spake unto _Jacob_ her
son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto _Esau_ thy brother,
saying, Bring me _venison_, and make me _savoury_ meat, that I may eat, and
bless thee before the Lord before my death.--_Genesis_ xxvii. 1-7.

THOMSON.

    These as they _change_, Almighty Father! these
  Are but the _varied_ God. The _rolling_ year
  Is full of thee. Forth in the _pleasing_ spring
  Thy _beauty_ walks, thy _tenderness_ and love.
  Wide flush the fields; the softening _air_ is _balm_;
  _Echo_ the _mountains round_; the _forest_ smiles;
  And every _sense_ and every heart is _joy_.
  Then comes thy _glory_ in the summer months,
  With light and heat _refulgent_. Then thy sun
  Shoots full _perfection_ through the swelling year.

ADDISON.

I was yesterday, about sunset, walking in the open fields, till the night
_insensibly_ fell upon me. I at first _amused_ myself with all the richness
and _variety_ of _colours_ which _appeared_ in the western _parts_ of
heaven. In _proportion_ as they _faded_ away and went out, _several_ stars
and _planets appeared_, one after another, till the whole _firmament_ was
in a glow. The blueness of the _ether_ was _exceedingly_ heightened and
enlivened by the _season_ of the year.

YOUNG.

  Let _Indians_, and the _gay_, like _Indians_, fond
  Of feathered _fopperies_, the sun _adore_:
  Darkness has more _divinity_ for me;
  It strikes thought inward; it drives back the soul
  To settle on herself, our _point supreme_.
  There lies our _theater_: there sits our _judge_.
  Darkness the _curtain_ drops o'er life's dull _scene_:
  'T is the kind hand of _Providence_ stretched out
  'Twixt man and _vanity_; 't is _reason's reign_,
  And _virtue's_ too; these _tutelary_ shades
  Are man's _asylum_ from the _tainted_ throng.
  Night is the good man's friend, and guardian too.
  It no less _rescues virtue_, than _inspires_.

SWIFT.

Wisdom is a fox, who, after long hunting, will at last _cost_ you the
_pains_ to dig out. 'T is a cheese, which by how much the richer has the
thicker, homelier, and the _coarser coat_; and whereof, to a _judicious
palate_, the _maggots_ are the best. 'Tis a _sack posset_, wherein the
deeper you go on you will find it sweeter. But then, lastly, 'tis a nut,
which, unless you choose with _judgment_, may _cost_ you a tooth, and _pay_
you with nothing but a worm.

HUME.

The _beauties_ of her _person_ and _graces_ of her _air combined_ to make
her the most _amiable_ of women; and the _charms_ of her _address_ and
_conversation aided_ the _impression_ which her lovely _figure_ made on the
heart of all beholders. _Ambitious_ and _active_ in her _temper_, yet
_inclined_ to _cheerfulness_ and _society_; of a lofty _spirit_, _constant_
and even _vehement_ in her _purpose_, yet _politic, gentle_, and _affable_,
in her _demeanor_, she _seemed_ to _par_take only so much of the _male
virtues_ as to _render_ her _estimable_, without _relinquishing_ those soft
_graces_ which _compose_ the _proper ornament_ of her _sex_.

GIBBON.

In the _second century_ of the _Christian era_, the _empire_ of _Rome
comprehended_ the fairest _part_ of the earth, and the most _civilized
portion_ of mankind. The _frontiers_ of that _extensive monarchy_ were
guarded by _ancient renown_, and _disciplined valour_. The _gentle_ but
_powerful influence_ of laws and _manners_ had _gradually cemented_ the
_union_ of the _provinces_. Their _peaceful inhabitants enjoyed_ and
_abused_ the _advantages_ of wealth and _luxury_. The _image_ of a free
_constitution_ was _preserved_ with _decent reverence_.

JOHNSON.

Of _genius_, that _power_ which _constitutes_ a _poet_; that _quality_
without which _judgment_ is cold, and knowledge is _inert_; that _energy_
which _collects_, _combines_, _amplifies_, and _animates_; the
_superiority_ must, with some _hesitation_, be _allowed_ to Dryden. It is
not to be _inferred_ that of this _poetical vigor Pope_ had only a little,
_because_ Dryden had more; for every other writer since Milton must give
_place_ to _Pope_; and even of Dryden it must be said, that if he has
brighter _paragraphs_, he has not better _poems_.

BYRON.

  _Ancient_ of days! _august Athena!_ where,
  Where are thy men of might--thy _grand_ in soul?
  Gone--glimmering through the dream of things that were.
  First in the race that led to _Glory's goal_,
  They won, and _passed_ away. Is this the whole?
  A _school_-boy's tale--the wonder of an _hour_!
  The warrior's-weapon and the _sophist's stole_
  Are sought in _vain_, and o'er each _mouldering_ tower,
  Dim with the mist of years, gray flits the shade of _power_.

SIR WALTER SCOTT.

  The way was long, the wind was cold,
  The _Minstrel_ was _infirm_ and old;
  His withered cheek and _tresses_ gray
  _Seemed_ to have known a better day;
  The harp, his _sole remaining joy_,
  Was carried by an _orphan_ boy.
  The last of all the bards was he
  Who sung of border _chivalry_;
  For, well-a-day! their _dale_ was fled;
  His _tune_ful brethren all were dead;
  And he, _neglected_ and _oppressed_,
  Wished to be with them and at rest.

WORDSWORTH.

  Ah! little doth the young one dream,
  When full of play and childish cares,
  What _power_ is in his wildest scream,
  Heard by his mother unawares!
  He knows it not, he cannot guess;
  Years to a mother bring _distress_;
  But do not make her love the less.

  My son, if thou be _humbled_, _poor_,
  Hopeless of _honor_ and of _gain_,
  Oh! do not dread thy mother's door;
  Think not of me with _grief_ and _pain_.
  I now can see with better eyes;
  And worldly _grandeur_ I _despise_,
  And _Fortune_ with her gifts and lies.

TENNYSON.

  Not wholly in the busy world, nor _quite_
  Beyond it, blooms the garden that I love.
  News from the humming _city_ comes to it
  In _sound_ of _funeral_ or of _marriage_ bells;
  And sitting muffled in dark leaves you hear
  The windy clanging of the winter clock;
  Although between it and the garden lies
  A _league_ of grass, washed by a slow broad stream,
  That, stirred with _languid pulses_ of the oar,
  Waves all its lazy _lilies_, and creeps on,
  Barge laden, to three _arches_ of a bridge,
  _Crowned_ with the _minster-towers_.

NOTES.

[1] To teachers who are unacquainted with the original _Word-Analysis_, the
following extract from the Preface to that work may not be out of place:--

"The treatment of the Latin derivatives in Part II. presents a new and
important feature, to wit: the systematic analysis of the structure and
organism of derivative words, together with the statement of their primary
meaning in such form that the pupil inevitably perceives its relation with
the root, and in fact _makes_ its primary meaning by the very process of
analyzing the word into its primitive and its modifying prefix or suffix.
It presents, also, a marked improvement in the method of approaching the
definition,--a method by which the definition is seen to _grow out of_ the
primary meaning, and by which the analytic faculty of the pupil is
exercised in tracing the transition from the primary meaning to the
secondary and figurative meanings,--thus converting what is ordinarily a
matter of rote into an agreeable exercise of the thinking faculty. Another
point of novelty in the method of treatment is presented in the copious
practical exercises on the _use of words_. The experienced instructor very
well knows that pupils may memorize endless lists of terms and definitions
without having any realization of the actual living power of words. Such a
realization can only be gained by _using_ the word,--by turning it over in
a variety of ways, and by throwing upon it the side-lights of its synonym
and contrasted word. The method of thus utilizing English derivatives gives
a study which possesses at once _simplicity_ and _fruitfulness_,--the two
desiderata of an instrument of elementary discipline."

[2] "Etymology," Greek _et'umon_, the true literal sense of a word
according to its derivation, and _log'os_, a discourse.

[3] "Vocabulary," Latin _vocabula'rium_, a stock of words; from _vox,
vocis_, a voice, a word.

[4] By the _Low_ German languages are meant those spoken in the low, flat
countries of North Germany, along the coast of the North Sea (as Dutch, the
language of Holland); and they are so called in contradistinction to _High_
German, or German proper.

[5] For the full definition, reference should be had to a dictionary; but
in the present exercise the literal or etymological signification may
suffice.

[6] _Fen'do_, _fen'dere_, is used in Latin only in composition.

[7] Another mode of spelling _defense_.

[8] From _pass_ and _over_, a feast of the Jews instituted to commemorate
the providential escape of the Jews to Egypt, when God, smiting the
first-born of the Egyptians _passed over_ the houses of the Israelites,
which were marked with the blood of the paschal lamb.

[9] For the explanation of the etymology see Webster's _Unabridged_.

[10] _For_ is different from _fore_, and corresponds to the German _ver_,
different from _vor_.

_A_, _be_, _for_, _ge_, are often indifferently prefixed to verbs,
especially to perfect tenses and perfect participles, as well as to verbal
nouns.--BOSWORTH.

[11] _Ster_ was the Anglo-Saxon feminine termination. Females once
conducted the work of brewing, baking, etc., hence brewster, baxter; these
words were afterwards applied to men when they undertook the same work.
_Ster_ is now used in depreciating, as in trickster, youngster.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
