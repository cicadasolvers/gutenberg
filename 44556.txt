     =At Agincourt:= A Tale of the White Hoods of Paris. With 12 page
     Illustrations by WAL PAGET. 6_s._

"Mr. Henty's admirers, and they are many, will accord a hearty welcome
to the sturdy volume entitled _At Agincourt_."--_Athenaeum._

     =With Cochrane the Dauntless:= A Tale of the Exploits of Lord
     Cochrane in South American Waters. With 12 page Illustrations by
     W. H. MARGETSON. 6_s._

"This tale we specially recommend; for the career of Lord Cochrane and
his many valiant fights in the cause of liberty deserves to be better
known than they are."--_St. James's Gazette._

     =The Tiger of Mysore:= A Story of the War with Tippoo Saib.
     By G. A. HENTY. With 12 Illustrations by W. H.
     MARGETSON, and a Map. 6_s._

"Mr. Henty not only concocts a thrilling tale, he weaves fact and
fiction together with so skilful a hand that the reader cannot help
acquiring a just and clear view of that fierce and terrible struggle
which gave to us our Indian Empire."--_Athenaeum._

     =A Knight of the White Cross:= A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes. By
     G. A. HENTY. With 12 full-page Illustrations by RALPH
     PEACOCK. 6_s._

"Mr. Henty is a giant among boys' writers, and his books are
sufficiently popular to be sure of a welcome anywhere.... In stirring
interest, this is quite up to the level of Mr. Henty's former
historical tales."--_Saturday Review._

     =When London Burned:= A Story of Restoration Times and the Great
     Fire. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by
     J. FINNEMORE. 6_s._

"No boy needs to have any story of Henty's recommended to him, and
parents who do not know and buy him for their boys should be ashamed
of themselves. Those to whom he is yet unknown could not make a better
beginning than with _When London Burned_."--_British Weekly._


BY G. A. HENTY

"Among writers of stories of adventure for boys Mr. Henty stands in the
very first rank."--_Academy._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =The Lion of St. Mark:= A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth
     Century. By G. A. HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by
     GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"Every boy should read _The Lion of St. Mark_. Mr. Henty has never
produced any story more delightful, more wholesome, or more vivacious.
From first to last it will be read with keen enjoyment."--_The Saturday
Review._

     =By England's Aid:= The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604).
     By G. A. HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by ALFRED
     PEARSE, and 4 Maps. 6_s._

"The story is told with great animation, and the historical material
is most effectively combined with a most excellent plot."--_Saturday
Review._

     =With Wolfe in Canada:= or, The Winning of a Continent. By G.
     A. HENTY. Illustrated with 12 page Pictures by GORDON
     BROWNE. 6_s._

"A model of what a boys' story-book should be. Mr. Henty has a great
power of infusing into the dead facts of history new life, and as no
pains are spared by him to ensure accuracy in historic details, his
books supply useful aids to study as well as amusement."--_School
Guardian._

     =Bonnie Prince Charlie:= A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden. By
     G. A. HENTY. Illustrated with 12 page Pictures by
     GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of _Quentin Durward_. The
lad's journey across France with his faithful attendant Malcolm, and
his hairbreadth escapes from the machinations of his father's enemies
make up as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read. For
freshness of treatment and variety of incident, Mr. Henty has here
surpassed himself."--_Spectator._

     =For the Temple:= A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem. By G. A.
     HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON,
     and a Coloured Map. 6_s._

"Mr. Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish resistance
to Roman sway adds another leaf to his record of the famous wars of the
world. The book is one of Mr. Henty's cleverest efforts."--_Graphic._

     =True to the Old Flag:= A Tale of the American War of
     Independence. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations
     by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British soldiers.
The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to our flag, falls
among the hostile redskins in that very Huron country which has been
endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye and Chingachgook."--_The
Times._

"Mr. Henty undoubtedly possesses the secret of writing eminently
successful historical tales; and those older than the lads whom
the author addresses in his preface may read the story with
pleasure."--_Academy._

_Specimen Illustration from_

"_WITH COCHRANE THE DAUNTLESS_".

[Illustration: STEPHEN BEATS OFF THE GREAT WAR-CANOE SINGLE-HANDED.]


BY G. A. HENTY.

"Mr. Henty is one of our most successful writers of historical
tales."--_Scotsman._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =The Lion of the North:= A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars
     of Religion. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Pictures by
     J. SCHOeNBERG. 6_s._

"A praiseworthy attempt to interest British youth in the great deeds of
the Scotch Brigade in the wars of Gustavus Adolphus. Mackay, Hepburn,
and Munro live again in Mr. Henty's pages, as those deserve to live
whose disciplined bands formed really the germ of the modern British
army."--_Athenaeum._

     =The Young Carthaginian:= A Story of the Times of Hannibal. By
     G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by C. J.
     STANILAND, R.I. 6_s._

"The effect of an interesting story, well constructed and vividly told,
is enhanced by the picturesque quality of the scenic background. From
first to last nothing stays the interest of the narrative. It bears us
along as on a stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses
its force."--_Saturday Review._

     =Redskin and Cow-boy:= A Tale of the Western Plains. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by ALFRED PEARSE. 6_s._

"It has a good plot; it abounds in action; the scenes are equally
spirited and realistic, and we can only say we have read it with much
pleasure from first to last. The pictures of life on a cattle ranch are
most graphically painted, as are the manners of the reckless but jovial
cow-boys."--_Times._

     =With Clive in India:= or, The Beginnings of an Empire. By G.
     A. HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"Among writers of stories of adventure for boys Mr. Henty stands in the
very first rank. Those who know something about India will be the most
ready to thank Mr. Henty for giving them this instructive volume to
place in the hands of their children."--_Academy._

     =In Greek Waters:= A Story of the Grecian War of Independence
     (1821-1827). By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations
     by W. S. STACEY, and a Map. 6_s._

"There are adventures of all kinds for the hero and his friends, whose
pluck and ingenuity in extricating themselves from awkward fixes are
always equal to the occasion. It is an excellent story, and if the
proportion of history is smaller than usual, the whole result leaves
nothing to be desired."--_Journal of Education._

     =The Dash for Khartoum:= A Tale of the Nile Expedition. By G.
     A. HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by J. SCHOeNBERG
     and J. NASH, and 4 Plans. 6_s._

"It is literally true that the narrative never flags a moment; for the
incidents which fall to be recorded after the dash for Khartoum has
been made and failed are quite as interesting as those which precede
it."--_Academy._


BY G. A. HENTY.

"Mr. Henty is the king of story-tellers for boys."--_Sword and Trowel._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =Through the Fray:= A Story of the Luddite Riots. By G. A.
     HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.
     6_s._

"Mr. Henty inspires a love and admiration for straightforwardness,
truth, and courage. This is one of the best of the many good books
Mr. Henty has produced, and deserves to be classed with his _Facing
Death_."--_Standard._

     =Captain Bayley's Heir:= A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.
     By G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by H. M. PAGET. 6_s._

"A Westminster boy who makes his way in the world by hard work, good
temper, and unfailing courage. The descriptions given of life are
just what a healthy intelligent lad should delight in."--_St. James's
Gazette._

[Illustration: _Reduced Illustration from "A Knight of the White
Cross"._]

     =St. Bartholomew's Eve:= A Tale of the Huguenot Wars. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by H. J. DRAPER. 6_s._

"What would boys do without Mr. Henty? Ever fresh and vigorous, his
books have at once the solidity of history and the charm of romance.
_St. Bartholomew's Eve_ is in his best style, and the interest never
flags. The book is all that could possibly be wished from a boy's point
of view."--_Journal of Education._

     =In Freedom's Cause:= A Story of Wallace and Bruce. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"His tale of the days of Wallace and Bruce is full of stirring action,
and will commend itself to boys."--_Athenaeum._

     =By Right of Conquest=: or, With Cortez in Mexico. By G. A.
     HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY.
     6_s._

"_By Right of Conquest_ is the nearest approach to a
perfectly successful historical tale that Mr. Henty has yet
published."--_Academy._


BY G. A. HENTY.

"Mr. Henty is one of the best of story-tellers for young
people."--_Spectator._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =Beric the Briton:= A Story of the Roman Invasion. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by W. PARKINSON. 6_s._

"We are not aware that anyone has given us quite so vigorous a picture
of Britain in the days of the Roman conquest. Mr. Henty has done his
utmost to make an impressive picture of the haughty Roman character,
with its indomitable courage, sternness, and discipline. _Beric_ is
good all through."--_Spectator._

     =By Pike and Dyke:= A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic. By
     G. A. HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by MAYNARD
     BROWN, and 4 Maps. 6_s._

"The mission of Ned to deliver letters from William the Silent to his
adherents at Brussels, the fight of the _Good Venture_ with the Spanish
man-of-war, the battle on the ice at Amsterdam, the siege of Haarlem,
are all told with a vividness and skill which are worthy of Mr. Henty
at his best."--_Academy._

[Illustration: _Reduced Illustration from "At Agincourt"._]

     =Wulf the Saxon:= A Story of the Norman Conquest. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by RALPH PEACOCK. 6_s._

"_Wulf the Saxon_ is second to none of Mr. Henty's historical tales,
and we may safely say that a boy may learn from it more genuine
history than he will from many a tedious tome. The points of the Saxon
character are hit off very happily, and the life of the period is ably
reconstructed."--_The Spectator._

     =Through the Sikh War:= A Tale of the Conquest of the Punjaub.
     By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by HAL
     HURST, and a Map. 6_s._

"The picture of the Punjaub during its last few years of independence,
the description of the battles on the Sutlej, and the portraiture
generally of native character, seem admirably true.... On the whole,
we have never read a more vivid and faithful narrative of military
adventure in India."--_The Academy._


BY G. A. HENTY.

"No more interesting boys' books are written than Mr. Henty's
stories."--_Daily Chronicle._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =With Lee in Virginia:= A Story of the American Civil War. By
     G. A. HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by GORDON
     BROWNE, and 6 Maps. 6_s._

"The story is a capital one and full of variety, and presents us with
many picturesque scenes of Southern life. Young Wingfield, who is
conscientious, spirited, and 'hard as nails', would have been a man
after the very heart of Stonewall Jackson."--_Times._

     =Under Drake's Flag:= A Tale of the Spanish Main. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"There is not a dull chapter, nor, indeed, a dull page in the book; but
the author has so carefully worked up his subject that the exciting
deeds of his heroes are never incongruous or absurd."--_Observer._

     =On the Irrawaddy:= A Story of the first Burmese War. With 8
     Illustrations by W. H. OVEREND. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant,
     olivine edges, 5_s._

"Stanley Brook's pluck is even greater than his luck, and he is
precisely the boy to hearten with emulation the boys who read his
stirring story."--_Saturday Review._

     =Through Russian Snows:= A Story of Napoleon's Retreat from
     Moscow. By G. A. HENTY. With 8 Illustrations by W. H.
     OVEREND, and a Map. 5_s._

"Julian, the hero of the story, early excites our admiration, and is
altogether a fine character such as boys will delight in, whilst the
story of the campaign is very graphically told.... Will, we think,
prove one of the most popular boys' books this season."--_St. James's
Gazette._

     =In the Heart of the Rockies:= A Story of Adventure in Colorado.
     By G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by G. C. HINDLEY.
     5_s._

"Few Christmas books will be more to the taste of the ingenuous boy
than _In the Heart of the Rockies_."--_Athenaeum._

"Mr. Henty is seen here at his best as an artist in lightning
fiction."--_Academy._

     =One of the 28th:= A Tale of Waterloo. By G. A. HENTY.
     With 8 page Illustrations by W. H. OVEREND, and 2 Maps.
     5_s._

"Written with Homeric vigour and heroic inspiration. It is graphic,
picturesque, and dramatically effective ... shows us Mr. Henty at his
best and brightest. The adventures will hold a boy of a winter's night
enthralled as he rushes through them with breathless interest 'from
cover to cover'."--_Observer._

     =Facing Death:= or, The Hero of the Vaughan Pit. A Tale of the
     Coal Mines. By G. A. HENTY. With 8 page Pictures by
     GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

"If any father, godfather, clergyman, or schoolmaster is on the
look-out for a good book to give as a present to a boy who is worth his
salt, this is the book we would recommend."--_Standard._


BY G. A. HENTY.

"Ask for Henty, and see that you get him."--_Punch._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =The Cat of Bubastes:= A Story of Ancient Egypt. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by J. R. WEGUELIN. 5_s._

"The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
skilfully constructed and full of exciting adventures. It is admirably
illustrated."--_Saturday Review._

     =Maori and Settler:= A Story of the New Zealand War. By G. A.
     HENTY. With 8 page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE.
     5_s._

"It is a book which all young people, but especially boys, will read
with avidity."--_Athenaeum._

and interesting conversation, and of vivid pictures of colonial
life."--_Schoolmaster._

     =St. George for England:= A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers. By G.
     A. HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

"A story of very great interest for boys. In his own forcible style
the author has endeavoured to show that determination and enthusiasm
can accomplish marvellous results; and that courage is generally
accompanied by magnanimity and gentleness."--_Pall Mall Gazette._

     =The Bravest of the Brave:= With Peterborough in Spain. By G.
     A. HENTY. With 8 full-page Pictures by H. M. PAGET.
     5_s._

"Mr. Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
enforce the doctrine of courage and truth, mercy and lovingkindness, as
indispensable to the making of an English gentleman. British lads will
read _The Bravest of the Brave_ with pleasure and profit; of that we
are quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._

     =For Name and Fame:= or, Through Afghan Passes. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

"Not only a rousing story, replete with all the varied forms of
excitement of a campaign, but, what is still more useful, an account
of a territory and its inhabitants which must for a long time possess
a supreme interest for Englishmen, as being the key to our Indian
Empire."--_Glasgow Herald._

     =A Jacobite Exile:= Being the Adventures of a Young Englishman in
     the Service of Charles XII. of Sweden. By G. A. HENTY.
     With 8 page Illustrations by PAUL HARDY, and a Map. 5_s._

"Incident succeeds incident, and adventure is piled upon adventure,
and at the end the reader, be he boy or man, will have experienced
breathless enjoyment in a romantic story that must have taught him much
at its close."--_Army and Navy Gazette._

     =Held Fast for England:= A Tale of the Siege of Gibraltar. By
     G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

"Among them we would place first in interest and wholesome educational
value the story of the siege of Gibraltar.... There is no cessation of
exciting incident throughout the story."--_Athenaeum._


BY G. A. HENTY.

"Mr. Henty's books are always alive with moving incident."--_Review of
Reviews._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant._

     =Condemned as a Nihilist:= A Story of Escape from Siberia. By
     G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by WALTER PAGET. 5_s._

"The best of this year's Henty. His narrative is more interesting than
many of the tales with which the public is familiar, of escape from
Siberia. Despite their superior claim to authenticity these tales are
without doubt no less fictitious than Mr. Henty's, and he beats them
hollow in the matter of sensations."--_National Observer._

     =Orange and Green:= A Tale of the Boyne and Limerick. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

"The narrative is free from the vice of prejudice, and ripples with
life as vivacious as if what is being described were really passing
before the eye.... Should be in the hands of every young student of
Irish history."--_Belfast News._

     =In the Reign of Terror:= The Adventures of a Westminster Boy. By
     G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by J. SCHOeNBERG. 5_s._

"Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat Mr.
Henty's record. His adventures will delight boys by the audacity and
peril they depict. The story is one of Mr. Henty's best."--_Saturday
Review._

     =By Sheer Pluck:= A Tale of the Ashanti War. By G. A.
     HENTY. With 8 full-page Pictures by GORDON BROWNE.
     5_s._

"Morally, the book is everything that could be desired, setting
before the boys a bright and bracing ideal of the English
gentleman."--_Christian Leader._

     =The Dragon and the Raven:= or, The Days of King Alfred. By G.
     A. HENTY. With 8 page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND,
     R.I. 5_s._

"A story that may justly be styled remarkable. Boys, in reading it,
will be surprised to find how Alfred persevered, through years of
bloodshed and times of peace, to rescue his people from the thraldom
of the Danes. We hope the book will soon be widely known in all our
schools."--_Schoolmaster._

     =A Final Reckoning:= A Tale of Bush Life in Australia. By G.
     A. HENTY. Illustrated by W. B. WOLLEN. 5_s._

"All boys will read this story with eager and unflagging interest.
The episodes are in Mr. Henty's very best vein--graphic, exciting,
realistic; and, as in all Mr. Henty's books, the tendency is
to the formation of an honourable, manly, and even heroic
character."--_Birmingham Post._

     =The Young Colonists:= A Tale of the Zulu and Boer Wars. By G.
     A. HENTY. With 6 Illustrations by SIMON H. VEDDER.
     3_s._ 6_d._

"Fiction and history are so happily blended that the record of
facts quicken the imagination. No boy can read this book without
learning a great deal of South African history at its most critical
period."--_Standard._

     =A Chapter of Adventures=: or, Through the Bombardment of
     Alexandria. By G. A. HENTY. With 6 page Illustrations by
     W. H. OVEREND. 3_s._ 6_d._

"Jack Robson and his two companions have their fill of excitement, and
their chapter of adventures is so brisk and entertaining we could have
wished it longer than it is."--_Saturday Review._


BY KIRK MUNROE.

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =Through Swamp and Glade:= A Tale of the Seminole War. By KIRK
     MUNROE. Illustrated by VICTOR PERARD. 5_s._

"The hero of _Through Swamp and Glade_ will find many ardent champions,
and the name of Coachoochie become as familiar in the schoolboy's ear
as that of the headmaster."--_St. James's Gazette._

     =At War With Pontiac:= or, The Totem of the Bear. By KIRK
     MUNROE. Illustrated by J. FINNEMORE. 5_s._

"Is in the best manner of Cooper. There is a character who is the
parallel of Hawkeye, as the Chingachgooks and Uncas have likewise their
counterparts."--_The Times._

     =The White Conquerors of Mexico:= A Tale of Toltec and Aztec. By
     KIRK MUNROE. Illustrated by W. S. STACEY. 5_s._

"Mr. Munroe gives most vivid pictures of the religious and civil polity
of the Aztecs, and of everyday life, as he imagines it, in the streets
and market-places of the magnificent capital of Montezuma."--_The
Times._


_Crown 8vo, cloth elegant_.

     =Two Thousand Years Ago:= or, The Adventures of a Roman Boy. By
     Professor A. J. CHURCH. With 12 page Illustrations by
     ADRIEN MARIE. 6_s._

"Adventures well worth the telling. The book is extremely entertaining
as well as useful, and there is a wonderful freshness in the Roman
scenes and characters."--_The Times._


     =The Clever Miss Follett.= By J. K. H. DENNY. With 12
     page Illustrations by GERTRUDE D. HAMMOND. 6_s._

"Just the book to give to girls, who will delight both in the
letterpress and the illustrations. Miss Hammond has never done better
work."--_Review of Reviews._


     =The Heiress of Courtleroy.= By ANNE BEALE. With 8 page
     Illustrations by T. C. H. CASTLE. 5_s._

young 'Heiress of Courtleroy' had such good influence over her uncle as
to win him from his intensely selfish ways."--_Guardian._


     =Under False Colours:= A Story from Two Girls' Lives. By SARAH
     DOUDNEY. Illustrated by G. G. KILBURNE. 4_s._

"Sarah Doudney has no superior as a writer of high-toned stories--pure
in style and original in conception; but we have seen nothing from her
pen equal in dramatic energy to this book."--_Christian Leader._


BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.

"Mr. Fenn stands in the foremost rank of writers in this
department."--_Daily News._

     MANVILLE FENN. Illustrated by FRANK DADD. 6_s._

"We conscientiously believe that boys will find it capital reading.
It is full of incident and mystery, and the mystery is kept up to the
last moment. It is rich in effective local colouring; and it has a
historical interest."--_Times._

     =Devon Boys:= A Tale of the North Shore. By G. MANVILLE

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
